However, what caught the attention of internet users was that Virat liked the post and then disliked it too. The activity was shared on his fan pages, where people started commenting with, ""Kohlisaabwhat is this behaviour?""
While someone else said, ""Akaaybetapapakophonedo.""
Virat has now reacted to the ongoing rumours, as he put up a story on his Instagram.
The story reads, ""I'd like to clarify that while clearing my feed, it appears the algorithm may have mistakenly registered an interaction. There was absolutely no intent behind it. I request that no unnecessary assumptions be made. Thank you for your understanding.""

They feature his wife, actress Priyanka Chopra and daughter Malti Marie Jonas. From the possibility of a duet with PeeCee to Maltie's holistic upbringing, the singer-actor has spilled it all.
Nick Jonas recently appeared on SiriusXM's Andy Cohen Live podcast. He was accompanied by actress, singer  Adrienne Warre. The duo has worked together in the Broadway musicalThe Last Five Years.
During the conversation, the host wanted to know whether Nick Jonas was planning on collaborating with Priyanka Chopra for a song. To this, the actor had a befitting reply.
Nick Jonas said, “I don't know. She's an amazing singer and she's shooting a movie in India right now and she's travelling back and forth to the US. I think our best duet is probably our little girl. She's 3.
In another segment, Nick Jonas heaped praises on Priyanka Chopra for her unwavering support.  She's in nursery school, she's in karate class, got her first belt.”
He said, “Having a partner that's not only supportive of your ambition and your desire to do a good job, but genuinely just shows up and comes to cheer you is a dream scenario.”
Nick Jonas added that his wife also offered him suggestions to improve his performance inThe Last Five Years.
He said, “We talk a lot about work, and before Adrienne and I started rehearsing, I certainly was singing the music around the house and talking and probably pontificating for longer than I should have. But that's the beauty of this partnership and frankly, the thing I'm most grateful for about our marriage is the ability to share, kind of, life together and a humongous part of both of our lives is our work.”
Nick Jonas added, “It does naturally sort of become one thing, one mind, one thought. And so it's probably not framed as notes, but just like, ‘Here's some thoughts, let's workshop that a bit'.”

Nick Jonas and Priyanka Chopra got married in 2018. The couple welcomed Malti Marie Jonas in 2022 via surrogacy.

Things got so intense that Ashish Hemrajani, CEO and Founder of BookMyShow, was even summoned by the police.
Now, Ashish has finally opened up about the chaos during a panel discussion with NDTV at the World Audio Visual and Entertainment Summit. He was joined by Viraf Sarkari, Co-founder of Wizcraft International Entertainment and Vivien Lewit, Global Head of Artists at YouTube.
Addressing the issue,Ashish Hemrajanisaid, “There were a lot of things that were said during the booking phase about us. I think that is a little bit of maturity that is needed in the market. We are 1.4 billion Indians. It's a huge country. We had millions of people that were in the queue, trying to buy. In Bombay, it was 50,000 into threeshows– that is 150,000. In Ahmedabad, it was about 110,000 into two shows – that is 220,000 tickets.”
“So we are talking about 370,000 tickets. Now, you know, there was a lot that was said. The queue was transparent. The token numbers were transparent. We have every customer's email ID, mobile number, device ID, transaction ID, and home address because we deliver the tickets to your home,” he added.
Talking about the band's massive popularity and backing up the math behind the overwhelming ticket demand, Ashish Hemrajani said, “So the supply-demand — if you see the numbers on YouTube today, you see the numbers of streaming for a band like Coldplay. They are the world's biggest band. They are the highest-ticketed band.”
“We have a large population, which is now a discerning, young demographic, which has disposable income. Where does the math go wrong? It's just that somebody didn't look at it. The appetite is there. The math is very much there,” he concluded.
For the unversed, Coldplay had a total of five concerts in India between January 18 and 26. When the tickets went live on BookMyShow in September, millions of people flooded the platform, trying to book their spots. In no time, tickets were being resold on other sites at insanely inflated prices.
Although BookMyShow claimed it had no involvement in the black market and even filed a police complaint to support that, the Economic Offences Wing (EOW) of the Mumbai Police still summoned CEO Ashish Hemrajani to explain what went wrong.NDTV is at the inaugural edition of the Waves Summit, currently on at the Jio World Centre in Mumbai. The event brings together the who's who of showbiz, creators, and everyone who's anyone in the world of entertainment in India and beyond. Catch all updates on NDTV.com, from May 1 to May 4.

Addressing the WAVES 2025, Nagarjuna stated there is a reason why Allu Arjun'sPushpafranchise earned more in Hindi than Telugu, as the audience in the North was craving to see stars in a tentpole movie set-up, like the Sukumar directorial or Yash's blockbusterKGFseries.
""Both thePushpafilms made more money in the North than in Telugu. We have seen similar stories in Telugu before, likePushpa, which has larger-than-life heroes. Whereas in the North—in Bihar, UP, and Punjab—they wanted to see their heroes like Pushpa Raj, Yash inKGForBaahubali. They wanted to see larger-than-life heroes. For Indian people and culture, just living day to day is difficult, and when they want to overcome the stress by watching films, they want to see magic on screen,"" he said.
TheBangarrajuactress added, ""That's what the larger-than-life stories are doing, without losing the fundamentals of Indian storytelling. They are not going away from that, which is why they have been successful. Rajamouli shotBaahubaliframe to frame, thinking it is a Telugu film. He was very proud of his roots and language, and he shot it like a Telugu film, and people loved it across the world! If you are rooted in your storytelling, it will resonate.""
Nagarjuna said that Indian films have their own, unique storytelling DNA, which one must be proud of.
""You might say, 'A guy raises his fist and 20 people fall, it looks abnormal!' But if you likeMarvelorDCfilms, Superman does the same thing, but they give the logic of them having 'super powers.' But we don't need those special powers! The common man, the ticket-paying audience, including me, wants to watch my heroes larger-than-life. When I see Prabhas, Allu Arjun, and others going on screen and doing what they do, I clap and whistle"", theBrahmastraactor concluded.
Nagarjuna was speaking on the panel discussion 'Pan-Indian Cinema; Myth Or Momentum?,' where he was joined by actors Anupam Kher, Khusbhu, and Karthi.

But the ambition, according to key industry voices, must go beyond replicating old formulas. It requires identifying gaps, thinking hyper-locally, and scaling creatively for international relevance.
Speaking to NDTV's Editor-in-Chief, Sanjay Pugalia, on the second day of the World Audio Visual and Entertainment Summit (WAVES), Gaurav Gandhi, Vice President of Amazon Prime Video, reflected on the platform's eight-year journey in India.
He said, ""Our journey with Prime Video India has been over eight years. It's been amazing for us - full of learning and a lot of love from customers."" He added, ""When we started, we realised that to make an impact in India, you have to think local. As a market and as a country, we are so diverse that there's no single definition of 'local'. So, we had to think in multiple ways - local tastes, local languages, local milieu.""
This approach, he said, was rooted in identifying what the Indian ecosystem lacked. He shared, ""The first gap was the absence of high cinematic-value storytelling in India, which was already present internationally. The second gap was in movies - while we made a lot of them, there weren't enough theatres to screen them. The third was that everyone was locked into their own language. Keeping these three things in mind, we tried to bridge the gaps.""
Filmmaker Vikramaditya Motwane pointed out how the rise of streaming platforms has given creators the freedom they didn't have 10 to 15 years ago.
He stated, ""From where we were 10-15 years ago - when there was only one format and films were made only for the big screen - to now, the landscape has changed entirely,"" he said. ""Platforms like Prime Video and other streaming services have given creators the freedom to think beyond just a two-hour film in a theatre. Now you can make a crime series with multiple seasons and episodes. You can do a comedy series, something like Jubilee or Mumbai Diaries - there's so much freedom to tell stories.""
Motwane believes India is still in the early stages of this shift. He added, ""We're at a stage where filmmakers are discovering this freedom and just going for it. But I don't think we've reached the point where we've fully taken advantage of it yet. When that happens, the next step will be to create stories that not only work in India but also travel globally. That's when we'll truly enter the next generation of Indian storytelling,"" he said. ""Ten to fifteen years ago, people thought Indian content meant only Bollywood. That stereotype has broken, and over time, it will continue to break with different types of shows, films, and creators.""
Director Nikkhil Advani, who is currently busy with his upcoming revolutionaries, believes that historical storytelling must feel alive, not academic. ""Whenever you're working on something related to a historical period, the richer and more authentic the material, the better the starting point,"" he said. ""I did Rocket Boys, and now I'm working on Revolutionaries. It's always about the source material,"" he said.
Advani's approach is clear: entertain first, educate later. ""In the case of Revolutionaries, I'm having a lot of fun making it. The first thing I say is, 'Let's make revolutionaries sexy. Let's have fun with it.' Because if you give people a history lesson, their reaction is usually, 'nahi sunna hai, nahi dekhna hai' (don't want to listen, don't want to watch),"" he concluded.
According to the PMO, WAVES 2025 will host participants from over 90 countries, including more than 10,000 delegates, 1,000 creators, 300+ companies and 350+ startups.

Speaking to NDTV's Editor-in-Chief, Sanjay Pugalia, on the second day of the World Audio Visual and Entertainment Summit (WAVES), Aamir Khan highlighted the vast potential for collaboration between the two countries in cinema and creative content.
Aamir was on a panel named ""Indian Cinema, Oriental Look"" alongside Peter Ho Sun Chan, Stanley Tong and Prasad Shetty.
The spotlight was on Aamir, whose films - particularlyDangal(2016) - have seen phenomenal success in the Chinese market.
Offering insight into the emotional resonance between the two nations' audiences, Khan said, ""I've had the opportunity to visit China quite a few times over the last 6-10 years, and there's a lot I'd like to share. The audiences in China - their cultural sensibilities and emotional responses - are remarkably similar to those in India. From my experience, the way Chinese audiences reacted to my films, especiallyDangal, was almost identical to how Indian audiences responded. The emotions were universal.""
The actor went on to outline the creative and business opportunities such partnerships could bring. He shared, ""I truly believe there is immense potential here, for several reasons. First, India has a vibrant and dynamic creative community - and so does China. I've witnessed their events and films, and the quality of their work is truly world-class.""
He added, ""Whether from a creative, emotional, or business perspective, I think it's a win-win if we collaborate. Over the years, I've had many discussions with my friends from China about exploring these possibilities. Now, with initiatives like WAVES gaining momentum, this collaboration will likely get an even stronger push.""
""India and China are both ancient civilisations with rich histories and cultures. There's so much we can offer each other. I genuinely look forward to collaborating with creative talent from China,"" he concluded.
Aamir's statement comes at a time when India is aiming to position itself as a global content hub under the vision of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has repeatedly emphasised the importance of soft power in global diplomacy.
According to the PMO, WAVES 2025 will host participants from over 90 countries, including more than 10,000 delegates, 1,000 creators, 300+ companies and 350+ startups.

The makers of the K-drama recently unveiled a teaser that hints at a thrilling mix of adrenaline, emotion and second chances as Olympic athletes trade gold medals for police badges.
The 50-second teaser kicks off on a triumphant note, spotlighting each character's athletic glory.
Park Bo Gum is introduced as boxing champion Yoon Dong Joo, Kim So Hyun stuns as a sharpshooting prodigy, and Lee Sang Yi's fencing finesse is on full display. Joined by Heo Sung Tae and Tae Won Suk, the team is a force of sporting excellence.
But the teaser quickly pivots. Gone are the cheers and confetti - instead, viewers are plunged into a world of broken dreams and odd jobs.
From a restless Dong Joo sitting alone in a rundown car to a mascot-suited discus thrower trudging through monotony, the visuals reflect the weight of dashed hopes.
As these former athletes are roped into a rookie cop program, their camaraderie begins to grow - and so does the danger. A shadowy villain from Inseong City looms large, pushing them to revive their long-dormant skills.
Dubbed the ""Goodvengers,"" this unlikely squad rises to meet the chaos head-on, with Park Bo Gum's defiant closing line - ""The round isn't over until we've taken down our opponent"" - delivering the perfect punch.

https://www.ndtv.com/entertainment/why-shah-rukh-khans-first-crush-mumtaz-refused-to-play-his-mother-on-screen-8311787,Why Shah Rukh Khan's First Crush Mumtaz Refused To Play His Mother On Screen,"Fri, 02 May 2025 14:59:33 +0530","Mumtaz was one of the reigning Bollywood actresses of the 1960s and 1970s. Recently in a conversation with Vickey Lalwani, the actress revealed why she would not agree to play Shah Rukh Khan's mother on screen.
Mumtaz spoke about her rule that to play someone's mother on the big screen, the age gap has to be of 20 years.
She said, ""I'll only play a mom to an actor who is 20 years younger than me, and that, too, provided I look good on screen.""
She further revealed how she got married at a very young age, and that appearances matter a lot for her at this juncture, when she is picking and choosing scripts she would like to be a part of.
On being further probed about why Mumtaz would not be ready to be Shah Rukh Khan's mother onscreen when veteran actresses like Jaya Bachchan have already done it, she said, ""That's Jaya's decision.""
She further added, ""Tell Shah Rukh I'll work with him if I can look like I actually do. But he'll say no. Why should I have grey hair? He's very intelligent, very smart, and a lovely person. Just because he likes me doesn't mean he'd cast me if I don't look the part.""
Mumtaz expressed her admiration for Hollywood legend Jane Fonda and her performance inMother-in-Law.
She said, ""Her character didn't want to accept a girl who was 'gareeb' (poor). She had the freedom to look and dress the way she wanted. That's something I'd like too.""
For the unversed, years ago, Shah Rukh Khan confessed at a press meet that his first two crushes were Mumtaz and Saira Banu, calling them the most beautiful women in the world.
Some of Mumtaz's most popular films includeBandhan, Aadmi Aur Insaan, Sachaa Jhutha, Khilona, Tere Mere Sapne, Hare Rama Hare Krishna, Chor Machaye Shor, Aap Ki Kasam, Roti, and Prem Kahani.

From Raashii Khanna and Vaani Kapoor, Kareena Kapoor Khan and Amrita Rao, Sonakshi Sinha and Huma Qureshi, to name a few, strong female friendships have been the new trend in the film industry for a while now.
Mouni Roy who is currently busy with the promotions of her upcoming filmBhootnii, was asked about her friendship with Disha Patani. The two have been spotted several times at dinners and luxurious holidays. They also hype each other up on social media and keep sharing several pictures.
Reacting to the same, Mouni Roy toldNews18, ""Two heroines can definitely be friends. It has got nothing to do with the profession that you're in. You could be a doctor, an engineer or a builder and still find friends. I truly believe that your vibe catches your tribe.""
She added, ""You're operating on a certain energy level and if you find somebody matching that same energy, you'll bond. It has got nothing to do with the profession. There's nothing like women friendship. Sisterhood is very important to me. Having a group of women who're your thick friends is like your entire family. You can find a mother, a father, a brother, and a sister in them.""
Mouni will be seen with Palak Tiwari inBhootnii. Earlier Palak had heaped praises on Mouni and how wonderful she is to work with, and the joy of having a good bond with female co-stars.
Reacting to the same, Mouni said, ""If there's any unpleasantry, a negative vibe or you not getting along with your female co-actor, it gets very difficult to work and say the dialogues with that person. And in that process, the honesty of the craft gets lost. I'm glad we met each other through the making of this project. We genuinely like each other and each other's company. We gave one another the space when necessary but at the same time, we could come together, sit down and joke around.""
Bhootniiwas released in theatres on May 1, 2025.

Kareena started her journey way back in 2000 withRefugee, and continues to be a relevant name in the film industry. In the current lieu of actresses, Kareena is still holding her fort.
The actress expressed her love for Bollywood at the WAVES Summit 2025 event, she attended earlier today.
She said, ""Main toh yahin hoon. I'm very happy with my Indian movies. It's so much fun to dance to our Hindi songs and deliver Hindi dialogues.""
She then went on to talk about the impact of Hindi Cinema, abroad, as she spoke about how she had once crossed paths with a driver abroad who was singing Raj Kapoor's iconic songMera Joota Hai Japani.
Kareena shared some gorgeous pictures on Instagram, showing a glimpse of her look for the event.
She captioned it, ""So honoured to be part of a panel discussion at the WAVES Summit, where India isn't just part of the global entertainment conversation, we're driving it. India is fast emerging as a superpower in the global entertainment industry and this is the beginning of a creative movement that will define the future (sic).""
Yesterday Aamir Khan too emphasized on the lack of theatres in India at the WAVES Summit 2025.
He said, ""I have always believed that we have very few theatres for the size of the country and the number of people living in India. In India, we have around 10,000 screens, and in the US, which is one-third of our population, they have 40,000 screens and China has 90,000 screens. And even in this, 10,000, half are in the South and half in the rest of the country. So, for a Hindi film, you have a maximum of 5,000 screens. Our biggest hits over the years, no matter what language, have had a theatrical footfall of three crore people. That's only 2 per cent of our entire population.""
As for Kareena, her last film wasSingham Againwith Ajay Devgn in 2024.
NDTV is at the inaugural edition of the Waves Summit, currently on at the Jio World Centre in Mumbai. The event brings together the who's who of showbiz, creators, and everyone who's anyone in the world of entertainment in India and beyond. Catch all updates on NDTV.com, from May 1 to May 4.

Days after his revelation,Aashiquiactor Anu Aggarwal claimed she also drank urine and got health benefits.
In an interaction with Instant Bollywood, Anu Aggarwal said, ""Many people don't know this... whether it's ignorance or just a lack of awareness, but drinking urine, which is referred to as Aamroli, is actually a mudra (gesture/practice) in Yoga. I've practiced it myself. I have tried it, and it's a very important practice. But one crucial thing to remember is that you don't drink the entire urine. Only a specific part of it is consumed... That portion is considered amrit (elixir). It's known to help with anti-aging, keeping your skin wrinkle-free... it's truly amazing not just for health, but overall well-being. I've personally experienced its benefits.""
When asked about the lack of scientific evidence behind such claim, Anu said, ""Kitni purani hai? (How old is science) 200 years. Yog 10,000 saal se hai, toh kiski baat aap sunenge? (And Yog is 10,000 years old, so who would you listen). I definitely support this.""
A post shared by Instant Bollywood (@instantbollywood)
For the unversed, Paresh Rawal shared that Ajay Devgn's father Veeru Devgn suggested him to drink urine to heal his knee injury faster during an interaction with The Lallantop.
""Veeru Devgan had come to visit when I was in Nanavati (hospital). When he got to know I was there, he came up to me and asked what happened to me? I told him about my leg injury,"" Paresh Rawal said.
""He told me to drink my own urine first thing in the morning. All fighters do this. You will never face any problem, just drink urine first thing in the morning. He told me not to consume alcohol, which I had stopped, mutton or tobacco. He told me to eat regular food and urine in the morning,"" Paresh Rawal recalled.
Paresh Rawal was slammed by Dr Cyriac Abby Philips, who goes by ""The Liver Doc"" on social media. He wrote, ""Please don't drink your urine (or others) because a Bollywood actor says so. There is no scientific evidence to support the idea that drinking urine provides any health benefits"".

The news of his demise was shared by actor Kishor Satya on social media.

Did he expect the performances to have such a lasting impact?
“Yeah, for me, it is really one of the finest performances of Mr. Bachchan. I mean, he just gave everything to the film. And while we were shooting it, I could see it because he was enjoying it so much. Every reading, every scene, every moment, he was taking so much time and joy to do it. He will not leave the set, he will be just there,"" said the director.
Sirar further added, “And some days he will come and do the shots again. No, he just wanted to give his best because he was enjoying it so much. I saw in his eyes, in his behavior, how he was enjoying.”
Shoojit highlighted the cine icon's brilliance in capturing everyday nuances, bringing authenticity, and charm to his character through small, natural moments.
He added, “He would pick up those moments, those small moments with the house help. He was just having a blast there. Telling the neighbour, just being angry at a neighbour who comments. He was just enjoying all that. So, the small things, the way he sits down, the way he eats his food, the way he talks in the dining hall, that is the real joy that is brought in. Absolutely mesmerized by his performance.”
Pikurevolves around an architect named Piku and her ageing but nagging father Bhaskor Banerjee, who come close via a road trip to Kolkata despite their disparate ideologies and fights over trivial issues.
The comedy drama, which is set to clock 10 years since its release, stars Amitabh Bachchan, Deepika Padukone and Irrfan Khan along with Moushumi Chatterjee, Jisshu Sengupta, and Raghubir Yadav.
Piku, which is slated to re-release on May 9, 2025, emphasises on the emotional and moral responsibility of adult children to care for their aging parents, highlighting the challenges of balancing personal life with caregiving.
Asked how he feels the story ofPikuholds relevance today, especially considering the growing number of young adults balancing their personal lives with caring for aging parents, Shoojit toldIANS, “Yeah, caregiving is a very important issue now in our topic. So, parental caregiving is a crisis also at this moment in this modern family structure, which is going on in the society. So this film speaks volumes about that, where you still, you can't just abandon your elders and parents.”
He added, “Piku takes that charge also. Piku says, I mean, you know, 'I cannot just, I'll have to keep them alive. I mean, if they are not, if we don't take care, they won't be alive anymore. So to keep them alive, I will have to be there.' Also when parents grow old, there is a very clear message there in the film that when they get old, they can't live on their own.”
He added, “You will have to be with them so that they can pass through, you know. So that's very important and relevant also in today's time. So, I think Piku, as a very progressive girl from a progressive family, is quite clear about that, which I think is very important to take away fromPiku.”

They feature his wife, actress Priyanka Chopra and daughter Malti Marie Jonas. From the possibility of a duet with PeeCee to Maltie's holistic upbringing, the singer-actor has spilled it all.
Nick Jonas recently appeared on SiriusXM's Andy Cohen Live podcast. He was accompanied by actress, singer  Adrienne Warre. The duo has worked together in the Broadway musicalThe Last Five Years.
During the conversation, the host wanted to know whether Nick Jonas was planning on collaborating with Priyanka Chopra for a song. To this, the actor had a befitting reply.
Nick Jonas said, “I don't know. She's an amazing singer and she's shooting a movie in India right now and she's travelling back and forth to the US. I think our best duet is probably our little girl. She's 3.
In another segment, Nick Jonas heaped praises on Priyanka Chopra for her unwavering support.  She's in nursery school, she's in karate class, got her first belt.”
He said, “Having a partner that's not only supportive of your ambition and your desire to do a good job, but genuinely just shows up and comes to cheer you is a dream scenario.”
Nick Jonas added that his wife also offered him suggestions to improve his performance inThe Last Five Years.
He said, “We talk a lot about work, and before Adrienne and I started rehearsing, I certainly was singing the music around the house and talking and probably pontificating for longer than I should have. But that's the beauty of this partnership and frankly, the thing I'm most grateful for about our marriage is the ability to share, kind of, life together and a humongous part of both of our lives is our work.”
Nick Jonas added, “It does naturally sort of become one thing, one mind, one thought. And so it's probably not framed as notes, but just like, ‘Here's some thoughts, let's workshop that a bit'.”

Things got so intense that Ashish Hemrajani, CEO and Founder of BookMyShow, was even summoned by the police.
Now, Ashish has finally opened up about the chaos during a panel discussion with NDTV at the World Audio Visual and Entertainment Summit. He was joined by Viraf Sarkari, Co-founder of Wizcraft International Entertainment and Vivien Lewit, Global Head of Artists at YouTube.
Addressing the issue,Ashish Hemrajanisaid, “There were a lot of things that were said during the booking phase about us. I think that is a little bit of maturity that is needed in the market. We are 1.4 billion Indians. It's a huge country. We had millions of people that were in the queue, trying to buy. In Bombay, it was 50,000 into threeshows– that is 150,000. In Ahmedabad, it was about 110,000 into two shows – that is 220,000 tickets.”
“So we are talking about 370,000 tickets. Now, you know, there was a lot that was said. The queue was transparent. The token numbers were transparent. We have every customer's email ID, mobile number, device ID, transaction ID, and home address because we deliver the tickets to your home,” he added.
Talking about the band's massive popularity and backing up the math behind the overwhelming ticket demand, Ashish Hemrajani said, “So the supply-demand — if you see the numbers on YouTube today, you see the numbers of streaming for a band like Coldplay. They are the world's biggest band. They are the highest-ticketed band.”
“We have a large population, which is now a discerning, young demographic, which has disposable income. Where does the math go wrong? It's just that somebody didn't look at it. The appetite is there. The math is very much there,” he concluded.
For the unversed, Coldplay had a total of five concerts in India between January 18 and 26. When the tickets went live on BookMyShow in September, millions of people flooded the platform, trying to book their spots. In no time, tickets were being resold on other sites at insanely inflated prices.
Although BookMyShow claimed it had no involvement in the black market and even filed a police complaint to support that, the Economic Offences Wing (EOW) of the Mumbai Police still summoned CEO Ashish Hemrajani to explain what went wrong.NDTV is at the inaugural edition of the Waves Summit, currently on at the Jio World Centre in Mumbai.

Addressing the WAVES 2025, Nagarjuna stated there is a reason why Allu Arjun'sPushpafranchise earned more in Hindi than Telugu, as the audience in the North was craving to see stars in a tentpole movie set-up, like the Sukumar directorial or Yash's blockbusterKGFseries.
""Both thePushpafilms made more money in the North than in Telugu. We have seen similar stories in Telugu before, likePushpa, which has larger-than-life heroes. Whereas in the North—in Bihar, UP, and Punjab—they wanted to see their heroes like Pushpa Raj, Yash inKGForBaahubali. They wanted to see larger-than-life heroes. For Indian people and culture, just living day to day is difficult, and when they want to overcome the stress by watching films, they want to see magic on screen,"" he said.
TheBangarrajuactress added, ""That's what the larger-than-life stories are doing, without losing the fundamentals of Indian storytelling. They are not going away from that, which is why they have been successful. Rajamouli shotBaahubaliframe to frame, thinking it is a Telugu film. He was very proud of his roots and language, and he shot it like a Telugu film, and people loved it across the world! If you are rooted in your storytelling, it will resonate.""
Nagarjuna said that Indian films have their own, unique storytelling DNA, which one must be proud of.
""You might say, 'A guy raises his fist and 20 people fall, it looks abnormal!' But if you likeMarvelorDCfilms, Superman does the same thing, but they give the logic of them having 'super powers.' But we don't need those special powers! The common man, the ticket-paying audience, including me, wants to watch my heroes larger-than-life. When I see Prabhas, Allu Arjun, and others going on screen and doing what they do, I clap and whistle"", theBrahmastraactor concluded.
Nagarjuna was speaking on the panel discussion 'Pan-Indian Cinema; Myth Or Momentum?,' where he was joined by actors Anupam Kher, Khusbhu, and Karthi.

But the ambition, according to key industry voices, must go beyond replicating old formulas. It requires identifying gaps, thinking hyper-locally, and scaling creatively for international relevance.
Speaking to NDTV's Editor-in-Chief, Sanjay Pugalia, on the second day of the World Audio Visual and Entertainment Summit (WAVES), Gaurav Gandhi, Vice President of Amazon Prime Video, reflected on the platform's eight-year journey in India.
He said, ""Our journey with Prime Video India has been over eight years. It's been amazing for us - full of learning and a lot of love from customers."" He added, ""When we started, we realised that to make an impact in India, you have to think local. As a market and as a country, we are so diverse that there's no single definition of 'local'. So, we had to think in multiple ways - local tastes, local languages, local milieu.""
This approach, he said, was rooted in identifying what the Indian ecosystem lacked. He shared, ""The first gap was the absence of high cinematic-value storytelling in India, which was already present internationally. The second gap was in movies - while we made a lot of them, there weren't enough theatres to screen them. The third was that everyone was locked into their own language. Keeping these three things in mind, we tried to bridge the gaps.""
Filmmaker Vikramaditya Motwane pointed out how the rise of streaming platforms has given creators the freedom they didn't have 10 to 15 years ago.
He stated, ""From where we were 10-15 years ago - when there was only one format and films were made only for the big screen - to now, the landscape has changed entirely,"" he said. ""Platforms like Prime Video and other streaming services have given creators the freedom to think beyond just a two-hour film in a theatre. Now you can make a crime series with multiple seasons and episodes. You can do a comedy series, something like Jubilee or Mumbai Diaries - there's so much freedom to tell stories.""
Motwane believes India is still in the early stages of this shift. He added, ""We're at a stage where filmmakers are discovering this freedom and just going for it. But I don't think we've reached the point where we've fully taken advantage of it yet. When that happens, the next step will be to create stories that not only work in India but also travel globally. That's when we'll truly enter the next generation of Indian storytelling,"" he said. ""Ten to fifteen years ago, people thought Indian content meant only Bollywood. That stereotype has broken, and over time, it will continue to break with different types of shows, films, and creators.""
Director Nikkhil Advani, who is currently busy with his upcoming revolutionaries, believes that historical storytelling must feel alive, not academic. ""Whenever you're working on something related to a historical period, the richer and more authentic the material, the better the starting point,"" he said. ""I did Rocket Boys, and now I'm working on Revolutionaries. It's always about the source material,"" he said.
Advani's approach is clear: entertain first, educate later. ""In the case of Revolutionaries, I'm having a lot of fun making it. The first thing I say is, 'Let's make revolutionaries sexy. Let's have fun with it.' Because if you give people a history lesson, their reaction is usually, 'nahi sunna hai, nahi dekhna hai' (don't want to listen, don't want to watch),"" he concluded.
According to the PMO, WAVES 2025 will host participants from over 90 countries, including more than 10,000 delegates, 1,000 creators, 300+ companies and 350+ startups.
The program features 42 plenary sessions, 39 breakout sessions, and 32 masterclasses covering broadcasting, infotainment, AVGC-XR, films and digital media.

Speaking to NDTV's Editor-in-Chief, Sanjay Pugalia, on the second day of the World Audio Visual and Entertainment Summit (WAVES), Aamir Khan highlighted the vast potential for collaboration between the two countries in cinema and creative content.
Aamir was on a panel named ""Indian Cinema, Oriental Look"" alongside Peter Ho Sun Chan, Stanley Tong and Prasad Shetty.
The spotlight was on Aamir, whose films - particularlyDangal(2016) - have seen phenomenal success in the Chinese market.
Offering insight into the emotional resonance between the two nations' audiences, Khan said, ""I've had the opportunity to visit China quite a few times over the last 6-10 years, and there's a lot I'd like to share. The audiences in China - their cultural sensibilities and emotional responses - are remarkably similar to those in India. From my experience, the way Chinese audiences reacted to my films, especiallyDangal, was almost identical to how Indian audiences responded. The emotions were universal.""
The actor went on to outline the creative and business opportunities such partnerships could bring. He shared, ""I truly believe there is immense potential here, for several reasons. First, India has a vibrant and dynamic creative community - and so does China. I've witnessed their events and films, and the quality of their work is truly world-class.""
He added, ""Whether from a creative, emotional, or business perspective, I think it's a win-win if we collaborate. Over the years, I've had many discussions with my friends from China about exploring these possibilities. Now, with initiatives like WAVES gaining momentum, this collaboration will likely get an even stronger push.""
""India and China are both ancient civilisations with rich histories and cultures. There's so much we can offer each other. I genuinely look forward to collaborating with creative talent from China,"" he concluded.
Aamir's statement comes at a time when India is aiming to position itself as a global content hub under the vision of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has repeatedly emphasised the importance of soft power in global diplomacy.
According to the PMO, WAVES 2025 will host participants from over 90 countries, including more than 10,000 delegates, 1,000 creators, 300+ companies and 350+ startups.

Let The Mayhem Begin,"Fri, 02 May 2025 16:32:48 +0530","After charming audiences with his role inWhen Life Gives You Tangerines, Park Bo Gum returns with a dramatic transformation in the action-packed JTBC seriesGood Boy.
The makers of the K-drama recently unveiled a teaser that hints at a thrilling mix of adrenaline, emotion and second chances as Olympic athletes trade gold medals for police badges.
The 50-second teaser kicks off on a triumphant note, spotlighting each character's athletic glory.
Park Bo Gum is introduced as boxing champion Yoon Dong Joo, Kim So Hyun stuns as a sharpshooting prodigy, and Lee Sang Yi's fencing finesse is on full display. Joined by Heo Sung Tae and Tae Won Suk, the team is a force of sporting excellence.
But the teaser quickly pivots. Gone are the cheers and confetti - instead, viewers are plunged into a world of broken dreams and odd jobs.
From a restless Dong Joo sitting alone in a rundown car to a mascot-suited discus thrower trudging through monotony, the visuals reflect the weight of dashed hopes.
As these former athletes are roped into a rookie cop program, their camaraderie begins to grow - and so does the danger. A shadowy villain from Inseong City looms large, pushing them to revive their long-dormant skills.
Dubbed the ""Goodvengers,"" this unlikely squad rises to meet the chaos head-on, with Park Bo Gum's defiant closing line - ""The round isn't over until we've taken down our opponent"" - delivering the perfect punch.
Directed by Shim Na Yeon and written by Lee Dae Il,Good Boypremieres May 31 at 10:40 p.m. KST on JTBC and globally on Prime Video.

Recently in a conversation with Vickey Lalwani, the actress revealed why she would not agree to play Shah Rukh Khan's mother on screen.
Mumtaz spoke about her rule that to play someone's mother on the big screen, the age gap has to be of 20 years.
She said, ""I'll only play a mom to an actor who is 20 years younger than me, and that, too, provided I look good on screen.""
She further revealed how she got married at a very young age, and that appearances matter a lot for her at this juncture, when she is picking and choosing scripts she would like to be a part of.
On being further probed about why Mumtaz would not be ready to be Shah Rukh Khan's mother onscreen when veteran actresses like Jaya Bachchan have already done it, she said, ""That's Jaya's decision.""
She further added, ""Tell Shah Rukh I'll work with him if I can look like I actually do. But he'll say no. Why should I have grey hair? He's very intelligent, very smart, and a lovely person. Just because he likes me doesn't mean he'd cast me if I don't look the part.""
Mumtaz expressed her admiration for Hollywood legend Jane Fonda and her performance inMother-in-Law.
She said, ""Her character didn't want to accept a girl who was 'gareeb' (poor). She had the freedom to look and dress the way she wanted. That's something I'd like too.""
For the unversed, years ago, Shah Rukh Khan confessed at a press meet that his first two crushes were Mumtaz and Saira Banu, calling them the most beautiful women in the world.
Some of Mumtaz's most popular films includeBandhan, Aadmi Aur Insaan, Sachaa Jhutha, Khilona, Tere Mere Sapne, Hare Rama Hare Krishna, Chor Machaye Shor, Aap Ki Kasam, Roti, and Prem Kahani.

From Raashii Khanna and Vaani Kapoor, Kareena Kapoor Khan and Amrita Rao, Sonakshi Sinha and Huma Qureshi, to name a few, strong female friendships have been the new trend in the film industry for a while now.
Mouni Roy who is currently busy with the promotions of her upcoming filmBhootnii, was asked about her friendship with Disha Patani. The two have been spotted several times at dinners and luxurious holidays. They also hype each other up on social media and keep sharing several pictures.
Reacting to the same, Mouni Roy toldNews18, ""Two heroines can definitely be friends. It has got nothing to do with the profession that you're in. You could be a doctor, an engineer or a builder and still find friends. I truly believe that your vibe catches your tribe.""
She added, ""You're operating on a certain energy level and if you find somebody matching that same energy, you'll bond. It has got nothing to do with the profession. There's nothing like women friendship. Sisterhood is very important to me. Having a group of women who're your thick friends is like your entire family. You can find a mother, a father, a brother, and a sister in them.""
Mouni will be seen with Palak Tiwari inBhootnii. Earlier Palak had heaped praises on Mouni and how wonderful she is to work with, and the joy of having a good bond with female co-stars.
Reacting to the same, Mouni said, ""If there's any unpleasantry, a negative vibe or you not getting along with your female co-actor, it gets very difficult to work and say the dialogues with that person. And in that process, the honesty of the craft gets lost. I'm glad we met each other through the making of this project. We genuinely like each other and each other's company. We gave one another the space when necessary but at the same time, we could come together, sit down and joke around.""
Bhootniiwas released in theatres on May 1, 2025.

Kareena started her journey way back in 2000 withRefugee, and continues to be a relevant name in the film industry. In the current lieu of actresses, Kareena is still holding her fort.
The actress expressed her love for Bollywood at the WAVES Summit 2025 event, she attended earlier today.
She said, ""Main toh yahin hoon. I'm very happy with my Indian movies. It's so much fun to dance to our Hindi songs and deliver Hindi dialogues.""
She then went on to talk about the impact of Hindi Cinema, abroad, as she spoke about how she had once crossed paths with a driver abroad who was singing Raj Kapoor's iconic songMera Joota Hai Japani.
Kareena shared some gorgeous pictures on Instagram, showing a glimpse of her look for the event.
She captioned it, ""So honoured to be part of a panel discussion at the WAVES Summit, where India isn't just part of the global entertainment conversation, we're driving it. India is fast emerging as a superpower in the global entertainment industry and this is the beginning of a creative movement that will define the future (sic).""
Yesterday Aamir Khan too emphasized on the lack of theatres in India at the WAVES Summit 2025.
He said, ""I have always believed that we have very few theatres for the size of the country and the number of people living in India. In India, we have around 10,000 screens, and in the US, which is one-third of our population, they have 40,000 screens and China has 90,000 screens. And even in this, 10,000, half are in the South and half in the rest of the country. So, for a Hindi film, you have a maximum of 5,000 screens. Our biggest hits over the years, no matter what language, have had a theatrical footfall of three crore people. That's only 2 per cent of our entire population.""

Days after his revelation,Aashiquiactor Anu Aggarwal claimed she also drank urine and got health benefits.
In an interaction with Instant Bollywood, Anu Aggarwal said, ""Many people don't know this... whether it's ignorance or just a lack of awareness, but drinking urine, which is referred to as Aamroli, is actually a mudra (gesture/practice) in Yoga. I've practiced it myself. I have tried it, and it's a very important practice. But one crucial thing to remember is that you don't drink the entire urine. Only a specific part of it is consumed... That portion is considered amrit (elixir). It's known to help with anti-aging, keeping your skin wrinkle-free... it's truly amazing not just for health, but overall well-being. I've personally experienced its benefits.""
When asked about the lack of scientific evidence behind such claim, Anu said, ""Kitni purani hai? (How old is science) 200 years. Yog 10,000 saal se hai, toh kiski baat aap sunenge? (And Yog is 10,000 years old, so who would you listen). I definitely support this.""
A post shared by Instant Bollywood (@instantbollywood)
For the unversed, Paresh Rawal shared that Ajay Devgn's father Veeru Devgn suggested him to drink urine to heal his knee injury faster during an interaction with The Lallantop.
""Veeru Devgan had come to visit when I was in Nanavati (hospital). When he got to know I was there, he came up to me and asked what happened to me? I told him about my leg injury,"" Paresh Rawal said.
""He told me to drink my own urine first thing in the morning. All fighters do this. You will never face any problem, just drink urine first thing in the morning. He told me not to consume alcohol, which I had stopped, mutton or tobacco. He told me to eat regular food and urine in the morning,"" Paresh Rawal recalled.
Paresh Rawal was slammed by Dr Cyriac Abby Philips, who goes by ""The Liver Doc"" on social media. He wrote, ""Please don't drink your urine (or others) because a Bollywood actor says so. There is no scientific evidence to support the idea that drinking urine provides any health benefits"".

Did he expect the performances to have such a lasting impact?
“Yeah, for me, it is really one of the finest performances of Mr. Bachchan. I mean, he just gave everything to the film. And while we were shooting it, I could see it because he was enjoying it so much. Every reading, every scene, every moment, he was taking so much time and joy to do it. He will not leave the set, he will be just there,"" said the director.
Sirar further added, “And some days he will come and do the shots again. No, he just wanted to give his best because he was enjoying it so much. I saw in his eyes, in his behavior, how he was enjoying.”
Shoojit highlighted the cine icon's brilliance in capturing everyday nuances, bringing authenticity, and charm to his character through small, natural moments.
He added, “He would pick up those moments, those small moments with the house help. He was just having a blast there. Telling the neighbour, just being angry at a neighbour who comments. He was just enjoying all that. So, the small things, the way he sits down, the way he eats his food, the way he talks in the dining hall, that is the real joy that is brought in. Absolutely mesmerized by his performance.”
Pikurevolves around an architect named Piku and her ageing but nagging father Bhaskor Banerjee, who come close via a road trip to Kolkata despite their disparate ideologies and fights over trivial issues.
The comedy drama, which is set to clock 10 years since its release, stars Amitabh Bachchan, Deepika Padukone and Irrfan Khan along with Moushumi Chatterjee, Jisshu Sengupta, and Raghubir Yadav.
Piku, which is slated to re-release on May 9, 2025, emphasises on the emotional and moral responsibility of adult children to care for their aging parents, highlighting the challenges of balancing personal life with caregiving.
Asked how he feels the story ofPikuholds relevance today, especially considering the growing number of young adults balancing their personal lives with caring for aging parents, Shoojit toldIANS, “Yeah, caregiving is a very important issue now in our topic. So, parental caregiving is a crisis also at this moment in this modern family structure, which is going on in the society. So this film speaks volumes about that, where you still, you can't just abandon your elders and parents.”
He added, “Piku takes that charge also. Piku says, I mean, you know, 'I cannot just, I'll have to keep them alive. I mean, if they are not, if we don't take care, they won't be alive anymore. So to keep them alive, I will have to be there.' Also when parents grow old, there is a very clear message there in the film that when they get old, they can't live on their own.”
He added, “You will have to be with them so that they can pass through, you know. So that's very important and relevant also in today's time. So, I think Piku, as a very progressive girl from a progressive family, is quite clear about that, which I think is very important to take away fromPiku.”

Believe it or not, veteran filmmakerShekhar Kapurrecently revealed that he no longer needs superstars like Amitabh Bachchan or Shah Rukh Khan for his films, because he plans to create his own characters and stars using Artificial Intelligence.
Speaking at WAVES 2025, Shekhar Kapursharedhis thoughts on how AI can create not just actors, but full-fledged stars.
Shekhar Kapoor said, ""Actors are going to be just actors,becauseAI will create stars going ahead. AI will create more human-like stars. And I can create a star using AI and have my copyright. And very soon there will be slew of ideas of AI movies that will have a girl or a boy or a man or a woman that I've created using AI, and that will be my copyright.""
Explaining why he doesn't feel the need for stars, Shekhar Kapur said, “In fact, now it's happening more and more. A lot of the influencers that you see are not humans. AI has created them. So why can't we have films with actors, characters who have become stars because we created them on AI?”
“I don't need Amitabh Bachchan. I'll create my own character. I don't need Shah Rukh Khan, I'll create my own character, my own star. And if I'm good enough, I'll create a character that the audience will love. And then I'll have my own star,"" he added.

Furthermore, he revealed, that their upcoming filmMahavatarwith Vicky Kaushal is the biggest film by their banner yet.
Dinesh said, ""I think we're in a very interesting space. Any example that you take of a region breaking out into the world first explores that region. I think, post-pandemic, we're finally getting our act together. We're understanding that stories need to be made for the common man.""
Dinesh also highlighted how the masses belonging to Metropolitan cities only head out to the theatres after the reviews are out. Unlike smaller areas, who are more keen to go watch a film on the big screen.
He added, ""The second step, when films do that kind of business in your market, is that you have the capital to expand. So, we are attempting to makeMahavatar, which is probably the largest film we've ever made. We want to make it... there is the technology available to make a world-class film.""
For the unversed,Mahavatarwas announced in November, last year and will have Vicky in the role of Chiranjeevi Parashurama. The film is slated to have a Christmas release in 2026. Vicky was last seen inChhaava.

Ground Zerocreated history by becoming the first film in 38 years to host a red-carpet premiere in Srinagar – a major milestone, especially since cinema halls in the city had shut down after the 1989 unrest.
Reflecting on the experience, Emraan Hashmi toldNDTV, “It was a huge cultural event. It was quite historic. After 38 years, who would have thought a certain air of normalcy would come back in Srinagar? It is a region that has been clouded by perception and goes from the past. When we went for our shoot in Srinagar, safety norms and the entire shooting went smoothly. We did not have any issues there.”
“We wanted to have an event for the jawans, for the officers, for some of the locals over there. There were just smiles on their faces of a certain normalcy, that has come back to the city, of having a red carpet event, having people from the Hindi film industry come there and showcase their film,” the actor added.
Ground Zero, directed by Tejas Prabha Vijay Deoskar, tells the courageous story of BSF officer Narendra Nath Dhar Dubey. The film follows his 2003 mission that led to the elimination of the notorious terrorist Rana Tahir Nadeem, widely known as Ghazi Baba.
Apart fromEmraan Hashmi,Ground Zeroalso features Sai Tamhankar, Zoya Hussain, Mukesh Tiwari, Deepak Parmesh, Lalit Prabhakar and Rockey Raina in pivotal roles.

The couple were first seen together in October 2023, dining at Via Carota in New York City's West Village. Since then, their relationship has steadily grown.
In a recent interview with Vogue, Gigi described their bond as a ""very romantic and happy dynamic."" She noted that while dating in the public eye has its challenges, the relationship works because both are clear about what they want.
""To find someone that is in a place in their life where they know what they want and deserve and you both do work separately to come together and be the best partner that you can be. I just feel really lucky,"" she said. ""I respect him so much as a creative, and I feel that he gives so much to me: encouragement and, just, belief,"" she added.

Bradley shares an 8-year-old daughter, Lea De Seine, with model Irina Shayk. Gigi, on the other hand, has a 4-year-old daughter, Khai, with singer Zayn Malik.

25 Indian tourists and a Nepalese citizen were killed in the deadliest terror attack in Pahalgam, Jammu and Kashmir on April 22. The terror attack ignited a renewed demand to ban Pakistani artists working in India.
Additionally, India downgraded diplomatic ties with Pakistan and announced a raft of measures, including the suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty of 1960 and the revocation of visa services for Pakistani nationals.
In retaliation, Pakistan suspended all trade with India, including through third countries. Pakistan rejected India's suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty and said any move to stop the flow of water will be seen as an ""act of war"".
Both countries have shut their airspaces for one another.

On Day 9, the action thriller collected ₹7 lakh through ticket counters, according toSacnilk.
In total, the film has earned ₹7.45 crore in the domestic market over nine days. The project's worldwide collection stands at ₹8.03 crore, the report added.
Ground Zerocreated history by becoming the first film in 38 years to host a red-carpet premiere in Srinagar – a major milestone, especially since cinema halls in the city had shut down after the 1989 unrest.
Reflecting on the experience, Emraan Hashmi toldNDTV, “It was a huge cultural event. It was quite historic. After 38 years, who would have thought a certain air of normalcy would come back in Srinagar? It is a region that has been clouded by perception and goes from the past. When we went for our shoot in Srinagar, safety norms and the entire shooting went smoothly. We did not have any issues there.”
“We wanted to have an event for the jawans, for the officers, for some of the locals over there. There were just smiles on their faces of a certain normalcy, that has come back to the city, of having a red carpet event, having people from the Hindi film industry come there and showcase their film,” the actor added.
Ground Zero, directed by Tejas Prabha Vijay Deoskar, tells the courageous story of BSF officer Narendra Nath Dhar Dubey. The film follows his 2003 mission that led to the elimination of the notorious terrorist Rana Tahir Nadeem, widely known as Ghazi Baba.
Apart fromEmraan Hashmi,Ground Zeroalso features Sai Tamhankar, Zoya Hussain, Mukesh Tiwari, Deepak Parmesh, Lalit Prabhakar and Rockey Raina in pivotal roles.

In a recent interview with Vogue, Gigi described their bond as a ""very romantic and happy dynamic."" She noted that while dating in the public eye has its challenges, the relationship works because both are clear about what they want.
""To find someone that is in a place in their life where they know what they want and deserve and you both do work separately to come together and be the best partner that you can be. I just feel really lucky,"" she said. ""I respect him so much as a creative, and I feel that he gives so much to me: encouragement and, just, belief,"" she added.

Now, the 'Omkara' actor has cleared the air around his remark saying that he had apologized for being evil in the film, and not for the film itself.
Setting the record straight, she said, “I apologized to Tim for being the evil villain in the film. I was growling and smashing everyone in sight! He said next time you should play the hero. I stand by all my films, and this one too.”
Saif was in conversation with his 'Jewel Thief', co-star Jaideep Ahlawat during a segment on Netflix India's YouTube channel, where he shared that his son was not impressed by ""Adipurush"".
Looking back at the experience, Saif revealed, “My son and I were watching the film recently, and I understood that it was bad. My son gave me a look as if to ask why he was being made to watch it, and I understood the situation. I quickly apologised to him.”
Saif essayed the role of Lankesh, a character based on Ravana in the retelling of the epic tale of Ramayana.
The project which also saw Prabhas and Kriti Sanon as the lead turned out to be a box office debacle with director Om Raut's directorial facing criticism for poor VFX, and mediocre dialogues.
Recently, speaking with Ted Sarandos, Co-CEO of Netflix during WAVES Summit 2025, Saif opened up about the kind of content he likes to watch the most.
He revealed, “I like historical films. Maybe films about other cultures, maybe Japanese. I am also very excited to see our culture on the big screens. The Mahabharata is the greatest story ever told, it's one of our great epics. I also like to watch massive war scenes, bringing life, history, and a past that is related to books. I would like to see that kind of atmosphere in movies. And I feel the long-form streaming format is just perfect for it.”

However, they are yet to arrive at a mutual consensus when it comes to their daughter's education, reports ‘People' magazine.
The ‘Dawson's Creek' alum, 46, and the Queen & Slim actress, 38, have agreed to the terms of their split, according to legal documents obtained by ‘People' though the couple has yet to agree on where their daughter, 4-year-old Juno, will be going to school. TMZ was first to report the news.
The couple has agreed that they'll use a mediator to plan a schedule for the 50-50 custody of their daughter, that Joshua will pay $2,787 in child support and that there will be no monthly spousal support, rather a lump sum.
In addition to the terms the couple has agreed on, Turner-Smith also claims, in other court documents, that Jackson has pushed back on a court order regarding her making the decision tied to where their daughter will go to school. Representatives for both Turner-Smith and Jackson did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
As per ‘People', in the declaration, Turner-Smith said that she and her former husband ""participated in a full-day mediation"" with a judge in May 2024 and resolved their ""temporary custody issues"" for their daughter's 2024-25 school year.
Following the judge's term with them, both Turner-Smith and Jackson later entered ""into a Stipulation and Order to resolve the issue of selection of Juno's school”, with Turner-Smith writing that it authorized her ""to make the final decision"" regarding their daughter's education.
She wrote in the document, ""As such, I have the clear authority to make the school selection in Juno's best interest, and Josh is refusing to adhere to the terms of the Stipulation and Order and is depriving me of the right to select the school”.

In her autobiographySach Kahun Toh, Neena opened up about the decision and how it changed her life.
She recalled feeling ""giddy with joy"" when she first found out about her pregnancy, but also felt it was important to inform Vivian. At the time, he had already returned home. After a long phone call, Neena shared that Vivian supported her decision to have the baby, which gave her the confidence to go ahead.
Neena first met Vivian at a dinner party hosted by the Maharani of Jaipur, shortly after watching him play. They connected instantly but lost touch when he returned home, as they hadn't exchanged contact details. They met again at the Delhi airport and soon began a relationship.
When she found out she was pregnant, Neena received mixed advice from those around her. Some suggested ""abortion"", while others warned about the challenges of single motherhood. But after considering everything, she decided to continue with the pregnancy.
She said, ""Vivian and I had an affair, and I got pregnant. Some people advised me to get an abortion. Others cautioned against the perils of being a single parent. I listened to everyone patiently. They were all very concerned, I know. But once I was back home and alone, I asked myself: What do you think? How does this make you feel? The answer was: I was giddy with joy.""
She continued, ""I also understood that I wasn't the only person who had a say in the situation. The baby's father, Vivian, had an equal right. So, I called him one day and spoke to him for a long tome,"" she wrote and added, ""'I'm pregnant', I told him. 'Would you have a problem if I were to have your baby?' Vivian sounded happy and said I should go ahead. This assured me that I was doing the right thing. As much as I wanted this child, I also did not want to go ahead if the father wasn't on board. So, it came as a relief when Vivian supported my decision.""
She said Vivian was ""as involved as possible"" after Masaba's birth. Their relationship continued for a few years, going through different phases. At the time, Vivian was already married, and their long-distance relationship had its ups and downs.
""Our relationship continued on and off for a few years and we had some beautiful moments and also some ugly ones. It was long distance and a very different kind of relationship,"" she concluded.
Neena raised Masaba as a single mother. Years later, she got married at 59 to Vivek Mehra, a chartered accountant.

An FIR was registered on Saturday after the comments sparked controversy.
The singer wrote, ""I have given unprecedented love to the language, the culture, the music, the musicians, the state, and the people not just when I am in Karnataka but anywhere else in the world. In fact, I have revered my Kannada songs way more than my songs in other languages including Hindi. There are 100s of videos circulating on social media as a testimony. I have more than an hour of Kannada songs that I prepare for every concert when in Karnataka.""
A post shared by Sonu Nigam (@sonunigamofficial)
He added, ""Their own people were embarrassed and were asking them to shut up. I told them very politely and lovingly the show has just started, it's my first song, and that I will not let them down, but they have to let me continue with the concert the way I have planned. Every artist has a song list prepared so the musicians and technicians are in sync. But they were hell-bent on creating a ruckus and threatening me wildly. Tell me who is at fault?""
""I leave it up to the sensible people of Karnataka to decide who is at fault here. I will accept your verdict gracefully"", Sonu Nigam concluded.
The incident took place during a show held on April 25-26 at East Point College of Engineering and Technology in Virgonagar, Bengaluru. During the performance, a young man allegedly insisted that Sonu sing in Kannada, leading to a heated exchange.
The singer responded, ""I have sung in different languages, including Kannada. Whenever I come to Karnataka, I come with a lot of love and respect. You all have treated me like family,"" the singer said.
""I always sing Kannada songs when requested. I have been singing in Kannada before that young man was born. But I didn't like the way he shouted 'Kannada, Kannada'. It is because of such behaviour that incidents like the Pahalgam attack happen,"" Sonu Nigam added.
The remarks drew criticism from several quarters, including Kannada film producer Karthik Gowda and activist SR Govindu.

The speculation gained momentum after Sobhita appeared at WAVES 2025 in Mumbai, wearing a saree that some believed was styled to conceal a baby bump. Her recent choice of loose-fitting outfits further fuelled the buzz.
However, a source close to the development has dismissed the rumours. Speaking to ETimes, the source said, ""She wore anti-fit, not maternity. It's amazing how a change in silhouette can birth a whole new storyline.""
The couple, who have kept their relationship largely private, first connected after an Instagram interaction led to conversations and a shared love for the Telugu language. They got engaged in Hyderabad on August 8, 2024, and married on December 4 at Annapurna Studios in the presence of close friends and family.
Their wedding came three years after Naga Chaitanya's separation from Samantha Ruth Prabhu, announced in October 2021.

It all started after Babil shared a video of himself and called Bollywood “rude.” The clip spread like a wildfire, generating mixed reactions.
Now,Babil Khanhas reacted to directorSai Rajesh's comment on the video.
In a now-deleted Instagram post, Sai criticised Babil and said that the actor should apologise to everyone.
In a screenshot of the (now-deleted) post shared on Reddit, Sai Rajesh's statement read, ""To Babil Khan's team. Do you really think we're that naive to just walk away silently? What kind of attitude are we being subjected to? It feels like only those whose names were mentioned in his video deserve respect — and the rest of us are just fools for standing by him all this while?”
“If you're making them feel valued just because he gave them a shoutout, and ignoring the rest of us — then yes, we do deserve an apology for how things have been handled. I genuinely wanted to stand by him even until an hour ago. But if you're taking us for granted, that stops here. These sympathy games won't work on us anymore. A sincere apology is the least you owe us. Say it, and let's move on,” he added.
In the comments section of Sai Rajesh's post, Babil Khan wrote, “You really broke my heart. After everything I've given to you. @satish_naidu1982 2 years of my life, complete physical atrocity to my body just so I can do justice to his character, I gave him my soul, rejected everything that came in my way for 2 years, anything and everything he needed, for 500 days of my life.""
""Not to mention, the pain and the suffering I put in my soul, lived in filth just to make sure sir @sairazesh is happy with the character. It's okay now. I'll let my work speak. Goodbye. Man, I had bugs in my beard because he needed that in the character. I gave him my laughter while I held back my tears. I slit my f****** wrist for him,” theactoradded.
For context, Babil Khan was reportedly part of the Hindi remake ofBaby, the 2023 Telugu film directed by Sai Rajesh. Interestingly, the remake is also said to be directed by Sai himself.
For the unversed, Babil Khan posted a video on Instagram on Sunday. In the video, a visibly emotional Babil is seen calling Bollywood “rude” and naming peers like Ananya Panday, Siddhant Chaturvedi, Arjun Kapoor, Shanaya Kapoor and others.
Babil Khan quickly deleted the post and even took down his Instagram for a while. Later, Babil issued an apology, saying he was trying to support everyone he mentioned.
Babil Khan is now back on Instagram, and interestingly, many of the people he named in the video are now showing support for the young actor after the backlash he faced.

Kapur, known for films such asMr India,theElizabethfranchise starring Cate Blanchett and ""What's Love Got to Do with It?, said over ""75% of box office"" of Hollywood films comes from outside the US.
""And significant part of the budget of those films are spent outside the US.

""This is a concerted effort by other Nations and, therefore, a National Security threat. It is, in addition to everything else, messaging and propaganda!"" he added in his post.

https://www.ndtv.com/entertainment/what-is-the-house-arrest-controversy-and-why-ajaz-khan-is-in-the-dock-8334505,"FromHouse ArrestTo Calls For Arrest, Why Ajaz Khan Is Internet's Most Hated","Mon, 05 May 2025 14:47:12 +0530","Former Bigg Boss contestant Ajaz Khan has found himself at the centre of yet another storm - this time as the host of a reality show that many are calling one of the ""most disturbing ever"" streamed in India.
The show in question,House Arrest, airs on the Ullu app, an OTT platform frequently criticised for pushing the boundaries of adult content. What began as a typical ""lock-in drama"" turned controversial when a viral clip from the show showed contestants engaging in acts that many online have described as ""degrading, inappropriate, and even exploitative"".
Khan, who has previously courted controversy over issues ranging from communal comments to alleged drug possession, is now being slammed for allegedly encouraging vulgar behaviour on screen. Here's a breakdown of what exactly happened and why it matters.
House Arrestis a reality show streaming on the Ullu app, known for its bold and provocative content. In a format reminiscent of Bigg Boss, contestants are locked inside a luxurious villa and subjected to various emotionally and physically demanding tasks.
The show promises intense drama, unexpected romances and explosive confrontations. Some of the participants include Aabha Paul, Humera Shaikh, Sarika Salunkhe, Muskaan Agarwal and Rahul Bhoj.
The controversy began when a viral clip fromHouse Arrestsurfaced online, triggering massive public outrage. In the video, a female contestant expressed that she lacked knowledge about sexual matters.
Instead of handling the moment with sensitivity, host Ajaz Khan allegedly encouraged other participants to demonstrate sexual positions on camera. The contestant appeared visibly uncomfortable, while other cast members reportedly clapped and booed as some of the women removed their undergarments. The episode has since been widely condemned for its exploitative and degrading tone.
Ajaz Khan, a former Bigg Boss contestant, hostsHouse Arrestand has called himself the ""daddy of the house."" Many argue that instead of maintaining boundaries and respecting participant consent, Khan turned the show into a space of spectacle and humiliation.
His role in directing the questionable scene and encouraging others to act it out has brought him under intense scrutiny, with many accusing him of legitimising vulgarity under the guise of entertainment. This incident has only added to the long list of controversies surrounding him.
Streaming platforms like Ullu and ALTBalaji have repeatedly been flagged for pushing the boundaries of acceptable content. While 18 other OTT platforms were banned by the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting in 2023 for explicit and pornographic content, Ullu and ALTBalaji were notably excluded.
ALT Balaji - founded by television producer Ekta Kapoor - has repeatedly faced backlash over its shows. From the erotic dramaXXXto controversial series likeGandii Baat, the platform has been accused of misrepresenting minors, glorifying incest and pushing soft porn under the guise of bold storytelling.
Legal complaints, especially involving season 6 ofGandii Baat, have led to serious charges under the IPC, IT Act and POCSO Act. Internet users have long pointed out that ALT Balaji's attempts to defend such content as 'women-centric' or 'progressive' often fall flat in the face of recurring themes that many deem exploitative and culturally insensitive.
Shiv Sena MP Priyanka Chaturvedi has questioned this selective censorship, stating that she has raised concerns in parliamentary committees with no clear response from authorities. BJP MP Nishikant Dubey has also assured that action will be taken.
The public response to theHouse Arrestclip was swift and fierce. Viewers labelled the episode as ""disturbing,"" ""degrading,"" and ""unwatchable.""
Many questioned how such shows get approved and are allowed to stream unchecked. One user on X (formerly Twitter) asked, ""How do they approve such TV Shows?"" while another pointed out the blurring line between entertainment and exploitation.
The outrage has amplified calls for stricter pre-release regulation of OTT content and increased accountability for streaming platforms.
India currently regulates OTT content through the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021. The framework includes a three-tier grievance redressal system and expects platforms to self-regulate.
However, the government is now working on new rules that will allow for content regulation before release. Under existing laws, platforms must categorise content by age suitability, ensure age-gating for mature material and comply with laws on obscenity and child protection, including the POCSO Act, the Indecent Representation of Women (Prohibition) Act and the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS), 2023.
Several other OTT series have also faced backlash for similar reasons. ALTBalaji'sGandii Baatlanded in legal trouble when it was accused of featuring obscene scenes involving minors. A case was filed under the POCSO Act and the IT Act.
Another ALTBalaji series,XXX Season 2, faced criticism for a storyline involving a woman's affair while her army husband was on duty, prompting outrage from military families.
Similarly, Netflix'sRana Naidushocked fans of actor Venkatesh with its explicit dialogues and was compared unfavourably toSacred GamesandMirzapur.
Ajaz Khan has been embroiled in multiple controversies over the years:

In a recent conversation with Puja Talwar on herYouTube channel,Nawazuddin called out the culture of sequels as ""pathetic"".
Talking about the trend of formulaic films, Nawazuddin Siddiqui said, ""In our industry, the same thing is repeated for five years straight - then, when people get bored, they finally let it go.

(Actually, insecurity has increased a lot. They feel that if a formula is working, they should keep milking it, overdo it. And what's even more pathetic is that now there are 2, 3, 4 sequels being made).""
Nawazuddin Siddiqui coined the term ""creativeruptcy"" to point out the creative emptiness of the industry. ""Kahin na kahin jaise bankruptcy hoti hai, vaise yeh creativeruptcy hogaya. Kangaliyat hai bohut zayada. Shuru se humari industry chor rahi hai. Humne gaane chori kiye, story chori ki(It's creative bankruptcy, just like financial bankruptcy. There's a lot of creative poverty. From the beginning, our industry has been stealing. We've stolen songs, we've stolen stories),"" he said.
Nawazuddin Siddiqui went on and added the tradition of ""copying"" has been in vogue for decades.
""Ab jo chor hote hain, voh kahan se creative ho sakte hain. Humne south se churaya, kabhi yahan se churaya, kabhi wahan se churaya. Even some cult-films which became hits, unke scenes bhi chori kare hue hain. Isko itna normalise kardiya gaya ki chori hai toh kya hua?(Now, how can thieves be creative? We've stolen from the South, sometimes from here, sometimes from there. Even some cult films that became hits have scenes that were copied. This has been so normalised that it's like - so what if it's stolen?).
""Earlier, they used to hand over a video and say, 'This is the film we want to make.' They'd watch that and just replicate it here,"" he added.
Nawazuddin Siddiqui pointed out that filmmakers, who wanted to make out-of-the-box films, were forced to quit.
""What can you expect from an industry like this? What kind of actors will come in? They'll be of the same kind. And then actors and directors start quitting - like Anurag Kashyap, who was bringing in good work,"" said the actor.
Earlier, Anurag Kashyap also vent out his frustration that the industry lacks ""creative stimulation"", which drives him to relocate to the South.

The film, featuring Vaani Kapoor, was supposed to release in India on May 9. Prakash Raj, who is always vocal about his ideas, now, has commented on the ban on the film in an interview withThe Lallantop.
""I'm not for any banning of films, whether it's right-wing or a propaganda film. Let people decide. People have the right. You can't ban films, unless it's pornography or about child abuse. But thought process? So what? Let them come, no,"" Prakash Raj added.
He went on to add, ""Today, anybody can get hurt. 'I'll cut the nose of Deepika Padukone! I'll behead her!' Useey kya hoga (what effect would that have)?. Shah Rukh Khan... just because of a colour? Besharam rang na... they can make a hue and cry about anything they want and the present power are letting that happen, to create a fear in the society.""
Prakash Raj referred to the controversies related to Sanjay Leela Bhansali'sPadmaavatand Shah Rukh Khan'sPathaan. Ahead of the release ofPadmaavat, an extremist outfit had called a ban on the film and threats were made to Deepika Padukone.
The second instance he referred to was the use of an orange bikini in the songBesharam Rangin Shah Rukh Khan'sPathaan.
After the Pahalgam attack, the Federation of Western India Cine Employees, an organisation of movie artists, pushed for the movie's boycott. The organisation had called for boycotting Pakistani artists, singers and technicians in the Indian film industry after the 2019 Pulwama terror attack, which claimed the lives of 35 paramilitary personnel.
Following the Pahalgam attack, this organisation renewed its directive. ""Despite the ongoing directive, we've been made aware of the recent collaboration with Pakistani actor Fawad Khan for the Hindi film, 'Abir Gulaal'. In light of the recent attack in Pahalgam, FWICE is once again compelled to issue a blanket boycott on all Pakistani artists, singers and technicians participating in any Indian film or entertainment projects. This includes performances or collaborations occurring anywhere in the world,"" the organisation said in a statement.
According to sources in the Information and Broadcasting ministry, several cinema halls were not ready to screen the film and several entertainment organisations had demanded its boycott. In the wake of the demands, the ministry had decided to put a stay on the film's release.

However, they are yet to arrive at a mutual consensus when it comes to their daughter's education, reports ‘People' magazine.
The ‘Dawson's Creek' alum, 46, and the Queen & Slim actress, 38, have agreed to the terms of their split, according to legal documents obtained by ‘People' though the couple has yet to agree on where their daughter, 4-year-old Juno, will be going to school. TMZ was first to report the news.
The couple has agreed that they'll use a mediator to plan a schedule for the 50-50 custody of their daughter, that Joshua will pay $2,787 in child support and that there will be no monthly spousal support, rather a lump sum.
In addition to the terms the couple has agreed on, Turner-Smith also claims, in other court documents, that Jackson has pushed back on a court order regarding her making the decision tied to where their daughter will go to school. Representatives for both Turner-Smith and Jackson did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
As per ‘People', in the declaration, Turner-Smith said that she and her former husband ""participated in a full-day mediation"" with a judge in May 2024 and resolved their ""temporary custody issues"" for their daughter's 2024-25 school year.
Following the judge's term with them, both Turner-Smith and Jackson later entered ""into a Stipulation and Order to resolve the issue of selection of Juno's school”, with Turner-Smith writing that it authorized her ""to make the final decision"" regarding their daughter's education.
She wrote in the document, ""As such, I have the clear authority to make the school selection in Juno's best interest, and Josh is refusing to adhere to the terms of the Stipulation and Order and is depriving me of the right to select the school”.

In her autobiographySach Kahun Toh, Neena opened up about the decision and how it changed her life.
She recalled feeling ""giddy with joy"" when she first found out about her pregnancy, but also felt it was important to inform Vivian. At the time, he had already returned home. After a long phone call, Neena shared that Vivian supported her decision to have the baby, which gave her the confidence to go ahead.
Neena first met Vivian at a dinner party hosted by the Maharani of Jaipur, shortly after watching him play. They connected instantly but lost touch when he returned home, as they hadn't exchanged contact details. They met again at the Delhi airport and soon began a relationship.
When she found out she was pregnant, Neena received mixed advice from those around her. Some suggested ""abortion"", while others warned about the challenges of single motherhood. But after considering everything, she decided to continue with the pregnancy.
She said, ""Vivian and I had an affair, and I got pregnant. Some people advised me to get an abortion. Others cautioned against the perils of being a single parent. I listened to everyone patiently. They were all very concerned, I know. But once I was back home and alone, I asked myself: What do you think? How does this make you feel? The answer was: I was giddy with joy.""
She continued, ""I also understood that I wasn't the only person who had a say in the situation. The baby's father, Vivian, had an equal right. So, I called him one day and spoke to him for a long tome,"" she wrote and added, ""'I'm pregnant', I told him. 'Would you have a problem if I were to have your baby?' Vivian sounded happy and said I should go ahead. This assured me that I was doing the right thing. As much as I wanted this child, I also did not want to go ahead if the father wasn't on board. So, it came as a relief when Vivian supported my decision.""
She said Vivian was ""as involved as possible"" after Masaba's birth. Their relationship continued for a few years, going through different phases. At the time, Vivian was already married, and their long-distance relationship had its ups and downs.
""Our relationship continued on and off for a few years and we had some beautiful moments and also some ugly ones. It was long distance and a very different kind of relationship,"" she concluded.
Neena raised Masaba as a single mother. Years later, she got married at 59 to Vivek Mehra, a chartered accountant.

In fact, I have revered my Kannada songs way more than my songs in other languages including Hindi. There are 100s of videos circulating on social media as a testimony. I have more than an hour of Kannada songs that I prepare for every concert when in Karnataka.""
A post shared by Sonu Nigam (@sonunigamofficial)
He added, ""Their own people were embarrassed and were asking them to shut up. I told them very politely and lovingly the show has just started, it's my first song, and that I will not let them down, but they have to let me continue with the concert the way I have planned. Every artist has a song list prepared so the musicians and technicians are in sync. But they were hell-bent on creating a ruckus and threatening me wildly. Tell me who is at fault?""
""I leave it up to the sensible people of Karnataka to decide who is at fault here. I will accept your verdict gracefully"", Sonu Nigam concluded.
The incident took place during a show held on April 25-26 at East Point College of Engineering and Technology in Virgonagar, Bengaluru. During the performance, a young man allegedly insisted that Sonu sing in Kannada, leading to a heated exchange.
The singer responded, ""I have sung in different languages, including Kannada. Whenever I come to Karnataka, I come with a lot of love and respect. You all have treated me like family,"" the singer said.
""I always sing Kannada songs when requested. I have been singing in Kannada before that young man was born. But I didn't like the way he shouted 'Kannada, Kannada'. It is because of such behaviour that incidents like the Pahalgam attack happen,"" Sonu Nigam added.
The remarks drew criticism from several quarters, including Kannada film producer Karthik Gowda and activist SR Govindu.

Here's What We Know,"Mon, 05 May 2025 15:56:36 +0530","Five months after their intimate Telugu-style wedding, rumours have begun circulating about a possible pregnancy for actors Sobhita Dhulipala and Naga Chaitanya.
The speculation gained momentum after Sobhita appeared at WAVES 2025 in Mumbai, wearing a saree that some believed was styled to conceal a baby bump. Her recent choice of loose-fitting outfits further fuelled the buzz.
However, a source close to the development has dismissed the rumours. Speaking to ETimes, the source said, ""She wore anti-fit, not maternity. It's amazing how a change in silhouette can birth a whole new storyline.""
The couple, who have kept their relationship largely private, first connected after an Instagram interaction led to conversations and a shared love for the Telugu language. They got engaged in Hyderabad on August 8, 2024, and married on December 4 at Annapurna Studios in the presence of close friends and family.
Their wedding came three years after Naga Chaitanya's separation from Samantha Ruth Prabhu, announced in October 2021.

It all started after Babil shared a video of himself and called Bollywood “rude.” The clip spread like a wildfire, generating mixed reactions.
Now,Babil Khanhas reacted to directorSai Rajesh's comment on the video.
In a now-deleted Instagram post, Sai criticised Babil and said that the actor should apologise to everyone.
In a screenshot of the (now-deleted) post shared on Reddit, Sai Rajesh's statement read, ""To Babil Khan's team. Do you really think we're that naive to just walk away silently? What kind of attitude are we being subjected to? It feels like only those whose names were mentioned in his video deserve respect — and the rest of us are just fools for standing by him all this while?”
“If you're making them feel valued just because he gave them a shoutout, and ignoring the rest of us — then yes, we do deserve an apology for how things have been handled. I genuinely wanted to stand by him even until an hour ago. But if you're taking us for granted, that stops here. These sympathy games won't work on us anymore. A sincere apology is the least you owe us. Say it, and let's move on,” he added.
In the comments section of Sai Rajesh's post, Babil Khan wrote, “You really broke my heart. After everything I've given to you. @satish_naidu1982 2 years of my life, complete physical atrocity to my body just so I can do justice to his character, I gave him my soul, rejected everything that came in my way for 2 years, anything and everything he needed, for 500 days of my life.""
""Not to mention, the pain and the suffering I put in my soul, lived in filth just to make sure sir @sairazesh is happy with the character. It's okay now. I'll let my work speak. Goodbye. Man, I had bugs in my beard because he needed that in the character. I gave him my laughter while I held back my tears. I slit my f****** wrist for him,” theactoradded.
For context, Babil Khan was reportedly part of the Hindi remake ofBaby, the 2023 Telugu film directed by Sai Rajesh. Interestingly, the remake is also said to be directed by Sai himself.
For the unversed, Babil Khan posted a video on Instagram on Sunday. In the video, a visibly emotional Babil is seen calling Bollywood “rude” and naming peers like Ananya Panday, Siddhant Chaturvedi, Arjun Kapoor, Shanaya Kapoor and others.
Babil Khan quickly deleted the post and even took down his Instagram for a while. Later, Babil issued an apology, saying he was trying to support everyone he mentioned.
Babil Khan is now back on Instagram, and interestingly, many of the people he named in the video are now showing support for the young actor after the backlash he faced.

In a post Sunday night on his Truth Social platform, Trump said he has authorised the Department of Commerce and the Office of the US Trade Representative to slap a 100 per cent tariff ""on any and all Movies coming into our Country that are produced in Foreign Lands"".
Kapur, known for films such asMr India,theElizabethfranchise starring Cate Blanchett and ""What's Love Got to Do with It?, said over ""75% of box office"" of Hollywood films comes from outside the US.
""And significant part of the budget of those films are spent outside the US. President Trump's imposition of 100% tarif on all films imported into the US may encourage Hollywood to move outside the US! Quite the opposite of what he intended. #Hollywood #tarrif #DonaldTrump #tarrifonfilm (sic)"" the director wrote on X.
Filmmaker Anurag Kashyap simply shared Trump's comments on his Instagram Stories without comment.
""The Movie Industry in America is DYING a very fast death,"" Trump wrote, complaining that other countries ""are offering all sorts of incentives to draw"" filmmakers and studios away from the US.
""This is a concerted effort by other Nations and, therefore, a National Security threat. It is, in addition to everything else, messaging and propaganda!"" he added in his post.

https://www.ndtv.com/entertainment/what-is-the-house-arrest-controversy-and-why-ajaz-khan-is-in-the-dock-8334505,"FromHouse ArrestTo Calls For Arrest, Why Ajaz Khan Is Internet's Most Hated","Mon, 05 May 2025 14:47:12 +0530","Former Bigg Boss contestant Ajaz Khan has found himself at the centre of yet another storm - this time as the host of a reality show that many are calling one of the ""most disturbing ever"" streamed in India.
The show in question,House Arrest, airs on the Ullu app, an OTT platform frequently criticised for pushing the boundaries of adult content. What began as a typical ""lock-in drama"" turned controversial when a viral clip from the show showed contestants engaging in acts that many online have described as ""degrading, inappropriate, and even exploitative"".
Khan, who has previously courted controversy over issues ranging from communal comments to alleged drug possession, is now being slammed for allegedly encouraging vulgar behaviour on screen. Here's a breakdown of what exactly happened and why it matters.
House Arrestis a reality show streaming on the Ullu app, known for its bold and provocative content. In a format reminiscent of Bigg Boss, contestants are locked inside a luxurious villa and subjected to various emotionally and physically demanding tasks.
The show promises intense drama, unexpected romances and explosive confrontations. Some of the participants include Aabha Paul, Humera Shaikh, Sarika Salunkhe, Muskaan Agarwal and Rahul Bhoj.
The controversy began when a viral clip fromHouse Arrestsurfaced online, triggering massive public outrage. In the video, a female contestant expressed that she lacked knowledge about sexual matters.
Instead of handling the moment with sensitivity, host Ajaz Khan allegedly encouraged other participants to demonstrate sexual positions on camera. The contestant appeared visibly uncomfortable, while other cast members reportedly clapped and booed as some of the women removed their undergarments. The episode has since been widely condemned for its exploitative and degrading tone.
Ajaz Khan, a former Bigg Boss contestant, hostsHouse Arrestand has called himself the ""daddy of the house."" Many argue that instead of maintaining boundaries and respecting participant consent, Khan turned the show into a space of spectacle and humiliation.
His role in directing the questionable scene and encouraging others to act it out has brought him under intense scrutiny, with many accusing him of legitimising vulgarity under the guise of entertainment. This incident has only added to the long list of controversies surrounding him.
Streaming platforms like Ullu and ALTBalaji have repeatedly been flagged for pushing the boundaries of acceptable content. While 18 other OTT platforms were banned by the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting in 2023 for explicit and pornographic content, Ullu and ALTBalaji were notably excluded.
ALT Balaji - founded by television producer Ekta Kapoor - has repeatedly faced backlash over its shows. From the erotic dramaXXXto controversial series likeGandii Baat, the platform has been accused of misrepresenting minors, glorifying incest and pushing soft porn under the guise of bold storytelling.
Legal complaints, especially involving season 6 ofGandii Baat, have led to serious charges under the IPC, IT Act and POCSO Act. Internet users have long pointed out that ALT Balaji's attempts to defend such content as 'women-centric' or 'progressive' often fall flat in the face of recurring themes that many deem exploitative and culturally insensitive.
Shiv Sena MP Priyanka Chaturvedi has questioned this selective censorship, stating that she has raised concerns in parliamentary committees with no clear response from authorities. BJP MP Nishikant Dubey has also assured that action will be taken.
The public response to theHouse Arrestclip was swift and fierce. Viewers labelled the episode as ""disturbing,"" ""degrading,"" and ""unwatchable.""
Many questioned how such shows get approved and are allowed to stream unchecked. One user on X (formerly Twitter) asked, ""How do they approve such TV Shows?"" while another pointed out the blurring line between entertainment and exploitation.
The outrage has amplified calls for stricter pre-release regulation of OTT content and increased accountability for streaming platforms.
India currently regulates OTT content through the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021. The framework includes a three-tier grievance redressal system and expects platforms to self-regulate.
However, the government is now working on new rules that will allow for content regulation before release. Under existing laws, platforms must categorise content by age suitability, ensure age-gating for mature material and comply with laws on obscenity and child protection, including the POCSO Act, the Indecent Representation of Women (Prohibition) Act and the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS), 2023.
Several other OTT series have also faced backlash for similar reasons. ALTBalaji'sGandii Baatlanded in legal trouble when it was accused of featuring obscene scenes involving minors. A case was filed under the POCSO Act and the IT Act.
Another ALTBalaji series,XXX Season 2, faced criticism for a storyline involving a woman's affair while her army husband was on duty, prompting outrage from military families.
Similarly, Netflix'sRana Naidushocked fans of actor Venkatesh with its explicit dialogues and was compared unfavourably toSacred GamesandMirzapur.
Ajaz Khan has been embroiled in multiple controversies over the years:

The industry, which has been going through a lull phase with big-ticket films falling flat at the box office one after another, has never prioritised originality, accused Nawazuddin Siddiqui. In a recent conversation with Puja Talwar on herYouTube channel,Nawazuddin called out the culture of sequels as ""pathetic"".
Talking about the trend of formulaic films, Nawazuddin Siddiqui said, ""In our industry, the same thing is repeated for five years straight - then, when people get bored, they finally let it go. Actually insecuritybohut badh gayi hai.Unko lagta hai ek formula chal raha hai toh usse chala lo, ghiso isko.Aur usse bhi pathetic yeh hogaya kiyeh 2, 3, 4 (sequels) hone lag gaya. (Actually, insecurity has increased a lot. They feel that if a formula is working, they should keep milking it, overdo it. And what's even more pathetic is that now there are 2, 3, 4 sequels being made).""
Nawazuddin Siddiqui coined the term ""creativeruptcy"" to point out the creative emptiness of the industry. ""Kahin na kahin jaise bankruptcy hoti hai, vaise yeh creativeruptcy hogaya. Kangaliyat hai bohut zayada. Shuru se humari industry chor rahi hai. Humne gaane chori kiye, story chori ki(It's creative bankruptcy, just like financial bankruptcy. There's a lot of creative poverty. From the beginning, our industry has been stealing. We've stolen songs, we've stolen stories),"" he said.
Nawazuddin Siddiqui went on and added the tradition of ""copying"" has been in vogue for decades.
""Ab jo chor hote hain, voh kahan se creative ho sakte hain. Humne south se churaya, kabhi yahan se churaya, kabhi wahan se churaya. Even some cult-films which became hits, unke scenes bhi chori kare hue hain. Isko itna normalise kardiya gaya ki chori hai toh kya hua?(Now, how can thieves be creative? We've stolen from the South, sometimes from here, sometimes from there. Even some cult films that became hits have scenes that were copied. This has been so normalised that it's like - so what if it's stolen?).
""Earlier, they used to hand over a video and say, 'This is the film we want to make.' They'd watch that and just replicate it here,"" he added.
Nawazuddin Siddiqui pointed out that filmmakers, who wanted to make out-of-the-box films, were forced to quit.
""What can you expect from an industry like this? What kind of actors will come in? They'll be of the same kind. And then actors and directors start quitting - like Anurag Kashyap, who was bringing in good work,"" said the actor.
Earlier, Anurag Kashyap also vent out his frustration that the industry lacks ""creative stimulation"", which drives him to relocate to the South.

The film, featuring Vaani Kapoor, was supposed to release in India on May 9. Prakash Raj, who is always vocal about his ideas, now, has commented on the ban on the film in an interview withThe Lallantop.
""I'm not for any banning of films, whether it's right-wing or a propaganda film. Let people decide. People have the right. You can't ban films, unless it's pornography or about child abuse. But thought process? So what? Let them come, no,"" Prakash Raj added.
He went on to add, ""Today, anybody can get hurt. 'I'll cut the nose of Deepika Padukone! I'll behead her!' Useey kya hoga (what effect would that have)?. Shah Rukh Khan... just because of a colour? Besharam rang na... they can make a hue and cry about anything they want and the present power are letting that happen, to create a fear in the society.""
Prakash Raj referred to the controversies related to Sanjay Leela Bhansali'sPadmaavatand Shah Rukh Khan'sPathaan. Ahead of the release ofPadmaavat, an extremist outfit had called a ban on the film and threats were made to Deepika Padukone.
The second instance he referred to was the use of an orange bikini in the songBesharam Rangin Shah Rukh Khan'sPathaan.
After the Pahalgam attack, the Federation of Western India Cine Employees, an organisation of movie artists, pushed for the movie's boycott. The organisation had called for boycotting Pakistani artists, singers and technicians in the Indian film industry after the 2019 Pulwama terror attack, which claimed the lives of 35 paramilitary personnel.
Following the Pahalgam attack, this organisation renewed its directive. ""Despite the ongoing directive, we've been made aware of the recent collaboration with Pakistani actor Fawad Khan for the Hindi film, 'Abir Gulaal'. In light of the recent attack in Pahalgam, FWICE is once again compelled to issue a blanket boycott on all Pakistani artists, singers and technicians participating in any Indian film or entertainment projects. This includes performances or collaborations occurring anywhere in the world,"" the organisation said in a statement.

An elated Ishita took to her social media account to share a beautiful anniversary wish for her husband, Vatsal.
The actress also shared a picture from her wedding ceremony and another picture from her recent vacation with Vatsal and her family.
Ishita wrote, ""Happy Anniversary, Vatty. Eight years, two beautiful babies… and a lifetime of love to go. Us, always and forever.”
For the uninitiated, Vatsal and Ishita met on the sets of the TV show 'Rishton Ka Sadaagar Baazigar' in 2016 and dated for about a year before getting married.
The couple tied the knot in November 2017, and they welcomed their first child, a son, in 2023 and their daughter in 2025.

Interestingly, Vatsal played Ajay Devgn's son in the movie 'Tarzan: The Wonder Car', which was released in 2004, while Ishita portrayed Ajay's daughter in 'Drishyam' in 2015.
Bollywood stars Kajol and Ajay were among the first guests to attend Ishita and Vatsal's wedding that took place in Mumbai.
Talking about Ishita, the actress recently marked her return to the silver screen with the sequel, 'De De Pyaar De 2'.
The movie marked her first release after becoming a mother of two kids -- son Vaayu and daughter Veda.
Ishita further revealed that she shot the romantic comedy while being pregnant with her daughter.
Earlier, she had taken to her social media account and shared a photo of herself posing next to a billboard of 'De De Pyaar De 2', which most likely looked like a cinema hall.
She wrote, ""Super excited for this one... My first film post both my kids; I was pregnant with Veda while filming this one. Being back after 4 years feels so strange, almost like a new beginning... Need all your blessings... Can I say I have forgotten how to pose? I have forgotten how to be me... To a new beginning (sic).""

From interesting travel tales to fond movie memories and thoughtful insights, the veteran actress is an open book when it comes to her social media posts.
Last year, she shared the story of how the late actor-filmmaker Raj Kapoor cast her as Rupa in the hit 1978 musical romanceSatyam Shivam Sundaram. Zeenat Aman describedSatyam Shivam Sundaramas ""a defining anecdote"" from her career. She wrote, “In December, we will mark the 100th birth anniversary of the extraordinary Raj Kapoor. I have rehashed the story of how he came to cast me as Rupa in Satyam Shivam Sundaram countless times, but here it is for Instagram. A defining anecdote from my career.”
A post shared by Zeenat Aman (@thezeenataman)
Zeenat Aman retraced her steps back to the 1982Raj Kapoor-led dramaVakil Babu. She said, “It was 1981, and we were shootingVakil Babu. Rajji (Raj Kapoor) was playing the titular role, while his younger brother Shashi Kapoor and I were playing leading roles as each other's love interests. In between takes, while the technicians changed sets and rigged lights, we cast members often found ourselves with time to kill. Now Rajji had a radical approach to his art, and he was brimming with enthusiasm for a film he wanted to make. For days he regaled us with his idea for a story about a man who falls in love with a woman's voice but can't quite reconcile himself to her appearance.”
Zeenat Aman added that Raj Kapoor “never once hinted” that she could be a part of the project. “He spoke with unfettered and rousing passion, but never once even hinted that I could be a part of this film. I was already a star in my own right, and his lack of interest in casting me began to chafe. I knew that my ‘modern image', complete with mini skirts and boots, was the culprit. So I determined to take matters into my own hands,” she said.
Revealing how she presented herself as Rupa in front of Raj Kapoor, Zeenat Aman continued, “I knew that Rajji spent much of his spare time at ‘The Cottage' set on the grounds of his sprawling R.K. Studio. It was here that he would hold meetings or host small events, often presiding over these gathering from a pristine mattress placed on the floor. So I made my move. One evening, having wrapped up early from the shoot, I spent an extra 30 minutes in my dressing room making myself up in my own interpretation of Rupa. I put on a ghagra choli, braided my hair with a parandi, and then stuck tissue paper onto my face with glue in an effort to scar my visage.”
“When I reached The Cottage I was greeted at the door by John, Rajji's right-hand man. He looked quizzically at me but followed my request - ‘Saabji ko kaho ki Rupa ayi hai',” signed off Zeenat Aman, before adding that she would be continuing the story the next day.

Zeenat Aman has appeared in movies likeDon, Hare Rama Hare Krishna, Yaadon Ki BaraatandDostana, Qurbani. She will next be seen in Faraz Arif Ansari'sBun Tikki.

Amitabh Bachchansaid, “We were just shopping around, and I happened to be looking at a tie, when the shopkeeper, with a dismissive tone, said it cost 120 pounds.”
The actor added, ""I looked right back at him and responded, ‘Pack ten of these for me.' It's moments like these that remind me of the importance of showing our Indian spirit and confidence, even when faced with condescension. We sometimes need to make it clear that we are not to be underestimated.”
In another promo shared by KBC makers,Amitabh Bachchan was seen talking about his college days.When a contestant asked if he visited girls' colleges such as Lady Shri Ram College (LSR), Gargi or Kamala Nehru College during his student life, the actor seemed to be avoiding the question.
He said, ""Dekhiye devi ji ki kya hai ki ab hum shadi-shuda ho gaye hai, aur nati-pota bhi ho gaye hai. Ab woh zamana jo tha wo jawani ka zamana tha, hai na? Uske bare mein aapko kya bataye? Abhi batane se humari poori pole khul jayegi. Aur yeh sarwajanik karyakaram hai, log thoda sa phir sochenge 'Acha aisa tha woh?'

People will pass comments about me).""

Here are a few films worth adding to your watchlist:
1.Sholay– Prime Video
Dharmendra as Veeru is one of hismost lovedroles. His comic timing in the water tank scene and his chemistry with Hema Malini give the film its lighter moments. Oh, and how can we forget his oh-so-famous dialogue, “Basanti, in kutto ke samne mat nachna”?
2.Chupke Chupke– Prime Video
This Hrishikesh Mukherjee comedy shows Dharmendra's playful side. His role as the botany professor pretending to be a driver is a treat to watch. Sharmila Tagore, Amitabh Bachchan and Jaya Bachchan are also part of the project.

She attended the prayer meet held at Hema Malini's residence on Thursday and said the family, friends and fans are all grieving deeply.
Looking back at her earliest interactions with Dharmendra, Sunita recalled performing with him on stage.
She said, ""I had performed with Dharam ji on Sony TV to 'Chalkaye Jaam'. I had shared the stage with him... it was so special for me. I respect him and his family a lot. I'm very close to Esha Deol too... my whole family is. We are big fans of Dharmendra ji.""
She added, ""In fact, I got married to Govinda because I felt he resembled Dharmendra. He is not that handsome; Dharmendra ji was the most handsome man in the industry. He was a true He Man of the industry and worked till the very last. He was a true desi, a largehearted man.""
She also met Dharmendra a few months ago during Ganesh Chaturthi celebrations. ""I met him two months earlier during Ganpati. I went with my son Yashvardhan. Esha had invited me for Ganpati. When Yash was born, I always wished that he had the qualities and looks of Amitabh Bachchan and Dharmendra.""

https://www.ndtv.com/entertainment/dhurandhar-major-mohit-sharmas-family-goes-to-delhi-high-court-against-release-of-the-ranveer-singh-film-9715789,Dhurandhar: Major Mohit Sharma's Family Goes To Delhi High Court Against Release Of The Ranveer Singh Film,"Fri, 28 Nov 2025 16:24:41 +0530","A week ahead of the release of Ranveer Singh's much-awaited filmDhurandhar,the family of Late Major Mohit Sharma—Ashoka Chakra and Sena Medal awardee—has gone to the Delhi High Court, seeking an immediate stay on the release and screening of the film. The family, in their petition, has alleged that the film heavily draws inspiration from Major Mohit Sharma's life, undercover mission, and martyrdom without the family's or the Indian Army's consent.
The family is being represented by advocates Roopenshu Pratap Singh and Manish Sharma of Samaanta Law Firm (SLF).
According to the petition, several elements shown in the Dhurandhar trailer and promotional material ""unmistakably mirror"" Major Sharma's military career, including counter-terrorism operations conducted in Kashmir.
Ever since the trailer was released, several media reports and online discussions have repeatedly drawn parallels between Ranveer's character and Major Mohit Sharma.
The family alleged that neither the makers acknowledged this association, nor did they consult the family during the making of the film or afterwards.
The plea emphasized that ""a martyr is not a commercial commodity"" and that his life cannot be recreated ""for profit, without truth, dignity, or due permission.""
The family argues that the film's unauthorized depiction infringes upon Major Sharma's posthumous personality rights under Article 21 of the Constitution. They further argue that it violates the family's right to privacy, dignity, and emotional well-being.
The petitioners assert thatDhurandharappears to portray sensitive military strategies, infiltration methods, and operational details without any indication that the filmmakers obtained clearance or script approval from the Indian Army's Additional Directorate General of Public Information (ADGPI).
The ADGPI is the authority that oversees how the Indian Army is represented in films and media. According to the petition, there is no evidence of such required permissions or consultations.
Filmmakers and government bodies are named as respondents.
Those named in the petition include the Union Ministry of Information & Broadcasting, Additional Directorate General of Public Information (ADGPI), director and co-producer Aditya Dhar, Jio Studios, producer Jyoti Deshpande.
The petition requests the Delhi High Court to halt the release ofDhurandharuntil Major Sharma's family is allowed to privately screen the film.
They further seek a declaration making it mandatory for filmmakers to obtain consent from the martyr's legal heirs and the Indian Army before creating or releasing any depiction of a real-life military hero.
The petition from Major Mohit Sharma's family comes after director Aditya Dhar clarified in an X post two days ago that the film is not based on him.
As online chatter about Ranveer Singh's character being inspired by Major Mohit Sharma gained momentum, Aditya Dhar wrote, ""Our film Dhurandhar is not based on the life of braveheart Major Mohit Sharma AC(P) SM. This is an official clarification.""
He further assured that any future attempt to depict the officer's story would be handled with utmost sensitivity and involvement of the family. ""I assure you, if we do make a biopic on Mohit sir in the future, we will do it with full consent and in complete consultation with the family, and in a way that truly honors his sacrifice for the nation and the legacy it has left for all of us,” he added.
Aditya Dhar's response was to a post by Madhur Sharma, brother of the late Major Mohit Sharma, asserting similarities between Ranveer's character and Sharma.
Dhurandhar, boasting a stellar cast featuring Ranveer Singh, Sanjay Dutt, R Madhavan, Akshay Khanna, and Arjun Rampal, will release in theatres on December 5.

The actor reminisced about their journey, sharing how the beloved 1997 hit remains special not just for its success, but for the bond it strengthened between him and Kajol. Taking to Instagram, Ajay shared a still from the film along with a wedding photo and a family picture. His caption read, “Jaise hua acha hi hua hai... #28YearsOfIshq.”
The first image carried the text “Ishq Hua,” the wedding photo featured “Kaise Hua,” and the final family picture showed the couple with their children with the words “Acha Hua.”

Ishq,directed by Indra Kumar, featured Aamir Khan, Ajay Devgn, Juhi Chawla and Kajol in lead roles. Dalip Tahil, Sadashiv Amrapurkar, Johnny Lever and Mohan Joshi appeared in supporting roles. Released on 28 November 1997, “Ishq” became a major box-office success, earning over Rs 500 million worldwide and finishing as the third highest-grossing Hindi film of the year.
In the film, Ajay Devgn was paired opposite Kajol, making their on-screen chemistry one of its key highlights.
For the unversed, Kajol and Ajay first first crossed paths on the sets of their 1995 filmHulchul, a project Kajol joined after the untimely passing of lead actress Divya Bharti. They went on to date for nearly four years, keeping their relationship away from the public eye. On February 24, 1999, they got married in an intimate ceremony at their Mumbai home, followed by a two-month honeymoon across Europe.
The couple welcomed their daughter, Nysa, on April 20, 2003. Seven years later, on September 13, 2010, they were blessed with their son, Yug.
During her appearance onNo Filter Nehain 2018, Kajol revealed that many people doubted whether her marriage to Ajay was a good idea and shared how she eventually convinced her father to support the decision. The actress had shared, “Nobody wanted us to get married besides his family and my family. My family also was iffy. My dad (late filmmaker Shomu Mukherjee) didn't talk to me for a week when I told him I wanted to get married. He was just like, ‘Why do you want to get married, you're so young and your career is doing so well,' and I was like, ‘But I want to get married!.”

https://www.ndtv.com/entertainment/tere-ishk-mein-review-a-love-story-so-bloated-even-dhanush-and-kriti-sanon-cant-salvage-it-2-stars-9715431,Tere Ishk MeinReview: A Love Story So Bloated Even Dhanush And Kriti Sanon Can't Salvage It,"Fri, 28 Nov 2025 15:29:29 +0530","Director Aanand L Rai's new film poses an old question: can love douse the flames that violence sparks? Its search for an answer takes it nowhere in particular.
But inevitably for a film dedicated to ""Mahadev and his Ganga"",Tere Ishk Meinmakes a brief stopover in the holy city of Benaras, where a priest-philosopher (Mohammed Zeeshan Ayyub in a special appearance) holds forth on love, death and salvation.
The lead actors, Dhanush and Kriti Sanon, playing characters named Shankar (God) and Mukti (salvation), do all that they can to convey intensity and passion, but the mess that they are called upon to sort out is too bloated to be wished away by their game efforts or washed away by the waters of the Ganga.
A large part of the trouble withTere Ishk Meinis that it is helmed by a man and written by two other men, Himanshu Sharma and Neeraj Yadav. They believe that they know the effect that hyper-masculine aggression can have on a woman who holds that men, at least some of them, are capable of redeeming themselves, no matter how much damage they cause in doing so.
The film hems and haws its way through a story of obsession that is thwarted by a mammoth class and temperament divide between a hot-headed Delhi University student leader who needs little provocation to resort to force and a senior bureaucrat's studious daughter working on a thesis on violence and how it is possible to curb it if one tries hard enough.
About 30 minutes in, it is as clear as daylight that the film's central premise is unconscionably contrived. Mukti Behniwaal (Kriti Sanon), faced with scepticism from her PhD guides who tell her in so many words that her line of thinking is fanciful, is bent upon proving her theory that violence-prone Alpha males can be reformed and turned into docile beings.
She talks Shankar Gurrukkul (Dhanush), the aforementioned belligerent guy who thinks nothing of beating people to pulp, into serving as a human guinea pig for her experiments aimed at substantiating her 2200-page submission.
Wonder of wonders, the man agrees to help out because she is a beautiful woman and Valentine's Day is around the corner. That is how outrageously 'inventive' the screenplay is: the Beauty not only tries to tame the Beast, but she also prods the ogre to get in touch with his softer side and give decency a chance. Pretty pat and fatuously facile.
Mukti insists that her 'relationship' with Shankar would be 'work' and nothing more. But the latter takes the frequent meetings very seriously until Mukti turns the tables on him after he insists that all work and no play can make Shankar a dull boy.
But when she does offer the guy an opportunity for some fun, he freezes and takes to his heels. But this is not where Tere Ishk Mein begins. It starts off in the air. Literally. And as the story unfolds, no matter how high it wants to fly, it never ceases to be airy-fairy, when it is not outright disconcerting.
When we first meet the male protagonist, he is Flight-lieutenant Shankar Gurrukkal, an irascible and overconfident fighter pilot averse to taking orders. He first flies too low and then too high. When he returns to terra firma after an unauthorised sortie, he is grounded for insubordination.
A counsellor is summoned to work with Shankar and rid him of his anger issues. The lady who is assigned to the task is Mukti Behniwaal. She is heavily pregnant, drunk and in no physical condition to take up the job.
But she does because, seven years ago in Delhi University, their paths had crossed and the one-sided affair had ended in disaster. The rest of the film, which darts back and forth between the Leh station of the Indian Air Force and the DU campus and its surroundings, is devoted to spelling out the whys and wherefores of the imbroglio that puts Muti beyond the reach of Shankar.
The things that transpire between Shankar and Mukti and between Shankar and Mukti's ill-mannered IAS officer-dad (Tota Roy Chowdhury) over a runtime of nearly three hours are difficult to digest given that the lady in the muddle is a qualified psychologist who should know better than pushing the man over the edge while letting him mess with her mind.
The encounters between the two are discomfiting, too, given the ease with which Shankar toys with Mukti, pushing her further and further into a corner. Why must a woman put up with a man who keeps trifling with her against her will even when she drops huge hints that her world and Shankar's are different and ne'er the twain shall meet.
There are points in the film when the boorish man is sought to be passed off as a victim (you've guessed it, there is childhood trauma lurking in the backdrop but it has nothing to do with his benign court notary-dad, played by Prakash Raj).
It gets worse when the weight of guilt is transferred to Mukti when Shankar needs another escape route. The gaslighting has an effect and the woman begins to question her own choices in the matter of her treatment of Shankar.
Tere Ishk Meinis the sort of movie where the negotiations between human beings is strictly via declamatory ultimatums. Shankar's boss, Group Captain Shekhawat (Vineet Kumar Singh), indulges in constant brinkmanship with his best but troubled pilot, so does Mukti's class-conscious father with a boy who will not take no for an answer.
As for the now-on, now-off relationship between Mukti and Shankar, it is always a case of clear threats being held out: alternating between ""you do this or else"" and ""I will do this only if you do that"". That is about the only way in which the circuitous and chaotic plot is attempted to be advanced.
This is ""an A.R. Rahman musical"". That's a small mercy. While the score works, little else in the film is music.Tere Ishk Meinis a love story that is an advertisement that love can do without.

He recounted how a routine walk to the officers' mess in Leh took a dramatic turn when a rifle was suddenly aimed at them. In his recent post on Instagram, Sanjay paid a heartfelt tribute to his late friend and co-star Dharmendra. He reminisced about their early days on the sets ofHaqeeqatin Leh in 1966, long before Dharmendra became a superstar.
Sanjay highlighted Dharmendra's mischievous, fun-loving personality that could light up even a freezing Ladakhi night. Sanjay also honoured Dharmendra's memory, noting that those who truly knew him will never forget him.
Sharing a throwback photo, the actor-producer wrote, “Long before the world knew him as a star, I knew Dharam as the young man who could turn a freezing Ladakhi night into pure mischief. We were in Leh in 1966, shooting Chetan Anand's Haqeeqat, when a simple walk back to the officers' mess ended with a rifle aimed at us and a sentry screaming in the dark.”
“Between our drunken bravado, a mountain of laughter, and that sudden brush with danger, a lifelong friendship took shape. Those who knew you will never forget you. Rest in peace my friend!”
A post shared by Sanjay Khan (@sanjaykhan03)
In the throwback image, Sanjay Khan and Dharmendra sit together while Salman Khan joins them for a memorable moment. The photo also features Sanjay's late wife, Zarine Khan, seated alongside them.
Haqeeqat featured Dharmendra, Balraj Sahni, Priya Rajvansh, Sudhir, Sanjay Khan and Vijay Anand in major roles. Set against the backdrop of the Battle of Rezang La in Ladakh, the film offered a fictionalized portrayal of the 5 JAT soldiers' heroics during the 1962 war and is celebrated as one of India's most iconic black-and-white war films.

Writer and director JK Chandru, who is known for his writing work in Vijay'sGreatest Of All Timesand Silambarasan'sMaanaadu, returns to direction a decade after his directorial debut,Naveena Saraswati Sabatham.
Revolver Rita,set in Pondicherry, we are introduced to Rita (Keerthy Suresh), an employee in a chicken fast food joint, who leads a simple but blissful middle class life with her mother Radhika Sarathkumar and two sisters (Gayatri Shan and Akshathaa Ajit).
Rita is a no-nonsense girl who has to ensure her younger sister clears the NEET to become a doctor and her married-to-a-drunkard sister makes a better life for herself and her young child. Rita's world turns topsy turvy during the birthday celebration of her niece in their small rental home when dreaded Pondicherry gangster, Dracula Pandian, barges inside their home brandishing a gun.
A shocked Rita and her mother confront him resulting in his death and total chaos ensues when her sisters also land up. Now, it's up to these four women to figure out what to do the corpse and ensure they escape the long arms of the law.
Enter Andhra don Reddy (Ajay Ghosh) who wants Pandian dead as revenge and he promptly puts out a hit on him through Martin and his men. Now, why does he want to kill him? Cut next to Dracula Pandian's sons.
A deadly Dracula Bobby, played by Sunil, and a comical younger brother Cheetah, played by Redin Kingsley, panic when their father doesn't return home the next day. The duo and their gang set off on a wild goose chase to nab their father's kidnappers/murderers while in Rita's home, it all falls on her shoulders to get rid of Pandian's body and steer her family to safety.
A family of innocent women caught in a horrific situation; a series of crimes, criminals and dons, and obviously, the police, lends itself beautifully to a dark comedy. The first half of the film introduces the various characters and sets up the background of Rita and her family and the issues they face given there is no 'man of the house'.
Rita's father dies by suicide when she was a child and her mother brings up the three girls by working in people's homes. We are made to understand Rita's emotional status and the motivations that push her towards the grey in a world where black and white didn't support them. The second half shifts gears and moves into more action, cat-and-mouse games and the plot of the film. The various characters come together to we connect the missing dots as the movie unfolds.
Director JK Chandru, who has proved his writing skills in numerous successful films, has craftedRevolver Ritawith all the elements of a dark comedy right from humour in tragedy (like Dracula Pandian's death) and Rita's moral ambiguity which is quite grey, to the absurd situations that arise (numerous gangsters double and triple-crossing one another) over the 145 minutes.
However, what lets downRevolver Ritais a poorly written screenplay that sees no novelty factor, emotional connect and repetitive gang fight action scenes (particularly in the second half) that slows down the film. There is no novelty factor as it has an oft-repeated theme of an underdog woman, starring in a women-centric drama, who wants payback for injustice.
The narrative has no freshness to keep the audience engaged and the linear progression, which has been infused with comedy via Redin Kingsley and Radhika Sarathkumar, doesn't really lift the film. The film rests solely on the shoulders of Rita but her character has not been really well-etched out either as it has no depth.
One is forced to compareRevolver Ritawith Nayanthara'sKolamaavu Kokila(which this movie reminds us of). InKolamaavu Kokila, there was a strong emotional quotient and Nayanthara's character arc was well-written so we see her grow from a timid woman to a strong one who threatens criminals. Kokila is also naturally funny because she does silly things that stem from her awkwardness.
One misses an arc like this with Rita and that's a let-down as the audience doesn't become invested in her or the other female characters and empathise with them. The sole emotional hook lies in the suicide of Rita's father and that backstory is not compelling enough either. Rita's sisters too don't have much to do in the film except scurrying around her like deer caught in headlights and the drunk brother-in-law (Shankar) was a character that could've been given a miss.
Having said that, there are flashes of brilliance that the director displays like the brief 1950s style Tamil cinema 'romantic' segment in the second half between Rita and a gangster; along with Radhika's sudden emotional outburst when she yells, ""Athai solarain, nee soodu!"" to a gangster (Your mother-in-law is telling you, shoot him).
One wishes there were more of these interspersed through the film to surprise the audience and elicit more laughs.Revolver Ritais very stylish in its making and visuals but the lack of inventive storytelling and the constant swerves between action, dark comedy and action, make it tough to enjoy the experience. Music director Sean Roldan deserves a mention as it's the BGM that helps elevate numerous scenes, some of which are mundane.
With regard to performances, Keerthy Suresh, Radhika Sarathkumar, Sunil and Redin Kingsley deliver their roles effortlessly and are ably supported by the others. Keerthy Suresh displays toughness and vulnerability in equal measure when required and her committed performance is to be appreciated.Revolver Ritawas a good shot for director JK Chandru to showcase his talent but the movie's uneven screenplay backfires for him unfortunately.

The movie was released in theatres on November 21 and starred Farhan Akhtar in the titular role.
Now, the actress has spoken her heart out in a recent interview with a media portal. She not only shared how Rekha reacted after watching120 Bahadurbut also shed light on a very important ongoing debate - the 'objectification' of women in South cinema.
Talking about the portrayal of women in the South industry, Raashii told Zoom, ""It is very important that I should be comfortable with what I am doing. If I feel like a line is being crossed and I might look cheap in it, I will say no to it. Every actor has a different comfort zone, and I don't judge.""
She further added, ""Coming to the projection of women, it is not just a South thing; I see it in the North quite a lot. It completely depends on the choice of the actor. Some people are comfortable with it, some are not. I have done so many commercial films in the South that I feel I should take that step forward in Hindi and get into content. I am okay doing commercial stuff, but I also have a limit. Every actor's limit is different, and that defines who they are.""

Here's What Rekha Told Raashii After Watching 120 Bahadur
Raashii also recalled Rekha's reaction after watching 120 Bahadur and said, ""Rekha ji had tears in her eyes when she saw 120 Bahadur. I asked her, 'Can I hug you?' She said, 'No, can I hug you?' She hugged me and told Farhan sir and I was there - she spoke about how my character touched her in the last scene and made her cry. She was quite emotional for a very long time. When someone like her says things like that, I feel I may have done something right. That is the kind of validation I seek from my peers and seniors, and also from the audience. I felt fulfilled that night.""

During a chat withFree Press Journal, Alisha said, ""To be honest, I was just bored with Bollywood music. I felt a little burnt out as an artist. I wanted to do something different. So, I stayed away, and there were other reasons as well, like all the politics going on.""

Apart from film music, Alisha has made a distinct name in the Indi-pop scene. Her albums Babydoll and Bombay Girl established her as a distinctive voice in the arena of pop music. But it was the success of Made in India in 1997 that made her a household name across India.

https://www.ndtv.com/entertainment/andhra-king-taluka-review-ram-pothineni-makes-a-strong-comeback-in-this-feel-good-drama-9715044,Andhra King TalukaReview: Ram Pothineni Makes A Strong Comeback In This Feel-Good Drama,"Fri, 28 Nov 2025 14:32:58 +0530","Indian movie stars thrive thanks to their ardent fans andAndhra King Taluka,starring Ram Pothineni, Upendra and Bhagyashri Borse, looks at exactly this fan culture, fan-star relationship and its impact on people's lives.
Sagar (Ram Pothineni) is a hardcore fan of 'Andhra King' Surya (Upendra) and will do anything for him. But to what extent will he go for his screen idol and the love of his life, Mahalakshmi (Bhagyashri Borse)?
Like what we see in real life in south India, Sagar, who hails from a small remote village called Godapalli Lanka (Godavari district), wants to catch superstar Surya Kumar's latest film in Mahalakshmi Theatre in the nearby town.
His father (Rao Ramesh) promises to take him if he excels in English and an excited Sagar holds his father to his promise. His bad luck, however, sees the movie running housefull and his father's plea to the fans' association head for two tickets has no impact.
The fans' head questions what they have done for the star and the 10-year-old hits upon a brilliant idea. He takes off his shirt to write something and scurries up the wooden ladder to put it up next to Surya Kumar's huge cut-out for the world to see - his shirt reads 'Andhra King Surya' giving the superstar a new name and Sagar instant fame.
As he grows older, Sagar engages in all that a fan does for his on-screen dol before every release - he sticks posters, puts up huge cut-outs, bursts firecrackers, does milkabhishekams(milk bath) for the cut-outs, throws torn tickets into the air, and whistles and screams louder than anyone at his hero's antics in each and every film. he eventually becomes the president of the Surya Kumar Fans's Aassociation in his area and the tag sticks on as that becomes his job as well.
Interestingly, even when he finds love, it is cinema that is a pain point as he's called 'nothing but a fan of Surya Kumar' and yet, it is also cinema that comes to his rescue.
On the other side, we see an aging superstar Surya, who is struggling to find a producer to finance his 100th film and who is possibly looking at the demise of his once illustrious career. When he tries to get a loan of Rs 3 crore from a financier, he is stunned to see the financier make a mockery out of the star who offers him a character role in his son's debut film.
Surya Kumar, a once celebrated hero, finds himself being relegated to the has-beens and it is an emotional blow for him. But someone deposits Rs 3 crore in his account. Who and why for the rest of the story. It is at this exact moment, we see Surya and Sagar connect - literally like the sun and the sea during sunset, and we are shown how it is a new sunrise for the two of them when the director takes us to the backstory of Sagar.
Andhra King Talukais a Bildungsroman story that showcases how a young boy from a small village called Godapalli Lanka, that has no electricity or economic opportunities, uses cinema to help himself and his village.
Like most hardcore star fans, Sagar lives, eats and breathes cinema and his thoughts, actions and dreams all revolve around and are shaped by cinema. P Mahesh Babu, who has written and directed the film, has made sure that he has included all the signature elements that fans indulge and engage in in south cinema (especially Tamil and Telugu) but he has deftly refrained from turning the story into a psychological analysis or negative inspection of the star-fan relationship.
The director has also ensured that he showcases the other side - the realities an ageing superstar faces and how vulnerable the star becomes once their light starts to fade. Age is not kind to those on screen and as much as they try to be relevant and hold on to their fame, it can slip away easily as time goes.
The story is emotional, endearing and tells us how someone who is a nobody to a star can have a massive impact on his life and vice versa. The entire film revolves around a star, a fan, a theatre, a theatre owner and his daughter. Sagar's world is small and confined to cinema but it is also larger-than-life as it resembles a movie in itself. But the storyline mixes rural politics, personal loyalty, and the clash between tradition and modern aspirations of those in the village.
Unlike those who believe that fans and fanatical behaviour can destroy society, Mahesh Babu has shown the positive side of this which is uplifting and heart-warming. The storyline of the film is predictable and the film does have some lags, particularly in the middle portions.
Mahalakshmi's character could have had more depth as well. The editing needed to have been tighter but it is engaging for the most part thanks to earnest performances by the cast. The songs by Vivek and Mervin are par for the course with perfunctory numbers for the front benchers and the romantics.
Ram Pothineni, who has had several bad films in the last few years, is back in the reckoning withAndhra King Talukawith his solid (but sometimes over-the-top) performance as Sagar. The actor is relatable, energetic and charming, with impactful dramatic moments ensuring mass appeal.
Kannada star Upendra essays superstar Surya Kumar with ease and his layered performance as a star losing his shine stands out as he displays vulnerability and wisdom.
Rahul Ramakrishna as Sagar's friend has superb timing with his dialogue delivery which elicits laughs, while Bhagyashri Borse is on a roll with a top-notch performance here too, likeKaantha. She displays grace and sincerity in the role of Maheshwari and the chemistry between her and Ram Pothineni, particularly in some of the scenes in the second half, is very natural and endearing. On the whole,Andhra King Talukais a strong comeback for Ram Pothineni and another win for Bhagyashri Borse.
