https://www.ndtv.com/education/3-idiots-fame-ladakh-school-gets-cbse-affiliation-over-two-decades-after-its-inception-8274041,'3 Idiots' Fame Ladakh School Gets CBSE Affiliation Over Two Decades After Its Inception,"Apr 28, 2025 08:57 am IST","Druk Padma Karpo School, nestled in the cold desert of Ladakh and popularly known as ""Rancho's school"", has finally got CBSE affiliation more than two decades after it was founded. The affiliation was granted after several delays and rejections.
The school, which shot to fame after it featured in the Aamir Khan-starrer movie ""3 Idiots"" in 2009, was so far affiliated with the Jammu and Kashmir State Board of School Education (JKBOSE). Known for its innovative methods of teaching much before the new National Education Policy (NEP) proposed reforms to move away from traditional ""rot learning"", the school is now planning to expand till class 12.
""We have finally got the CBSE affiliation after delay of several years and our first batch of class 10 students is now waiting for their CBSE board exam results.
""Though we had all the required infrastructure in place, excellent result record and focus on innovative ways of teaching and learning, we didn't get the NOC from the JKBOSE despite several attempts all these years,"" school principal Mingur Angmo told PTI.
As per the affiliation norms of the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE), schools require a 'no objection certificate' from the respective state board. The foreign schools require a similar document from the embassy concerned or the Consulate of India in the country concerned.
The school has been trying to get the clearance since even before Ladakh acquired the Union Territory status.
""The infrastructure is already being expanded and we plan to start class 11 and 12 by 2028. We are conducting some training for our teachers to facilitate a smooth transition for students to the CBSE curriculum. Our methods of teaching were different from traditional classroom teaching and with the CBSE also reforming its pedagogy after the NEP, it will be easier for us to blend both,"" Angmo explained.
Even after the bifurcation, several schools in Ladakh continue to be affiliated to the Jammu and Kashmir board.
A committee had also proposed establishment of a new territorial board in Ladakh with an aim to fulfil the ""realistic needs of the students as per the natural conditions of the region"".

The 24-year-old school is named after Mipham Pema Karpo (1527-1592), who is revered as a great scholar, while Padma Karpo means 'White Lotus' in Bothi, the local language.
The school is now flocked by tourists, making it a 'must go' point on the itinerary. A wall of the school's building featured in the closing scene of the Bollywood film in which one of the characters, Chatur, tries to urinate but gets an electric shock as two kids throw at him a light bulb connected with wire from the first floor's window.
While the 'iconic idiotic wall' - part of a building which was damaged in the 2010 flash floods - still remains on campus, the first floor, earlier made of bricks, has been replaced with wooden structures typically used in Ladakh.
The school decided in 2018 to relocate the 'Rancho's wall' to ensure students don't get distracted due to inflow of tourists.
""Now the two areas are separate, the students do not get disturbed by the tourists. However, at times tourists get to attend some activities ongoing at the school. Like yesterday, we had conducted mock elections with the election commission here. The activity was done to give students a first-hand experience of the democratic process right from voting to the forming of a government.
""So, if there is such an activity going on, we sometimes allow visitors to attend or see,"" Angmo explained.
""With CBSE affiliation, the transition for higher education in the country and abroad will be easier for our students and we can set an example of blending traditional classroom learning with innovative and play-way methods of teaching,"" she added. PTI GJS GJS MNK MNK

According to the Chief Education Officer (CEO), Rajouri, the decision was taken as a precautionary measure in response to the call for a shutdown, which was called by various associations and political parties in solidarity with the victims and condemnation of the Pahalgam terror attack, which claimed the lives of innocent tourists.

Meanwhile, as the nation comes to terms with the devastating loss, political parties as well as traders' unions in the region today have collectively called for a complete shutdown in the Kashmir valley in solidarity with the victims' families and condemnation of the attack.
Speaking to ANI on the complete shutdown in the valley, Bashir Ahmad Kongposh, General Secretary of the Kashmir Traders and Manufacturers Association, said that the complete shutdown was to show a strong condemnation and protest against the Pahalgam terror attack.
""Following the heart-wrenching incident that happened yesterday, the Kashmir traders and manufacturers association will be in complete shutdown today. We have protested against it and condemn this act as strongly as possible. Islam doesn't allow such things where people get killed... It is the death of humanity... We are really against these acts... Yesterday we had a meeting on the shutdown... We also want to keep these acts away from the region... In solidarity, we have called for a total shutdown in response to the attack,"" Kongposh said.
Business communities in Poonch also held protests, calling for a complete shutdown in response to the terror attack on Tuesday.

According to a report by the American Immigration Lawyers Association (AILA), about half of the 327 recent visa revocations collected by the organisation have been of Indian students. The AILA brief, titled 'The Scope of Immigration Enforcement Actions Against International Students', highlights that 50 per cent of these students were from India, followed by 14 per cent from China. Other countries represented in the data include South Korea, Nepal, and Bangladesh.
The US State Department and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) have been screening foreign students' data, including their activism, over the past four months. Some allege that this screening is done usingartificial intelligence, which may lead to inaccurate targeting of students without a criminal history or links to campus protests. In March, Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced the ""Catch and Revoke"" program to identify and screen student visa holders, including monitoring their social media for evidence of anti-Semitism or support for Palestinians and Hamas.

The Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) is a portal used by the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to track international students and exchange program visitors. According to an ICE release, the visa status of 4,736 international students was terminated in the SEVIS system, mostly holding F1 visas. AILA described these administrative actions as unprecedented, raising several legal questions that may require litigation.
The impact of these visa revocations is significant, with 50 per cent of the 327 cases being Optional Practical Training (OPT) holders. OPT allows international students on F-1 visas to work in the US for up to 12 months. With their visas revoked, these students are now unable to work. The top states affected by these visa revocations are Texas, California, New York, Michigan, and Arizona.
However, its worthwhile to note that, around 1,000 international students at U.S. colleges, universities and university systems have had their visas revoked or their legal status terminated since late March, according to an Associated Press review of university statements and correspondence with school officials.
Many of the students losing their legal status are from India and China, which together account for more than half the international students at American colleges. But the terminations have not been limited to those from any one part of the world, lawyers said.
The Indian government has taken notice of the issue. Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal stated, ""We are aware that several Indian students have received communication from the US government regarding their F-1 visa status. We are looking into the matter. Our Embassy and consulate are in touch with the students.""",2025-05-03 05:01:14,Positive

""It is a public narrative that can influence how anyone could perceive purpose of travel and mid-to-long-term goals.

Meanwhile, Class 10 students face a different kind of pressure: Stream selection. A good result opens the door to coveted streams like Science or Commerce, setting the tone for next two years of study.
Once the CBSE Class 10 and 12 results are declared, students will be able to check their scorecards on the board's official websites. The results will also be available on DigiLocker and the UMANG app.

https://www.ndtv.com/education/3-idiots-fame-ladakh-school-gets-cbse-affiliation-over-two-decades-after-its-inception-8274041,'3 Idiots' Fame Ladakh School Gets CBSE Affiliation Over Two Decades After Its Inception,"Apr 28, 2025 08:57 am IST","Druk Padma Karpo School, nestled in the cold desert of Ladakh and popularly known as ""Rancho's school"", has finally got CBSE affiliation more than two decades after it was founded. The affiliation was granted after several delays and rejections.
The school, which shot to fame after it featured in the Aamir Khan-starrer movie ""3 Idiots"" in 2009, was so far affiliated with the Jammu and Kashmir State Board of School Education (JKBOSE). Known for its innovative methods of teaching much before the new National Education Policy (NEP) proposed reforms to move away from traditional ""rot learning"", the school is now planning to expand till class 12.
""We have finally got the CBSE affiliation after delay of several years and our first batch of class 10 students is now waiting for their CBSE board exam results.
""Though we had all the required infrastructure in place, excellent result record and focus on innovative ways of teaching and learning, we didn't get the NOC from the JKBOSE despite several attempts all these years,"" school principal Mingur Angmo told PTI.
As per the affiliation norms of the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE), schools require a 'no objection certificate' from the respective state board. The foreign schools require a similar document from the embassy concerned or the Consulate of India in the country concerned.
The school has been trying to get the clearance since even before Ladakh acquired the Union Territory status.
""The infrastructure is already being expanded and we plan to start class 11 and 12 by 2028. We are conducting some training for our teachers to facilitate a smooth transition for students to the CBSE curriculum. Our methods of teaching were different from traditional classroom teaching and with the CBSE also reforming its pedagogy after the NEP, it will be easier for us to blend both,"" Angmo explained.
Even after the bifurcation, several schools in Ladakh continue to be affiliated to the Jammu and Kashmir board.
A committee had also proposed establishment of a new territorial board in Ladakh with an aim to fulfil the ""realistic needs of the students as per the natural conditions of the region"".

The 24-year-old school is named after Mipham Pema Karpo (1527-1592), who is revered as a great scholar, while Padma Karpo means 'White Lotus' in Bothi, the local language.
The school is now flocked by tourists, making it a 'must go' point on the itinerary. A wall of the school's building featured in the closing scene of the Bollywood film in which one of the characters, Chatur, tries to urinate but gets an electric shock as two kids throw at him a light bulb connected with wire from the first floor's window.
While the 'iconic idiotic wall' - part of a building which was damaged in the 2010 flash floods - still remains on campus, the first floor, earlier made of bricks, has been replaced with wooden structures typically used in Ladakh.
The school decided in 2018 to relocate the 'Rancho's wall' to ensure students don't get distracted due to inflow of tourists.
""Now the two areas are separate, the students do not get disturbed by the tourists. However, at times tourists get to attend some activities ongoing at the school. Like yesterday, we had conducted mock elections with the election commission here. The activity was done to give students a first-hand experience of the democratic process right from voting to the forming of a government.
""So, if there is such an activity going on, we sometimes allow visitors to attend or see,"" Angmo explained.
""With CBSE affiliation, the transition for higher education in the country and abroad will be easier for our students and we can set an example of blending traditional classroom learning with innovative and play-way methods of teaching,"" she added. PTI GJS GJS MNK MNK

Meanwhile, as the nation comes to terms with the devastating loss, political parties as well as traders' unions in the region today have collectively called for a complete shutdown in the Kashmir valley in solidarity with the victims' families and condemnation of the attack.
Speaking to ANI on the complete shutdown in the valley, Bashir Ahmad Kongposh, General Secretary of the Kashmir Traders and Manufacturers Association, said that the complete shutdown was to show a strong condemnation and protest against the Pahalgam terror attack.
""Following the heart-wrenching incident that happened yesterday, the Kashmir traders and manufacturers association will be in complete shutdown today. We have protested against it and condemn this act as strongly as possible. Islam doesn't allow such things where people get killed... It is the death of humanity... We are really against these acts... Yesterday we had a meeting on the shutdown... We also want to keep these acts away from the region... In solidarity, we have called for a total shutdown in response to the attack,"" Kongposh said.
Business communities in Poonch also held protests, calling for a complete shutdown in response to the terror attack on Tuesday.
Earlier on Tuesday, several political parties in Jammu and Kashmir extended their support to the call for a Kashmir Bandh (shutdown) on Wednesday to condemn the Pahalgam terror attack and show solidarity with the victims' families.
Jammu and Kashmir National Conference (JKNC) has appealed to the people to make the Bandh a ""complete success"" and condemn the attack.
In a social media post on X, JKNC wrote, ""On the instruction of the Party President, JKNC joins the collective call for a bandh in strong condemnation of the Pahalgam terror attack. We appeal to the people of J&K to ensure the hartal called by religious and social leaders is a complete success.""
Jammu and Kashmir Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) chief Mehbooba Mufti has expressed solidarity with the victims' families and supported the shutdown, calling it an ""attack on all of us"".
Jammu-Kashmir Students Association (JKSA) has termed the attack an ""assault on the very soul of Jammu and Kashmir"" and has also extended its support to the Bandh.
All Parties Hurriyat Conference Chairman Mirwaiz Umar Farooq urged the people of Jammu and Kashmir to support the shutdown and peacefully protest against the ""heinous crime"".

According to a report by the American Immigration Lawyers Association (AILA), about half of the 327 recent visa revocations collected by the organisation have been of Indian students. The AILA brief, titled 'The Scope of Immigration Enforcement Actions Against International Students', highlights that 50 per cent of these students were from India, followed by 14 per cent from China. Other countries represented in the data include South Korea, Nepal, and Bangladesh.
The US State Department and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) have been screening foreign students' data, including their activism, over the past four months. Some allege that this screening is done usingartificial intelligence, which may lead to inaccurate targeting of students without a criminal history or links to campus protests. In March, Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced the ""Catch and Revoke"" program to identify and screen student visa holders, including monitoring their social media for evidence of anti-Semitism or support for Palestinians and Hamas.

The Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) is a portal used by the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to track international students and exchange program visitors. According to an ICE release, the visa status of 4,736 international students was terminated in the SEVIS system, mostly holding F1 visas. AILA described these administrative actions as unprecedented, raising several legal questions that may require litigation.
The impact of these visa revocations is significant, with 50 per cent of the 327 cases being Optional Practical Training (OPT) holders. OPT allows international students on F-1 visas to work in the US for up to 12 months. With their visas revoked, these students are now unable to work. The top states affected by these visa revocations are Texas, California, New York, Michigan, and Arizona.
However, its worthwhile to note that, around 1,000 international students at U.S. colleges, universities and university systems have had their visas revoked or their legal status terminated since late March, according to an Associated Press review of university statements and correspondence with school officials.
Many of the students losing their legal status are from India and China, which together account for more than half the international students at American colleges. But the terminations have not been limited to those from any one part of the world, lawyers said.
The Indian government has taken notice of the issue. Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal stated, ""We are aware that several Indian students have received communication from the US government regarding their F-1 visa status. We are looking into the matter. Our Embassy and consulate are in touch with the students.""",2025-05-03 05:01:24,Positive

The digital presence of candidates has become an extension of their personal brand and is as significant as formal documentation.
Advising students to be authentic and strategic with their social media account, Prashant A.Bhonsle, founder and CEO, Kuhoo Finance says, ""Celebrate your academic wins, cultural pride, and career goals, but avoid content that may be misunderstood across cultures. A balanced, thoughtful digital presence can reinforce your intent and become a quiet ally in your global education journey.""
""The digital world has become an extension of a candidate's resume,"" Mr Bhonsle adds. ""What you share online travels faster than your transcripts. Immigration officers now review social media as part of background checks. This way your posts can shape perceptions beyond borders.""
""Social media is no longer just personal,"" says Akshay Chaturvedi, founder and CEO of Leverage. ""It is a public narrative that can influence how anyone could perceive purpose of travel and mid-to-long-term goals. Students are hence now more conscious of maintaining a digital presence that reflects academic and professional goals without ambiguity. The political climate has made students more strategic, not just about what they study, but how they present themselves across all platforms.""
""Posts that highlight scholarly interests, research involvement, volunteer work, or creative projects can contribute positively to one's digital narrative,"" says Nandita Singh, manager - media labs (Growth), Athena Education. ""A thoughtful online identity should reflect academic commitment, professional aspirations, and respectful engagement with global issues.

The examination will take place from 2pm to 5pm in pen and paper mode. Over 22.7 lakh medical aspirants have registered for this year's exam. All students must report and enter their respective exam centres before 1.30pm.
The highly competitive test, which serves as a gateway to undergraduate medical courses at top government colleges, will be conducted at 5,453 centres across more than 500 cities nationwide. A three-tier surveillance mechanism-at the district, state, and national levels-has been put in place to ensure the exam is held fairly.
Most exam centres this year have been set up in government and government-aided schools, colleges, universities, and other educational institutions.
To ensure smooth operations, mock drills were conducted at all test centres a day prior. These drills assessed readiness in terms of mobile signal jammer functionality, adequate deployment of frisking personnel, and proper functioning of biometric verification systems.
The Ministry of Education has warned that any student found engaging in malpractice-before, during, or after the examination-will face legal action under the Public Examinations (Prevention of Unfair Means) Act, 2024. Offenders will be penalised as per the provisions of the law.

These measures follow serious allegations of irregularities, including a reported paper leak during last year's NEET exam, which sparked nationwide concern over the integrity of the process.
In a major crackdown ahead of the 2025 test, the NTA has flagged 116 social media channels-including 106 on Telegram and 10 on Instagram-for allegedly spreading misinformation. The agency also launched a dedicated portal to gather leads on claims of paper leaks circulating online. More than 1,500 such claims have already been received and are under review.
The NTA has released detailed guidelines for candidates to follow on exam day. These include:

The examination will take place from 2pm to 5pm in pen and paper mode. Over 22.7 lakh medical aspirants have registered for this year's exam. All students must report and enter their respective exam centres before 1.30pm.
The highly competitive test, which serves as a gateway to undergraduate medical courses at top government colleges, will be conducted at 5,453 centres across more than 500 cities nationwide. A three-tier surveillance mechanism-at the district, state, and national levels-has been put in place to ensure the exam is held fairly.
Most exam centres this year have been set up in government and government-aided schools, colleges, universities, and other educational institutions.
To ensure smooth operations, mock drills were conducted at all test centres a day prior. These drills assessed readiness in terms of mobile signal jammer functionality, adequate deployment of frisking personnel, and proper functioning of biometric verification systems.
The Ministry of Education has warned that any student found engaging in malpractice-before, during, or after the examination-will face legal action under the Public Examinations (Prevention of Unfair Means) Act, 2024. Offenders will be penalised as per the provisions of the law.

These measures follow serious allegations of irregularities, including a reported paper leak during last year's NEET exam, which sparked nationwide concern over the integrity of the process.
In a major crackdown ahead of the 2025 test, the NTA has flagged 116 social media channels-including 106 on Telegram and 10 on Instagram-for allegedly spreading misinformation. The agency also launched a dedicated portal to gather leads on claims of paper leaks circulating online. More than 1,500 such claims have already been received and are under review.
The NTA has released detailed guidelines for candidates to follow on exam day. These include:
Dress CodeTo maintain fairness, the following dress code must be adhered to:

While not as widely chosen yet by Indian students, France is emerging as an attractive destination due to its streamlined visa process and high acceptance rate of around 85 per cent. The documentation required is minimal, and visa processing is relatively quicker. Popular study areas in France include business, hospitality, and fashion.

United Arab Emirates (UAE)
For students interested in management and business programmes, the UAE is becoming a preferred choice. The country usually processes student visas in under 30 days and offers long-term visas of up to five years for meritorious students. With an acceptance rate between 70 per cent and 80 per cent, and lower overall education costs, the UAE is gaining traction among Indian students.
Philippines
Ranked 11th among the most preferred study destinations for Indian students, the Philippines is especially known for its medical and healthcare-related programmes. In 2023 alone, nearly 9,700 Indian students enrolled in its institutions. The visa application process is simple, and tuition fees are significantly lower than those in Western countries. The visa acceptance rate ranges between 75 per cent and 80 per cent.
These countries offer promising opportunities for Indian students seeking a hassle-free and affordable way to foreign education.",2025-05-04 17:02:40,Positive

Sectional movement will remain restricted, meaning candidates can proceed to the next section only once the allotted time has ended. PwD candidates will receive an additional 40 minutes.
Sharing insights on this year's Common Admission Test, Ram Kumar PN, Professor IIM Kozhikode and CAT 2025 Convenor says, ""There will be no significant structural differences between CAT 2025 and those of earlier years. The exam is designed to test the applicant's critical reasoning, analytical thinking, and problem-solving skills across all three sections, i.e., VARC, DILR, and QA.""
Students preparing for the exam should specifically account for logical reasoning, comprehension, and conceptual clarity, rather than relying on rote memorisation, adds Professor Kumar.
Talking about the preparation strategy for interviews, he adds, ""The preparation for the IIM interview rounds (which typically include the Personal Interview (PI) and the Written Ability Test (WAT)) must start immediately after the CAT exam, regardless of the applicant's score. These rounds carry significant weight, often between 30 per cent and 50 per cent of

the final selection score, making them critical for admission. The WAT assesses the candidate's written communication skills, clarity of thought, and ability to structure an argument under time pressure.""

But those who have sat on both sides of the process say the real ""secret"" to performing well is far simpler than most imagine. Admissions tutors, liaison officers and current students stress that Cambridge interviews are not designed to trip applicants up, but to understand how they think, how they respond to new ideas, and how they engage with unfamiliar material under gentle academic pressure.
Current Cambridge students and admissions professionals offered a wide range of advice to help applicants approach their interviews with confidence.
Ruby Cardie, a third-year law student at the University of Cambridge, said, ""The people interviewing you, they are just people as well. I tried to crack jokes for my interview. I tried to crack jokes for my interview. Did they necessarily land? No. But that doesn't matter. Just wear what you are comfortable in, they are not judging you on. How you look or where you come from, how you sound like. They just want to hear how you think.""
Emily Lawson-Todd, Schools Liaison Officer at St Catharine's College, emphasised that the interview is only one part of the process. ""The interview is only one part of a whole lot of things we use to judge and assess your application. It's not the be-all and end-all, even it feels like it is. So don't worry too much,"" she said.
Dr Marcus Tomalin, Director of Admissions at Trinity Hall, recommended simple, consistent practice with unfamiliar material.
""Any preparation for the interview, any practice for the interview, that involves the applicant, fairly frequently, you know, a few minutes, maybe each week looking at texts, they have never seen before and trying to make sense of them, and trying to interpret them, and explain and justify their interpretation of it. That's all going to be good practice. And again, I wouldn't suggest picking one text like that, and then analysing the same text again, and then the same, because again, that's how you become entrenched, make it a different text every time, so that you are always having to start from scratch every time.""
Dr Christopher Burlinson, Admissions Tutor at Jesus College, said students should focus on thinking rather than delivering rehearsed answers. ""We don't need long rehearsed speeches and we don't need you to agree with everything we say. We just need you to think.""

He added, ""So listen hard to what your interviewers ask you. Think hard about your response and don't worry if you have to change your mind, pause or ask for help. That shows us that you will be a good student.""
Ellie, Schools Liaison Officer at King's College, encouraged applicants not to panic if they face unfamiliar questions. ""Please also don't be afraid, if you don't know the answer to a question in an interview. There are going to be questions that you don't know. The answer to at first and that are designed to push you, you can absolutely ask for help or clarification from the interviewers to help guide you and give you a bit more context, and make sure to focus on what you do know. If there is an element of the question that you do understand or something that is familiar, you can talk about that and say, okay, so I understand this, but could you explain this a bit more or I might start from here and take it this way.""
Rossie, an HPSC student at Churchill College, said the key is to make your reasoning visible. ""Show your thought process. They are not kind of trying to trip you out. They just want to sort of see you the way you think. So explain what your thought process is, how you come to your decisions.""
Naomi Walker-Pearl, Deputy Admissions Tutor at Corpus Christi College, underlined that interviews are not memory tests.
""Some students might think that their interview will be a test of their A level or equivalent knowledge, that it's a bit of a memory test of school content. That's not the case at all. You might find that your interviewers might start off with something you have learnt at school. But quite quickly ask you to apply that knowledge to new situations and push you outside the school curriculum. And if you come out of your interview feeling like you have learnt something and you feel quite challenged, then I would say that there's a good chance that interview has gone quite well.""On presentation, a university official noted, ""There's no right way to look in your interview. You don't have to turn up in a suit, though you can if you want to. So just wear whatever makes you comfy and whatever you are going to feel good in on the day.""Ophelia, an HSPS student at Clare College, advised applicants to step back and relax before they enter the interview room.""Take maybe 15 minutes and half an hour before the interview just to chill out, have a cup of tea, stop looking over your notes and trust the process rather than stressing yourself out for no reason,"" she said.",2025-11-28 20:32:03,Positive

All subjects are important, but a few are tougher than others.
Physics, Chemistry, Legal Studies and Accountancy are considered the toughest exams among all. To ensure that the final exam does not come as a surprise, CBSE releases sample papers for all these subjects. Practising these sample papers also reduces exam anxiety and stress.
As everyone knows, Accountancy requires proper revision and concentration. To further reduce stress for students, CBSE has scheduled the Accountancy exam on February 24, 2026, right after Mass Media Studies, which is considered a relatively easy paper.
This year, the Accountancy exam will have 34 questions, and all of them will be compulsory. The question paper will be divided into two parts: A and B. Part A is compulsory for all candidates, while Part B is optional, students must attempt only one of the two options: (i) Analysis of Financial Statements or (ii) Computerised Accounting.

Accountancy is a highly scoring subject if you focus on accuracy, presentation, and practice. You can easily aim for 90+ with these proven strategies:
1. Master the Basics First:Chapters like Partnership Fundamentals and Company Accounts form the foundation. Practise journal entries daily small errors here cost heavy marks in longer questions.
2. Time Management:Allocate 1 hour for MCQs (quick scoring), 1 hour for short-answer questions and 1 hour for long-answer questions. Start with questions you are confident about to build momentum.
3. Workings are Key:Always show clear step-by-step workings for calculations. Even if the final answer is wrong, you can secure up to 50 per cent marks for correct steps.
4. Use Formats Religiously:Prepare Revaluation, Capital, Cash Flow, and other accounts in the exact CBSE-prescribed format with proper rulings and narrations - neat presentation fetches extra marks.
5. Practise Sample Papers & Previous Years:Solve the latest SQP and at least the last 10 years' papers in timed conditions.
6. Handle MCQs Smartly:Read the question and all options twice. Use the elimination method. In assertion-reasoning questions, check whether the reason correctly explains the assertion.
7. Part B Choice:Choose the option you are stronger in.
8. Revision Hacks:Create flashcards for formulas and ratios. Solve 2-3 full-length papers every week under exam conditions.",2025-11-28 20:32:12,Positive

For students planning to study abroad, choosing the right degree has become more important than ever. A new report from willrobotstakemyjob.com (WRTMJ), supported by course pricing data from IDP's database of over 2.5 lakh programmes, evaluates the automation risk, salary prospects and future demand across major occupations. Government labour statistics from Australia, the US, Canada and the UK also inform the study.
Healthcare Leads List Of AI-Safe Jobs
According to the report, the safest careers are those that require intensive human interaction and judgement-primarily in healthcare and medicine. These roles show near-zero automation risk, strong demand and high salaries, making them popular choices for international students.
Among undergraduate-level pathways, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, dentists, physicists, nurse midwives and physical therapists top the list. Physician assistants alone are expected to see 28.5 per cent job growth in the US by 2031, while nurse practitioner roles may rise by 46.3 per cent , one of the fastest expansions in the sector.
Despite the higher cost of studying medicine or dentistry, the payoff is significant: median annual US salaries range from 99,710 dollars for physical therapists to 2,36,000 dollars for urologists and rehabilitation physicians.

Top 10 Overall AI-Safe Jobs (Undergraduate Pathway)
(Key factors: median salary, growth outlook, cost, automation risk)
These roles dominate the highest scoring list due to excellent job prospects, minimal automation risk and strong earning potential.
High-Pay, High-Growth Jobs Requiring Postgraduate Study
The report also highlights careers that remain AI-proof but require postgraduate qualifications. Healthcare again leads with programmes in nursing practice, urology, anesthesiology, neurology, psychiatry, internal medicine and immunology.
Nurse practitioners rank highest, scoring 81.16, driven by rapid hiring needs and a median US salary of $126,260. Similarly, urologists and rehabilitation physicians maintain near-zero automation risk while averaging salaries above $230,000 annually.
Top AI-Safe Careers Requiring PG Degrees
Although postgraduate study increases costs-often adding $30,000 to $80,000-the long-term financial and job security benefits remain unmatched.
Human Skills Offer Biggest Shield Against AI
The report states that roles requiring empathy, complex decision-making and hands-on patient care are the least vulnerable to automation. For students eyeing international degrees, medicine, nursing, psychiatry, immunology and rehabilitation studies offer some of the safest and highest-reward pathways today.
With AI reshaping global workforces, degrees that combine human expertise with professional training are likely to remain in high demand-making healthcare the clear winner in the race for AI-proof careers.",2025-11-28 20:32:18,Positive
