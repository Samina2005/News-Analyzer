The speedster is quickly making gains in the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2025 top wicket-takers' charts, while also turning the season around for MI since his return to the T20 league. Bumrah missed the first few matches of the franchise, but since his return, not much has gone wrong for theHardik Pandya-led side. In fact, MI have won 6 of the last 7 matches that Bumrah has been a part of.
The consistency with which Bumrah bowls terrifies every single opponent. His talent, coupled with the approach towards the game, truly makes him an elite athlete, that arguably no one can match in the game at present. This is the reason Australian cricket greatAdam Gilchristdecided to draw comparisons between Bumrah and the GOAT Sir Donald Bradman.
""He's maybe the best bowler, fast bowler of all time. When you start stacking up the statistics and the varying conditions that he has to go out and execute those skills in, I guess you look at Sir Donald Bradman's numbers compared to his peers and he's just so far ahead, so I think Bumrah is sort of in that category across all the different variations that you get in conditions and pitches that you've got to bowl on. He's significantly further ahead than the peers around him, so that tells you we are truly watching greatness,"" Gilchrist said during a discussion on Cricbuzz.
Gilchrist was even asked if the Australians were ever intimidated by an Indian pacer in the past, the way they were in the 2024-25 Border-Gavaskar Trophy. His answer was a clear no.
""A seamer from India, consistently throughout, particularly the series that we just saw in the summer, back home in the Australian summer, no, I don't think so,"" Gilchrist said when he was asked whether Australians were intimidated and afraid of a bowler from India like they were against Jasprit Bumrah.
Former India spinnerMurali Kartik, who was also a part of the panel discussion on Thursday, called Bumrah a 'national treasure' for the country.
""He's a national treasure, I think at the moment for us a lot, whoever follows cricket and wants India to do well, during the BGT, I think all of us were wishing that he could bowl from both ends. India looked a different side and he looked a different bowler against Australia, he is, look, one of the things which I felt with Bumrah over the period of time is that he acclimatises to any pitch very quickly and I think many bowlers have a certain length that they bowl, but he doesn't have a certain length, he bowls the length which is required on that surface and that's his greatness, the oddity of his action,"" he said.

During the 14th over of the innings, Abhishek was struck on his shoes by a yorker and although the umpire was not interested in the LBW appeal, GT went for a review.

The result meant SRH are all but out of the playoffs race, even as GT boosted their prospects.
The trio of Gill, Buttler and Sai Sudharsan fired in unison to propel GT to 224 for six.

This was after Gill blazed away to a 38-ball 76, and Sudharsan chipped in with a breezy 23-ball 48 while forging an opening stand of 87 runs in just 6.5 overs, following which Buttler took GT past 200 with his 64 off 37 deliveries.
Prasidh once again excelled with the ball for GT, finishing with excellent figures of 2/19 in 4 overs. The only cause of concern for GT this evening came when Ishant limped off the ground after failing to complete the final over.

Sunrisers Hyderabad won the toss and elected to bowl first against Gujarat Titans in Match 51 of Indian Premier League (IPL) 2025 at the Narendra Modi Stadium here on Friday. In the five matches that have been played at this venue, including Friday night's encounter, no team has elected to bat first at the Narendra Modi Stadium this season.
The Sunrisers Hyderabad sit on the verge of elimination. A loss on the night could see them become the third team after Chennai Super Kings and Rajasthan Royals to have been eliminated from the tournament.
Sunrisers Hyderabad captainPat Cumminssaid, ""We will have a bowl. You never really know what you will get. Sometimes it is better to bat at night. We won our first game at CSK's venue. Hopefully, the trend continues here as well. If we win all our games, we still have a chance. We haven't quite clicked as a team. In the last couple of games, we have done better. Same team.""
The Titans have certainly stumbled along their way, after having won four games on the trot and occupying the top spot in the table for the initial phase of the tournament, and are coming off a thumping loss against the Rajasthan Royals. The home side has made one change to their lineup withGerald Coetzeecoming in place ofKarim Janat.
Gujarat Titans skipperShubman Gillsaid, ""We would have bowled first as well. Looks like a good wicket. Last game here, we played against Mumbai, and we batted as well. The season has been pretty good for us. Nothing changes us for us. This is the time when a good team peaks. We are not really looking at the NRR. We are looking to see each game as it is. We have one change. Gerald comes in for Karim.""

The original estimated budget for the renovation of PCB venues in Karachi, Lahore and Rawalpindi was 12.3 billion Pakistani rupees (approx. Rs 383 crore), which has now gone up to 18 billion rupees (approx. Rs 561 crore). The tournament begins february 19 with India playing all their matches in Dubai from February 20.
The PCB's Board of Governors (BOG) has approved the additional cost. The board's chief financial officer has also been given approval for an overdraft of 3 to 6 billion rupees (if required) for the current fiscal year budget.
According to a report in the 'Dawn' newspaper, the CFO told the BOG at a meeting in December that considering the anticipated overall future cash flow requirements, there is a strong possibility that the PCB will require external cash flow support for the foreseeable future.
The report, quoting documents from the BOG meeting, said the management has agreed, in principle, to secure external cash overdraft facilities in the amount of three billion to six billion to support any unexpected additional funding requirements.
The documents also reveal that in the last fiscal year, the board had reserves of approximately 26 billion rupees.
But the board had to sell out the broadcast rights and others for the next three years (2024-26) for 1.70 billion rupees, which was less than its reserve price of around billion plus initially quoted by the PCB.
The PCB will also generate revenues after this year's Pakistan Super League by adding two more teams to the league while its 10-year contracts with the existing franchises also ends this year and can be renegotiated.
Since its creation the PCB has been a self-supporting sports body in Pakistan not dependent on any funding from government and has never complained of any serious financial crunch.

The Champions Trophy will also be the first mega event where BCCI's new guidelines regarding travelling family members, personal staff will come into effect in a stringent way.
According to a report inCricbuzz, the BCCI is absolutely strict about implementing the guidelines. A formal SOP has been shared formally with all the players on travel, nets, luggage allowances, and accompanying family members. The report added players were told during the recent third ODI in Ahmedabad that the disciplinary guidelines were non-negotiable.
""There is no going back on this and the players have made aware that the BCCI is very serious about the SOPs,"" the report quoted a source as saying.
One clause of the guidelines say: ""All players are required to stay for the entire duration of scheduled practice sessions and travel together to and from the venue. This rule ensures commitment and fosters a strong work ethic within the team."" According to the above-mentioned report, ""violation of this rule could be seriously viewed by the BCCI.""
A report in news agency PTI said if there is any exception, the players will have to bear the expenses.
""If anything changes then it is different but as of now, the players are unlikely to be accompanied by their wives or partners for this tour. One of the senior players had enquired about it and he was told that the policy decision will be followed,"" a senior BCCI source said.
""Since the tour is of less than one month, families won't be accompanying the players. But if exceptions are made, I think that individual will have to bear the full expenses as BCCI won't be covering any cost.""
The senior official said that most of the rules have already been enforced by the BCCI.
""If you look at it, already no player can ask for a private vehicle to come for practice. All state units have been notified. Similarly once the players assembled in Kolkata (for the T20I series against England) and Nagpur (for the ODI series against the same side), the team has travelled together,"" he confirmed.

The speedster is quickly making gains in the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2025 top wicket-takers' charts, while also turning the season around for MI since his return to the T20 league. Bumrah missed the first few matches of the franchise, but since his return, not much has gone wrong for theHardik Pandya-led side. In fact, MI have won 6 of the last 7 matches that Bumrah has been a part of.
The consistency with which Bumrah bowls terrifies every single opponent. His talent, coupled with the approach towards the game, truly makes him an elite athlete, that arguably no one can match in the game at present. This is the reason Australian cricket greatAdam Gilchristdecided to draw comparisons between Bumrah and the GOAT Sir Donald Bradman.
""He's maybe the best bowler, fast bowler of all time. When you start stacking up the statistics and the varying conditions that he has to go out and execute those skills in, I guess you look at Sir Donald Bradman's numbers compared to his peers and he's just so far ahead, so I think Bumrah is sort of in that category across all the different variations that you get in conditions and pitches that you've got to bowl on. He's significantly further ahead than the peers around him, so that tells you we are truly watching greatness,"" Gilchrist said during a discussion on Cricbuzz.
Gilchrist was even asked if the Australians were ever intimidated by an Indian pacer in the past, the way they were in the 2024-25 Border-Gavaskar Trophy. His answer was a clear no.
""A seamer from India, consistently throughout, particularly the series that we just saw in the summer, back home in the Australian summer, no, I don't think so,"" Gilchrist said when he was asked whether Australians were intimidated and afraid of a bowler from India like they were against Jasprit Bumrah.
Former India spinnerMurali Kartik, who was also a part of the panel discussion on Thursday, called Bumrah a 'national treasure' for the country.
""He's a national treasure, I think at the moment for us a lot, whoever follows cricket and wants India to do well, during the BGT, I think all of us were wishing that he could bowl from both ends. India looked a different side and he looked a different bowler against Australia, he is, look, one of the things which I felt with Bumrah over the period of time is that he acclimatises to any pitch very quickly and I think many bowlers have a certain length that they bowl, but he doesn't have a certain length, he bowls the length which is required on that surface and that's his greatness, the oddity of his action,"" he said.

In the five matches that have been played at this venue, including Friday night's encounter, no team has elected to bat first at the Narendra Modi Stadium this season.
The Sunrisers Hyderabad sit on the verge of elimination. A loss on the night could see them become the third team after Chennai Super Kings and Rajasthan Royals to have been eliminated from the tournament.
Sunrisers Hyderabad captainPat Cumminssaid, ""We will have a bowl. You never really know what you will get. Sometimes it is better to bat at night. We won our first game at CSK's venue. Hopefully, the trend continues here as well. If we win all our games, we still have a chance. We haven't quite clicked as a team. In the last couple of games, we have done better. Same team.""
The Titans have certainly stumbled along their way, after having won four games on the trot and occupying the top spot in the table for the initial phase of the tournament, and are coming off a thumping loss against the Rajasthan Royals. The home side has made one change to their lineup withGerald Coetzeecoming in place ofKarim Janat.
Gujarat Titans skipperShubman Gillsaid, ""We would have bowled first as well. Looks like a good wicket. Last game here, we played against Mumbai, and we batted as well.

The original estimated budget for the renovation of PCB venues in Karachi, Lahore and Rawalpindi was 12.3 billion Pakistani rupees (approx. Rs 383 crore), which has now gone up to 18 billion rupees (approx. Rs 561 crore). The tournament begins february 19 with India playing all their matches in Dubai from February 20.
The PCB's Board of Governors (BOG) has approved the additional cost. The board's chief financial officer has also been given approval for an overdraft of 3 to 6 billion rupees (if required) for the current fiscal year budget.
According to a report in the 'Dawn' newspaper, the CFO told the BOG at a meeting in December that considering the anticipated overall future cash flow requirements, there is a strong possibility that the PCB will require external cash flow support for the foreseeable future.
The report, quoting documents from the BOG meeting, said the management has agreed, in principle, to secure external cash overdraft facilities in the amount of three billion to six billion to support any unexpected additional funding requirements.
The documents also reveal that in the last fiscal year, the board had reserves of approximately 26 billion rupees.
But the board had to sell out the broadcast rights and others for the next three years (2024-26) for 1.70 billion rupees, which was less than its reserve price of around billion plus initially quoted by the PCB.
The PCB will also generate revenues after this year's Pakistan Super League by adding two more teams to the league while its 10-year contracts with the existing franchises also ends this year and can be renegotiated.
Since its creation the PCB has been a self-supporting sports body in Pakistan not dependent on any funding from government and has never complained of any serious financial crunch.

The Champions Trophy will also be the first mega event where BCCI's new guidelines regarding travelling family members, personal staff will come into effect in a stringent way.
According to a report inCricbuzz, the BCCI is absolutely strict about implementing the guidelines. A formal SOP has been shared formally with all the players on travel, nets, luggage allowances, and accompanying family members. The report added players were told during the recent third ODI in Ahmedabad that the disciplinary guidelines were non-negotiable.
""There is no going back on this and the players have made aware that the BCCI is very serious about the SOPs,"" the report quoted a source as saying.
One clause of the guidelines say: ""All players are required to stay for the entire duration of scheduled practice sessions and travel together to and from the venue. This rule ensures commitment and fosters a strong work ethic within the team."" According to the above-mentioned report, ""violation of this rule could be seriously viewed by the BCCI.""
A report in news agency PTI said if there is any exception, the players will have to bear the expenses.
""If anything changes then it is different but as of now, the players are unlikely to be accompanied by their wives or partners for this tour. One of the senior players had enquired about it and he was told that the policy decision will be followed,"" a senior BCCI source said.
""Since the tour is of less than one month, families won't be accompanying the players. But if exceptions are made, I think that individual will have to bear the full expenses as BCCI won't be covering any cost.""
The senior official said that most of the rules have already been enforced by the BCCI.
""If you look at it, already no player can ask for a private vehicle to come for practice. All state units have been notified. Similarly once the players assembled in Kolkata (for the T20I series against England) and Nagpur (for the ODI series against the same side), the team has travelled together,"" he confirmed.

It is understood that the BCCI is trying to get a few chefs on board to meet the special dietary requirements of certain players.",2025-05-03 05:02:28,Positive

CSK were the first team to crash out of the playoffs race and former West Indies batter Darren Ganga once again questioned the decision to give the captaincy to Dhoni following an injury toRuturaj Gaikwad. During an interaction on ESPNCricinfo, Ganga did not hold back while discussing the CSK captaincy situation and questioned the franchise on their over-reliance on Dhoni and the lack of a proper transition plan.
“Is that not a high risk for a team if you're planning for next season, you're pegging your hopes on a player who's not playing competitive cricket between IPL seasons,” Ganga said.
“Isn't that putting yourself at a disadvantage based on that player's fitness and availability to play an entire season? You find yourself back at square one, where you will be searching for a captain, a man who is not part of the entire process of strategic planning and direction for a season. So I feel you're in that constant cycle of development and not progressing.”
Ganga conceded that Dhoni still deserves a place in the CSK playing XI before adding that the fact that he still holds captaincy ambitions can prove to be detrimental to the entire situation.
“Yes. I surely think with the big option of the fact that he's put himself forward and what we've seen from him as a wicketkeeper and a batter at the back end of innings, he can command himself on that team,” he said.
“But my biggest question is, should he be considered a captain in that squad when you 18 years from the start of him leading the side. We all agree theoretically that it's sport, it's cyclical, and leadership has a shelf life.”
“But I feel having a guy like Ruturaj Gaikwad and, in the past,Ravindra Jadejain that sort of unsettling situation where it seems that MS still has ambitions of captaincy is not a good situation to be in. I've been in that situation before. It is very unsettling for you when you know that there's someone behind you who still has ambitions. But it is being shown as though he is not interested,” he added.

Half-centuries by Shubman Gill and Jos Buttler saw Gujarat post a massive total of 224/6 in the first innings at the Narendra Modi Stadium. Despite Abhishek Sharma's 74-run fighting knock, there was not enough fight by the batters to chase it down, and they fizzled to 186/6.
Sunrisers have won only three of their 10 games so far this season, and their fate now depends on other fixtures going their way. However, Cummins believes that hope is still there for the franchise, given the mega auctions that took place in 2024, ensuring the core of the team will remain the same for years to follow.
“Our power-play with the bat wasn't too great. I was as guilty as anyone else. Probably let them get 20-30 extra runs. Maybe hang on to one or two catches. Again, I am guilty there. Chasing 200 looked a bit more realistic. They are class batters. They don't do anything outlandish. If you bowl bad balls, they just put them away.
“We probably dished out too many bad balls. It is a really good wicket. Going for 140 in the last 14 overs was good on the bowling part. Sharma batted nicely. Nitish at the end. Left a little too much and too late for the batters. We can cling to some hope. Big auction last year. The core of the group will be there for three years,” said Cummins during the post-game presentation on Friday.
With the win, Gujarat moved past Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) into second place in the points table courtesy of their superior run rate. RCB will take on Chennai Super Kings on Saturday in what could be a pivotal result for Gujarat Titans.

The win made GT's case further strong for a spot in the playoffs. It was a seventh win in 10 matches for the Shubman Gill-led side and it moved to the second spot in the table with 14 points to its credit. Mumbai Indians, who too have as many points to their credit, continue to hold the top spot on the basis of a better net run rate.
GT's Sai Sudharsan has taken the Orange Cap from MI's Suryakumar Yadav with 504 runs in 10 matches. Meanwhile, GT fast bowler Prasidh Krishna has taken the Purple Cap from RCB pacer Josh Hazlewood with 19 wickets in 10 games.
Gujarat Titans roared back to winning ways with a 38-run mauling of Sunrisers Hyderabad after Prasidh Krishna's outstanding bowling complemented Shubman Gill and Jos Buttler's explosive half-centuries in IPL 2025 at Ahmedabad on Friday.
The result meant SRH are all but out of the playoffs race, even as GT boosted their prospects.
The trio of Gill, Buttler and Sai Sudharsan fired in unison to propel GT to 224 for six.
In reply, SRH were off to a good start too but could not sustain for long and were stopped at 186 for six. Abhishek Sharma top-scored for SRH with 74 off 41 balls.
This was after Gill blazed away to a 38-ball 76, and Sudharsan chipped in with a breezy 23-ball 48 while forging an opening stand of 87 runs in just 6.5 overs, following which Buttler took GT past 200 with his 64 off 37 deliveries.
Prasidh once again excelled with the ball for GT, finishing with excellent figures of 2/19 in 4 overs. The only cause of concern for GT this evening came when Ishant limped off the ground after failing to complete the final over.
SRH, though, meant business at the start of their innings as Mohammed Siraj (2/33) went for 22 runs in his first two overs, while Ishant Sharma conceded 20 in his first two.
However, a spectacular catch in the deep by Rashid Khan ended Travis Head's innings after he covered a lot of ground to reach the ball, having run from deep square leg and then change his direction to judge it to perfection.
Ishan Kishan got out for 13 after consuming 17 balls, as the required rate went over 14.
Despite the presence of Abhishek and Heinrich in the middle for SRH, the match was already in GT's bag thanks to the asking rate that gone past 16.
Meanwhile, an upset Gill engaged in an animated chat with the two umpires over a review call involving Abhishek, who was seen trying to calm the GT captain.
Sent in to bat, Gujarat Titans skipper Gill got the innings underway with a flick off a loose Mohammed Shami delivery for a six.
Having conceded 11 runs in the first over, Shami looked off-colour as Sudharsan dispatched the seamer for five boundaries, including four on the trot.
SRH captain Pat Cummins brought himself into the attack, but the carnage continued as Gill launched into his opposite number, first greeting him with a cover drive and then playing an even better shot shot through the gap between mid-off and cover.
It was a forgettable start for Cummins as Gill smoked the Australian speedster for a maximum over deep mid-wicket to collect 17 from that over.
The best part of their game was that both Gill and Sudharsan were toying with the SRH bowlers without taking any risks and instead relied on class to get the runs.
GT amassed 82 runs in the power play, following which spin was introduced in the form of Zeeshan Ali and the leg-spinner gave his team a much-needed breakthrough by having Sudharsan caught by keeper Heinrich Klaasen off a googly.
In the company of Buttler, Gill continued at the same pace and reached his half-century with a beautiful drive through extra cover for a four, taking 25 balls to get to his fifty.
Buttler also looked in good nick and smashed Ansari straight down the ground for a six, and three balls later, the Englishman crossed 4000 runs in IPL.
Worse was in store for SRH as Cummins dropped Gill after Harshal Patel deceived the batter with a slower ball. Gill was on 66.
However, the GT captain was run out following a throw by Harshal at short fine-leg and Klaasen, instead of catching the ball deflected it onto the stumps.

The best part of their game was that both Gill and Sudharsan were toying with the SRH bowlers without taking any risks and instead relied on class to get the runs.
GT amassed 82 runs in the power play, following which spin was introduced in the form of Zeeshan Ali and the leg-spinner gave his team a much-needed breakthrough by having Sudharsan caught by keeperHeinrich Klaasenoff a googly.
In the company of Buttler, Gill continued at the same pace and reached his half-century with a beautiful drive through extra cover for a four, taking 25 balls to get to his fifty.
Buttler also looked in good nick and smashed Ansari straight down the ground for a six, and three balls later, the Englishman crossed 4000 runs in IPL.
Worse was in store for SRH as Cummins dropped Gill afterHarshal Pateldeceived the batter with a slower ball. Gill was on 66.
However, the GT captain did not last long thereafter as he was run out following a throw by Harshal at short fine-leg and Klaasen, instead of catching the ball deflected it onto the stumps. The TV umpire took his time before ruling in favour of SRH.
Buttler then propped up GT with his power-hitting.

Over the past two days, Bengaluru has experienced incessant rain, and the trend could continue on the match day as well. According to the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD), ""Rain or thundershowers would occur towards afternoon or evening.""
According to ESPNcricinfo, rain hampered both teams' preparations on the eve of the clash as well. Chennai began its training at 3 pm but could only practice on the field for 45 minutes before the rain intervened. The players then returned to train at 4.30 pm.
Royal Challengers Bengaluru came to practice around 5 pm. Virat Kohli and Devdutt Padikkal batted for around 45 minutes to an hour before rain pelted.
This time, the rain did not ease off for three hours, so RCB's practice session had to be cancelled. Throughout the evening, there was a thunderstorm and occasional lightning, which led to waterlogging in several parts of the city.
Chennai, the five-time champions, have already been knocked out of the race for the playoffs, with just two wins out of ten fixtures, sitting at the bottom of the table.
However, for RCB, the fixture was an invaluable opportunity to move to the top of the table with 16 points. The Royal Challengers occupy the third spot on the points table with seven wins and three defeats.
Bengaluru witnessed a match between RCB and Punjab Kings last month that was reduced to 14 overs a side due to persistent rain.
Chennai will face RCB in Bengaluru for the first time since the nail-biting affair in 2024. In that fixture, RCB's 27-run triumph helped them achieve the unthinkable and scrape their way through the playoffs.
In the ongoing season, RCB registered its first win at Chepauk for the first time since 2008 as they breezed past the Super Kings with a thumping 50-run victory.

The 38-run loss at the Narendra Modi Stadium leavesPat Cumminsand his troops on the ninth spot with just six points from 10 matches. SRH can only reach a maximum of 14 points at the end of league phase, with only four matches left to play. However, they still have an outside chance of making it to the playoffs.
SRH will have to win all of their remaining games, but all by good margins as their current net run-rate is -1.192.
They would also hope that other results go their way as there are currently three times -- Mumbai Indians, Gujarat Titans and SunRisers Hyderabad -- already on 14 points each.
Punjab Kings are fourth on the table with 13 points after there match against the Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) was washed out. Both teams were awarded a point each.
Barring CSK and Rajasthan Royals, the remaining eight teams are all in contention to make it to the playoffs.
After the match, SRH captain Pat Cummins opened up and blamed himself for the team's loss.
""A couple of things. Our powerplay with the bat wasn't too great. I was as guilty as anyone else. Probably let them get 20-30 extra runs. Maybe hang on to one or two catches. Again I am guilty there. Chasing 200 looked a bit more realistic. They are class batters. They don't do anything outlandish. If you bowl bad balls, they just put them away,"" Pat Cummins said in the post-match presentation.
""We probably dished out too many bad balls. It is a really good wicket. Going for 140 in the last 14 overs was good on the bowling part. Sharma batted nicely. Nitish at the end. Left a little too much and too late for the batters. We can cling to some hope. Big auction last year. The core of the group will be there for three years. So, lots to play for. It is an amazing venue to play. They are so nice and loud,"" the right-arm seamer added.

India are co-hosts, alongside Sri Lanka, for this year's Asia Cup. While the dates and venues for the event are yet to be confirmed, a report recent claimed that the Asia Cup might not take place this year owing to tensions between India and Pakistan.
Gavaskar was also of the opinion that if the Asia Cup does take place this year, it is highly unlikely for Pakistan to take part in the continental event.
""BCCI's stance has always been what the government of India tells them to do. So I don't think it would be any different when it comes to the Asia Cup. India and Sri Lanka are the hosts for this particular edition of the Asia Cup, so it depends on whether things have changed at all, but if things haven't changed, I can't see Pakistan now being part of the Asia Cup, which is going to be hosted by India and Sri Lanka,"" Gavaskar toldSports Today.
Gavaskar also suggested that the ACC might get dissolved if the situation doesn't improve.
""I don't know how it will be. It might be that the Asian Cricket Council could well be disbanded, and you could just have a three-nation tour, that could well have a three-nation tournament, or a four-nation tournament with maybe Hong Kong or UAE being invited. So that could well happen, the Asian Cricket Council could well be disbanded. But I think it is dependent on what happens in the next couple of months,"" he added.
Gavaskar also pointed out that if India pulls out of the Asia Cup, they might invite other Asian teams for a multi-nation event in India.
""It could well happen that India decides to pull out of the Asian Cricket Council that could well happen. We can say look we're going to have a 4 nation tournament or a 5 nation tournament in Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Afghanistan, and it could be, it could well be that if the tournament is held in Bangladesh, the tournament is held in Sri Lanka, but obviously India is going to be the host, then India will host it in India,"" he added.
""I won't be surprised at all if the Asian Cricket Council gets disbanded with what's been happening. I mean if you've got two countries, you know, fighting against each other, then it's, it's a little bit difficult to, to play sport with each other,"" Gavaskar explained.",2025-05-03 13:52:58,Negative

It also allowed Kohli to fulfil his prophecy from before, as he had warned Khaleel earlier in the season during an altercation from the first time these two sides met.
On March 28, during the first meeting between CSK and RCB in IPL 2025, pacer Khaleel Ahmed had started celebrating Virat Kohli's wicket even though the latter hadn't been given out.
Following that, Kohli had seemingly jokingly warned the pacer that he would dish out the treatment on the field when they meet next.

""Ab tu aa (You come once again),"" Kohli had told Khaleel, hinting that he would not spare the pacer the next time they met.
Kohli's performance on Saturday ensured that his prophecy came true. The 36-year-old clobbered Khaleel for two consecutive sixes to finish off the third over of RCB's innings.

It was a day to forget for Khaleel. In his two overs in the powerplay, he was slammed for 32 runs by Kohli andJacob Bethell. However, his misery was compiled at the end when RCB finisherRomario Shepherdsmashed 33 runs off him, to complete the most expensive over in IPL 2025.
Khaleel was smashed for four sixes and two boundaries in the over by Shepherd, who ended up slamming the joint-second-fastest half-century in IPL history, thanks to his 14-ball 53.
Shepherd's knock took RCB past the 200-run mark, and ensured they reach a total of 213/5 in 20 overs. The total proved to be enough as CSK narrowly fell short.
Khaleel has enjoyed a good season despite his team's poor form, taking 14 wickets in 11 matches.

Following Dhoni's wicket, left-hand batterShivam Dubecame out. He slammed his first ball out of the park, which was a no-ball, too.

In a candid conversation onYouTube, Sania spoke about a lot of topics - ranging from struggles of juggling societal expectations and responsibilities women face in parenting. Sania said that it is never 50-50 when it  comes to the responsibilities of the two parents and even shared some personal anecdotes.
“It is never 50-50 between both parents… I breastfed for 2.5-3 months. For me, that was the hardest part of pregnancy. I am like, I will get pregnant three more times, but this feeding business, I don't know if I can do. For me, it was not the physical aspect of it, but the emotional and mental aspects that were draining. As working women, it ties you down. They are so dependent on it, time commitment, not enough sleep, and you are centering all activities around the feeding schedule. I did what was needful.”
Sania even spoke about the guilt she felt while travelling for the first time since the birth of her son. In a conversation that resonated with working mothers, Sania said that she had to travel to Delhi for an event just six weeks after the birth of her son and shared her feelings during that journey.
“The first time I left Izhaan, he was six weeks old. It was the hardest flight I've taken, I think. I had to go to Delhi for an event, and I said I can't do it. I was being dramatic because, honestly, it isn't. Like people do that all the time, and kids are absolutely fine. We beat ourselves over it because we are giving ourselves mom's guilt,” Sania said in the interview.

Following that, Kohli had seemingly jokingly warned the pacer that he would dish out the treatment on the field when they meet next.

""Ab tu aa (You come once again),"" Kohli had told Khaleel, hinting that he would not spare the pacer the next time they met.
Kohli's performance on Saturday ensured that his prophecy came true. The 36-year-old clobbered Khaleel for two consecutive sixes to finish off the third over of RCB's innings.

It was a day to forget for Khaleel. In his two overs in the powerplay, he was slammed for 32 runs by Kohli andJacob Bethell. However, his misery was compiled at the end when RCB finisherRomario Shepherdsmashed 33 runs off him, to complete the most expensive over in IPL 2025.
Khaleel was smashed for four sixes and two boundaries in the over by Shepherd, who ended up slamming the joint-second-fastest half-century in IPL history, thanks to his 14-ball 53.
Shepherd's knock took RCB past the 200-run mark, and ensured they reach a total of 213/5 in 20 overs. The total proved to be enough as CSK narrowly fell short.
Khaleel has enjoyed a good season despite his team's poor form, taking 14 wickets in 11 matches.
Kohli has hit form at the right team, with Royal Challengers Bengaluru moving up to the top of the IPL 2025 points table with their victory over CSK. Having won eight out of their 11 games so far, RCB are now up to 16 points and their spot in the playoffs look certain.

Shepherd smashed four sixes and two boundaries in the over, before completing a 14-ball half-century in the next over.
The fan complained over the fact that Dhoni didn't give the over toSam Curran, a decision which proved costly in the end as CSK lost the match by three runs.
NOONE WILL DISCUSS MS DHONI CAPTAINCY BLUNDER OF NOT GIVING 19TH OVER TO SAM CURRAN!!I REPEAT NOONE!!
Dhoni batted poorly tonightBut I don't think Dube straightaway would have made a better impact as he himself had a poor season and RCB might have given pace then.Also Khaleel has been given the 19th mostly but yeah could have done it differently in hidsight.
In the last over, the Chennai side needed 15 runs to win, with Jadeja and MS Dhoni on the crease. On the first three balls,Yash Dayalgave just two runs and took Dhoni's wicket.
Following Dhoni's wicket, left-hand batterShivam Dubecame out. He slammed his first ball out of the park, which was a no-ball, too.
After this no-ball, the equation was six off three, where Dayal held his nerve and gave away just four runs on the last three balls of the 20th over.
Yash Dayal snapped one wicket in his spell of four overs, where he conceded 41 runs at an economy of 10.20.
Speaking on Yash Dayal's performance at the post-match presentation, RCB batting coachDinesh Karthiksaid, ""Good choice of words there - work ethic. He is right up there with some of the best that is there in India, the one thing that you see with the young crop of cricketers is how much they work hard behind the scenes, Yash is someone who is very diligent, comes to meeting with a paper and writes down everything that he wants to do, the execution might be up and down at times, but one thing you will not get less from him is effort.""

Apart from this thrilling encounter, the match also had an interesting moment when CSK skipperMS Dhonitook the bat gauge from the on-field umpire's hand.
The incident took place in the 17th over of CSK's chase when Dhoni walked-in to bat afterLungi Ngidi's dismissal. As Dhoni came in, the umpire took out the gauge but the CSK skipper's bat failed the test. Seeing this, the legendary wicketkeeper-batter took the gauge the measured the bat by himself.
Although the gauge did not pass through Dhoni's bat cleanly, he still got a nod from the on-field umpire to continue.

In a candid conversation onYouTube, Sania spoke about a lot of topics - ranging from struggles of juggling societal expectations and responsibilities women face in parenting. Sania said that it is never 50-50 when it  comes to the responsibilities of the two parents and even shared some personal anecdotes.
“It is never 50-50 between both parents… I breastfed for 2.5-3 months. For me, that was the hardest part of pregnancy. I am like, I will get pregnant three more times, but this feeding business, I don't know if I can do. For me, it was not the physical aspect of it, but the emotional and mental aspects that were draining. As working women, it ties you down. They are so dependent on it, time commitment, not enough sleep, and you are centering all activities around the feeding schedule. I did what was needful.”
Sania even spoke about the guilt she felt while travelling for the first time since the birth of her son. In a conversation that resonated with working mothers, Sania said that she had to travel to Delhi for an event just six weeks after the birth of her son and shared her feelings during that journey.
“The first time I left Izhaan, he was six weeks old. It was the hardest flight I've taken, I think. I had to go to Delhi for an event, and I said I can't do it. I was being dramatic because, honestly, it isn't. Like people do that all the time, and kids are absolutely fine. We beat ourselves over it because we are giving ourselves mom's guilt,” Sania said in the interview.

The likes ofPrabhsimran Singh,Shreyas Iyer, and Shashank Singh contributed the most with the bat, adding scores of 91, 45 and 33 respectively but another batter whose cameo helped the team put a resounding total on the board wasJosh Inglis. The Australian hadn't done much with the bat until the match in Dharamsala, where he was promoted to the No. 3 spot. After the game, PBKS head coachRicky Pontingrevealed that the decision to change Inglis' role was taken by skipper Shreyas Iyer.
""It was actually a move that the captain came up with, and Shreyas thought, on that sort of a pitch, against that bowling attack, it would be the right thing to. If a wicket fell early, to send Inglis in. We felt that Mayank would bowl early on, and if you look at the way he bowls, he generally bowls reasonably short, and that's one of Inglis' great strengths. As you saw tonight, those pull shots were pretty amazing straight away,"" Ponting revealed in the press conference.
Inglis scored 30 runs from just 14 balls afterPriyansh Aryadeparted for a 4-ball 1. Inglis scored 4 sixes during his cameo, setting the tone for Punjab's performance with the bat. While LSG were preparing against Priyansh, Prabsimran and Iyer at the top of the batting order, Inglis came out of syllabus.
""So, yeah, that was what the captain wanted to do. It then also allows us to have, you know, Iyer, Wadhera and Shashank through the middle of the innings, which is what we thought would be crucial for us in tonight's game as well. It was probably a surprise call for LSG to see him go out, and it paid off for us tonight.
""Once we got off to a [flier] you know, I think we were 70-odd at the end of the power play, all the momentum was going with us, and you see with our batting, we've got someone like Azmatullah at number nine, so we bat really, really deep, It allows our top order to play with a lot of freedom, and they did that tonight.""
In the press conference, Ponting also revealed that he had backed at least one of Prabhsimran Singh and Priyansh Arya to get a hundred in the match against LSG. Prabhsimran came quite close, scoring 91 from 48 balls in the match.
""Him (Prabhsimran) and Priyansh have got us off to some great starts in the tournament. They both before today, had both made 350 runs each in the tournament. I sort of challenged both of the openers in the team meeting today for one of them to go on and get a hundred in this match, and unfortunately, Prabh fell a little bit short of that.
""With our batting group, we've just given some really clear direction of the way that we want them to play to understand how important top order partnerships are in this competition, and we know that if Priyansh and Prabh get going together, that they can be ultra destructive. Priyansh mainly more against the faster bowlers, and Prabh's as good a hitter against anybody going around, so they complement each other really well, being left hand, right hand, with one probably being slightly better against the quicks, and the other against spinners.
""It's a really good, a really good group. That's why when we sat down as a group, heading in, thinking about our auction strategy and the players that we wanted to retain, I think you're starting to see why I was so keen to retain Prabhsimran. He's a very, very good young player, and he's very keen to bring success to this team, and that showed with the way that he played tonight.""

In fact, many see the 5-match Test series as an opportunity to begin the transition period in the longest format.

Despite a woeful tour of Australia, where rumours of Rohit contemplating retirement were also afloat, the skipper decided against announcing any change. Many feel the Test series against England could be Rohit's last. But, the 38-year-old doesn't seem to have finalised his plans yet.
As per a report in theTimes of India, the BCCI could giveShubman Gillthe vice-captain's role in England, having already made him the deputy in T20Is and ODIs. A senior Indian cricketer, however, has also expressed desire to take up the captaincy role in the short term, but the board, selectors and the coaches are only keen on exploring a long-term solution.
The paper claims that even head coachGautam Gambhirwould want a long-term solution to the problem. Stop-gap options simply don't interest him.
""A new WTC cycle is starting. Future and continuity have to be kept in mind as far as the team is concerned. Even coach Gautam Gambhir would want a set of players he is likely to work with for an extended period. There can't be any stop-gap solutions for such an important series. The last two Test series haven't been ideal for the team and the England series is very crucial,"" the paper quoted a source as saying.
With Gill, however, the problem of his inconsistency with the bat also remains. Though he has taken up the No. 3 spot in the Indian Test team, vacated byCheteshwar Pujara, his exploits with the bat have been far from convincing.
Of the 1893 Test runs that Gill has scored in his career, only 649 have come away from home. The England tour, hence, is expected to be quite challenging for the India batter, not only from his own batting point of view, but also from the perspective of a leadership candidate.",2025-05-05 23:04:31,Positive

As Prabsimran called his ailing father after his 48-ball 91, the message he received was that the batter threw his wicket away after getting so close to a century.
Prabhsimran's father, Sardar Surjit Singh, isn't going through the best of times, needing to get dialysis done three times a week. In such complicated times, Prabhsimran's performances for PBKS on the pitch have somehow managed to bring a smile back on Surjit Singh's face.
""The only time he smiles these days is when he sees Prabhsimran bat in the IPL,"" Surjit Singh's brother Satwinderpal Singh told theTimes of India.
""He is going through dialysis thrice a week. As an elder brother, I can't see the pain he is enduring. I have to step out of the house when the doctors come home for the dialysis.

While Prabhsimran is ruling the roost all across the country with his bat, his father and uncle enjoy his performances by sitting in front of the television in Patiala. In fact, when Surjit sees his son Prabhsimran hit a rash shot, he shouts in front of the TV, saying he should play cautiously.
""Before every Punjab Kings match, I carry him to the living room. We watch the match together, and every time the camera is on Simmu, he smiles. If Simmu scores, he keeps on smiling and laughing. In those moments, he forgets the pain he is in. If Simmu plays a rash shot, he shouts, 'khotte aaram naal khel (play sensibly).'""
When Prabsimran called his father after the 91-run knock against Lucknow, he was scolded by Surjit for not completing the ton.
""Simmu video called on Monday morning to take an update about Surjit. And my brother gave him back by saying why he threw away his wicket after getting so close to the hundred,"" said Satwinderpal with a laugh.
""While shouting at Simmu, he gasps for breath. Every time I have to intervene and tell him to praise the kid, because he is playing so well.""

Had skipper Pant shown more patience in the middle, things could've ended differently for the Super Giants.
Sanjiv Goenka, who has developed a reputation as a hard taskmaster after multiple on-field confrontations with his captains, was understandably not pleased to see Pant depart early.

After the game, Pant blamed the team's poor fielding as the reason behind the defeat.
""Definitely too many runs. When you're gonna drop crucial catches at the wrong time, it is going to hurt you badly. We thought it was going to do more. We didn't pick the length right at the start.

Despite a woeful tour of Australia, where rumours of Rohit contemplating retirement were also afloat, the skipper decided against announcing any change. Many feel the Test series against England could be Rohit's last. But, the 38-year-old doesn't seem to have finalised his plans yet.
As per a report in theTimes of India, the BCCI could giveShubman Gillthe vice-captain's role in England, having already made him the deputy in T20Is and ODIs. A senior Indian cricketer, however, has also expressed desire to take up the captaincy role in the short term, but the board, selectors and the coaches are only keen on exploring a long-term solution.
The paper claims that even head coachGautam Gambhirwould want a long-term solution to the problem. Stop-gap options simply don't interest him.
""A new WTC cycle is starting. Future and continuity have to be kept in mind as far as the team is concerned. Even coach Gautam Gambhir would want a set of players he is likely to work with for an extended period. There can't be any stop-gap solutions for such an important series. The last two Test series haven't been ideal for the team and the England series is very crucial,"" the paper quoted a source as saying.
With Gill, however, the problem of his inconsistency with the bat also remains. Though he has taken up the No. 3 spot in the Indian Test team, vacated byCheteshwar Pujara, his exploits with the bat have been far from convincing.
Of the 1893 Test runs that Gill has scored in his career, only 649 have come away from home. The England tour, hence, is expected to be quite challenging for the India batter, not only from his own batting point of view, but also from the perspective of a leadership candidate.",2025-05-05 23:04:36,Positive

The last couple of games might not have gone the teenager's way but he is still recognised as one of the finest talents in the game at present. Vaibhav, aged 14, promises of a big future, thanks to his undeniable talent. While the whole of India is proud of the skills he possess, his birth-state, Bihar, is understandably going ga-ga. In fact, even Prime Minister Narendra Modi praised Vaibhav for the way he has begun his IPL career.
""I have seen in the IPL, the son of Bihar,Vaibhav Suryavanshi's spectacular performance. At such a young age, Vaibhav has set such a great record. There is a lot of hard work behind Vaibhav's performance,"" PM Modi said in his address during the inauguration of the Khelo India Youth Games in Bihar.
Vaibhav, who hails from Samastipur in Bihar, famously hit a 35-ball hundred against the Gujarat Titans, breaking several records in the process. For PM Modi, there needs to be constant push on sports in the country to unearth more talents Vaibhav.
""To bring his talent to the forefront, he has played many matches at different levels. The more you play, the more you will shine. Competing in matches and competitions as much as possible is very important. The NDA government has always given it the highest priority in its policies.
""The government's focus is on giving our athletes the opportunity to play new sports. That is why the Khelo India Youth Games included Gatka, Kho-kho, Malkhambh and Yogasana. In recent days, our athletes have performed very well in many new sports like Wushu, Lawn Balls, and Roller Skating,"" PM Modi added.
""There is a new national education policy, in which we have made sports a part of mainstream education. The aim of this policy is to create excellent sports professionals along with good players in the country.
""My young friends, we know that sportsmanship plays a very important role in every aspect of life. We learn team spirit in the field of sports. We learn to move forward together,"" he said.

https://sports.ndtv.com/ipl-2025/ricky-ponting-reveals-how-shreyas-iyers-tactical-masterclass-left-lsg-stunned-8332580,Ricky Ponting shared insights into Shreyas Iyer's tactical masterclass during Sunday's match between PBKS and LSG.,2025-05-05 10:22:54,"Punjab Kings registered their highest score of the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2025 season, putting 236 on the board against Lucknow Super Giants (LSG). The likes ofPrabhsimran Singh,Shreyas Iyer, and Shashank Singh contributed the most with the bat, adding scores of 91, 45 and 33 respectively but another batter whose cameo helped the team put a resounding total on the board wasJosh Inglis. The Australian hadn't done much with the bat until the match in Dharamsala, where he was promoted to the No. 3 spot. After the game, PBKS head coachRicky Pontingrevealed that the decision to change Inglis' role was taken by skipper Shreyas Iyer.
""It was actually a move that the captain came up with, and Shreyas thought, on that sort of a pitch, against that bowling attack, it would be the right thing to. If a wicket fell early, to send Inglis in. We felt that Mayank would bowl early on, and if you look at the way he bowls, he generally bowls reasonably short, and that's one of Inglis' great strengths. As you saw tonight, those pull shots were pretty amazing straight away,"" Ponting revealed in the press conference.
Inglis scored 30 runs from just 14 balls afterPriyansh Aryadeparted for a 4-ball 1. Inglis scored 4 sixes during his cameo, setting the tone for Punjab's performance with the bat. While LSG were preparing against Priyansh, Prabsimran and Iyer at the top of the batting order, Inglis came out of syllabus.
""So, yeah, that was what the captain wanted to do. It then also allows us to have, you know, Iyer, Wadhera and Shashank through the middle of the innings, which is what we thought would be crucial for us in tonight's game as well. It was probably a surprise call for LSG to see him go out, and it paid off for us tonight.
""Once we got off to a [flier] you know, I think we were 70-odd at the end of the power play, all the momentum was going with us, and you see with our batting, we've got someone like Azmatullah at number nine, so we bat really, really deep, It allows our top order to play with a lot of freedom, and they did that tonight.""
In the press conference, Ponting also revealed that he had backed at least one of Prabhsimran Singh and Priyansh Arya to get a hundred in the match against LSG. Prabhsimran came quite close, scoring 91 from 48 balls in the match.
""Him (Prabhsimran) and Priyansh have got us off to some great starts in the tournament. They both before today, had both made 350 runs each in the tournament. I sort of challenged both of the openers in the team meeting today for one of them to go on and get a hundred in this match, and unfortunately, Prabh fell a little bit short of that.
""With our batting group, we've just given some really clear direction of the way that we want them to play to understand how important top order partnerships are in this competition, and we know that if Priyansh and Prabh get going together, that they can be ultra destructive. Priyansh mainly more against the faster bowlers, and Prabh's as good a hitter against anybody going around, so they complement each other really well, being left hand, right hand, with one probably being slightly better against the quicks, and the other against spinners.
""It's a really good, a really good group. That's why when we sat down as a group, heading in, thinking about our auction strategy and the players that we wanted to retain, I think you're starting to see why I was so keen to retain Prabhsimran. He's a very, very good young player, and he's very keen to bring success to this team, and that showed with the way that he played tonight.""

Among a number of such emerging stars stands tall Punjab Kings' opening batterPrabhsimran Singh, who narrowly missed out on a century against Lucknow Super Giants on Sunday. As Prabsimran called his ailing father after his 48-ball 91, the message he received was that the batter threw his wicket away after getting so close to a century.
Prabhsimran's father, Sardar Surjit Singh, isn't going through the best of times, needing to get dialysis done three times a week. In such complicated times, Prabhsimran's performances for PBKS on the pitch have somehow managed to bring a smile back on Surjit Singh's face.
""The only time he smiles these days is when he sees Prabhsimran bat in the IPL,"" Surjit Singh's brother Satwinderpal Singh told theTimes of India.
""He is going through dialysis thrice a week. As an elder brother, I can't see the pain he is enduring. I have to step out of the house when the doctors come home for the dialysis. Not a day has gone by that I have not prayed that it should not be my younger brother,"" said Satwinderpal Singh, who has worked as a mentor for Prabhsimran along with his own sonsAnmolpreet SinghandTejpreet Singh.

While Prabhsimran is ruling the roost all across the country with his bat, his father and uncle enjoy his performances by sitting in front of the television in Patiala. In fact, when Surjit sees his son Prabhsimran hit a rash shot, he shouts in front of the TV, saying he should play cautiously.
""Before every Punjab Kings match, I carry him to the living room. We watch the match together, and every time the camera is on Simmu, he smiles. If Simmu scores, he keeps on smiling and laughing. In those moments, he forgets the pain he is in. If Simmu plays a rash shot, he shouts, 'khotte aaram naal khel (play sensibly).'""
When Prabsimran called his father after the 91-run knock against Lucknow, he was scolded by Surjit for not completing the ton.
""Simmu video called on Monday morning to take an update about Surjit. And my brother gave him back by saying why he threw away his wicket after getting so close to the hundred,"" said Satwinderpal with a laugh.
""While shouting at Simmu, he gasps for breath. Every time I have to intervene and tell him to praise the kid, because he is playing so well.""

After the trio ofMitchell Marsh,Aiden Markram, andNicholas Pooranfell early, the onus was on Pant,Ayush Badoni, and other middle-order batters to resurrect the team's position in the chase of 237 runs against Punjab. But, LSG could only reach 199/7, despite Badoni's 40-ball 74. Once again this season, Lucknow were let down by their captain, Pant, when they needed him the most, and owner Sanjiv Goenka's reaction summed up the feeling in the dugout.

A fighting half-century by Ayush Badoni and his 81-run stand with Abdul Samad was the only highlight as LSG suffered a 37-run loss to PBKS after a top-order failure at the HPCA stadium in Dharmasala. Had skipper Pant shown more patience in the middle, things could've ended differently for the Super Giants.
Sanjiv Goenka, who has developed a reputation as a hard taskmaster after multiple on-field confrontations with his captains, was understandably not pleased to see Pant depart early. The wicket-keeper batter was bought by Goenka for a record fee of INR 27 crore in the mega auction last year. So far, it's fair to say, the money's worth hasn't been received.

After the game, Pant blamed the team's poor fielding as the reason behind the defeat.
""Definitely too many runs. When you're gonna drop crucial catches at the wrong time, it is going to hurt you badly. We thought it was going to do more. We didn't pick the length right at the start. That's part and parcel of the game. The dream is still alive. If we're gonna win the next three matches, we definitely can turn it around.
""It makes sense when your top order is batting really well. In every match, you can't hope they will come off nicely. It's part of the game. We need to take the game deep. Every time, they can't do the heavy job for us. Like you said in the first, we had too many to chase. That hurt us badly,"" Rishabh Pant said in the post-match presentation ceremony.

Sharma was able to break the shackles by depositing leg-spinnerZeeshan Ansarifor a couple of sixes over long-on in the 15th over.

Bedi was on the verge of making his IPL debut during CSK's last match against Royal Challengers Bengaluru. He was named in the playing XI but picked up the injury moments before the game and was replaced by Deepak Hooda. With Bedi ruled out of the season, CSK moved quickly to bring in Urvil Patel.

Urvil, 26, represents Gujarat in domestic cricket. He gained nationwide attention during the 2024-25 Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy when he smashed the joint-fastest T20 century by an Indian batter — a blistering 28-ball ton against Tripura. That innings helped him cement his place as one of the most exciting uncapped talents in the country.
Urvil had a memorable campaign in that edition of the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy. He scored 315 runs in 6 matches, including two centuries, at an average of over 78 and a strike rate nearing 230. His attacking approach at the top of the order and wicketkeeping skills make him a valuable addition to any T20 side.
Overall, Urvil Patel has played 47 T20s, scoring 1162 runs with two hundreds and four fifties. He was also part of the Gujarat Titans squad in IPL 2023, although he did not get a chance to play.
He joins CSK for his base price of Rs 30 lakh and becomes the third player this season to join the team as an injury replacement. Earlier, CSK brought in 17-year-old Mumbai opener Ayush Mhatre as a replacement for injured captain Ruturaj Gaikwad, who could play only five games this season. Later, South Africa's Dewald Brevis was added to the squad as a replacement for pacer Gurjapneet Singh.
Chennai Super Kings have had a difficult season, both on and off the field. With just two wins from 11 games, they are at the bottom of the IPL 2025 points table and have already been knocked out of the playoffs race. With three matches still to play, the team will look to test its bench strength and possibly give Urvil Patel his maiden IPL cap before the season ends.",2025-05-06 01:43:24,Positive

The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) is reportedly displeased with the coach's recent press conference remarks, compounding the scrutiny already mounting over his controversial team methods. According to a report, though Gambhir has the board's backing at present, things could change quickly if India's T20 World Cup 2026 performances at home are affected
Following the crushing defeat, Gambhir's post-match press conference has become a focal point of contention. While publicly accepting collective responsibility, the coach's defiant stance and his perceived attempt to shift blame or offer contradictions have not gone down well with the BCCI hierarchy.
According to a report in theHindustan Times, Gambhir's forthright comments, particularly on the pitch conditions after the Kolkata Test, were seen as adding unnecessary fuel to the fire. The report suggests the Board is unhappy with the tone and content of his public statements, adding a layer of off-field drama to the team's on-field slump.
As the public sentiment increasingly turns against Gambhir, the head coach doesn't have a lot of time before the board turns its back on him, too.
India's Test record, especially at home, has been the primary concern for the top bosses. Under Gambhir's leadership, the team has suffered multiple home series defeats, an unthinkable scenario for Indian cricket under Gambhir's predecessors likeRahul DravidandRavi Shastri.
A major point of criticism from former players and experts is Gambhir's over-reliance on all-rounders/part-timers at the expense of specialist batters and bowlers. This tactical approach is believed to have sacrificed stability and depth, undermining the foundation required for success in the five-day format.
The pressure from dismal performances in the red-ball format is rising on Gambhir, and it won't be long before he loses the backing he currently has. India are not scheduled to play a home Test series until August 2026, hence, the BCCI is not keen to dismiss the coach from the Test format just yet.
Gambhir's success as the team's white-ball coach does play a role in the confidence the BCCI has in him. But the coach needs to keep the pendulum swinging in the T20 World Cup, too.",2025-11-28 20:32:50,Positive

India's sweeping 0-2 home series defeat against South Africa has opened Pandora's box, with questions being raised over the selection committee and team management's decision to force veterans likeRohit Sharma,Virat Kohli, andRavichandran Ashwinout of the team. Ashwin himself feels the trio could've stayed for a longer time and helped the team with a smooth transition. But India's batting legendSunil Gavaskarisn't entirely on board with the theory.
Ashwin, in a video on his YouTube channel, hinted that the case with him, Kohli, and Rohit was that they lacked clarity over their future. The clouds of uncertainty, hence, pushed them towards taking the harsh decision and retiring from the longest format. Ashwin, for the matter of fact, retired mid-series on the Border-Gavaskar Trophy tour of Australia.
""There must be a certain pathway for transition. When there is no clarity, it becomes an individualistic decision. Virat could have groomed players. Rohit could have done that. I could have done that. I have always spoken about the importance of knowledge transfer. It has never been our strength,"" Ashwin said in a video on hisYouTubechannel.
Adding to Ashwin's sentiments, many fans feel that the results in the home Test series against South Africa could've been different if the likes of Rohit and Kohli were still with the team. But, Gavaskar doesn't think so.
Gavaskar, an iconic batter in Indian cricket, feels Kohli, Rohit, and Ashwin's decision to retire was their own; the blame can't be put on the management. Gavaskar also referred to India's 0-3 series defeat against Australia when all three of them were part of the team, saying their presence couldn't rescue India then. Hence, there's no certainty that they would've done so against South Africa at home.
""No, the call to take retirements must have been their call. Probably, they might have been asked to consider their future. But we can't say that had they been here, we would have won. They were there when we lost to New Zealand. What happened when they were there? We lost 0-3, no? Then what happened in Australia? We should not be thinking on these lines. No, we can't be thinking about whether we pushed them to retirement. That is the wrong way to approach this,"" Gavaskar said onAajtak.
While Ashwin has quit all three formats, talks of Rohit and Kohli being moved on from ODI cricket have been buzzing for a while now. However, the results against South Africa in the Test series could see those suggestions calming down.",2025-11-28 20:32:51,Positive

But, little did the fans of cricket's richest league know that spending a 'record-breaking' fee of Rs 27 crore would become one of the biggest reasons behind Lucknow Super Giants' early elimination from the T20 league. Pant shattered all records as the Sanjiv Goenka-led franchise splashed an eye-watering sum to avail the wicket-keeper batter's services. Cometh the 18th edition of the IPL, the management even decided to hand over the captaincy responsibilities to Pant.
In the 12 matches that LSG have played so far this season, Pant has had the opportunity to bat in 11. Barring a solitary half-century in the match against the Chennai Super Kings, which too came in a losing cause, Pant couldn't even cross the 25-run mark in the other 10 games.
Pant made quite a few bizarre decisions over the course of 11 outings for LSG this season, one of which saw him even come out to bat at the No. 7 spot. The result was a Golden Duck, which was followed by an incessant flow of trolling on social media.
In the match against the Sunrisers, Pant made the bold call of demotingNicholas Pooran, arguably the team's most fearsome hitter, by one spot to play himself at the No. 3 position. Even this stunt didn't produce the results the skipper wanted, as he was dismissed without even getting into a double-digit score.
Some dressing room scenes even hinted at a conflict between the team's support staff and the skipper over certain on-field decisions. Confusion and a lack of clarity over the affairs of the team could be clearly seen.
Rishabh Pant's IPL 2025 Stats (after 12 matches):
Rishabh Pant In IPL 2025 (Match-By-Match):
Tom Moody, an IPL-winner with the Sunrisers Hyderabad, feels the fact that LSG spent a combined sum of Rs 48 crore on the duo of Rishabh Pant and Nicholas Pooran played a significant role in the team's inability to build a strong bowling attack. The balance of the team, skewed in the process, was hit significantly.
""The expense on Rishabh Pant and Nicholas Pooran, those two players, makes it very hard to build a very strong bowling unit. Because you just don't have the funds to compete at the auction table,"" Moody said in a panel discussion on ESPNCricinfo.
""In an ideal world, it's great to have Pooran, (David) Miller, (Mitchell) Marsh, Pant... all these are impactful batters, but at the end of the day, you need to bowl. You've got to be able to have an impactful bowling unit in powerplays. Be adaptable in the middle overs and take wickets, and squeeze the opposition. And in the back-end of the innings, you need people to close the game under pressure - take wickets, bowl those really challenging overs when the opposition is going hell-for-leather against you. And I just don't think they've got any of that.""
The core responsibilities of a management are to build a balanced squad that is capable of performing as a unit, not just individually. As the LSG management put its head into auction preparations, the balance was fundamentally ignored.
Having already spent Rs 21 crore for Pooran, Lucknow shouldn't have gone as far as Rs 27 crore for Pant. But, the bosses gave in to the lure of signing arguably the most coveted Indian player in the market.
Though money spent doesn't directly transform into performances, a player of Pant's calibre was expected to deliver a lot more than he has. The manner in which the 2025 season has ended for LSG doesn't raise question marks over the franchise's plans for the next year, especially the fact that the bosses have Pant in their plans or not.",2025-11-28 20:32:56,Positive
