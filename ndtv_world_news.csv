US President Donald Trump said on Friday that the administration will strip Harvard University of its tax exempt status.
""We are going to be taking away Harvard's Tax Exempt Status. It's what they deserve!"" Trump said in a post on his social media platform.
On Tuesday, the Ivy League University released its long awaited internal probe report on campus antisemitism, which showed that latter harboured a hostile environment towards Jews, Israelis and Muslims.
“I am sorry for the moments when we failed to meet the high expectations we rightfully set for our community,” Harvard's interim president Alan Garbar said in a statement.This move comes amid Trump administration freezing $2.2 billion in multiyear federal grants over Harvard's refusal to help stamp out alleged antisemitism and hate in the university campus.
Harvard had responded by earlier by saying that the removal of its tax exempt status would jeopardise critical research, its educational mission and reduce financial aid for students.

US Vice President JD Vance said on Thursday that he hopes India will respond to Pakistan over the terror attack in Jammu and Kashmir that killed 26 - in a way that would avoid a ""broader regional conflict"". He also urged Pakistan to cooperate with India to ""hunt down"" the terrorists involved in the attack in Pahalgam.
""Our hope here is that India responds to this terrorist attack in a way that doesn't lead to a broader regional conflict.

Last month, he called Prime Minister Narendra Modi and strongly condemned the terror attack and conveyed his deepest condolences on the loss of lives. He also expressed that the US stands with the people of India and is ready to provide all assistance in the joint fight against terrorism, Ministry of External Affairs spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said in a post on X.

Many top US leaders, including President Donald Trump, condemned the attack, calling it ""terror"" and ""unconscionable"". They have also expressed their support for India without directly blaming Pakistan.
Twenty-six people, including one Nepali national, were killed and many others were injured as multiple terrorists descended on Baisaran Valley, known as ""Mini Switzerland"" - a tourist hotspot with rolling hills and verdant orchards - and opened fire last week. According to eyewitnesses, as the gunshots rang out, there was panic among the tourists who ran for cover. However, there was no place for them to hide in the wide, open space.
Security forces have launched search operations to track down the terrorists involved in the attack. While India has taken strict action against Pakistan by suspending the decades-old Indus Waters Treaty indefinitely and sending all Pakistani nationals back.
The attack has been one of the biggest terror attacks after the abrogation of Article 370 in 2019.

Celebrities like MrBeast and Elon Musk weighed in, and even the White House used the meme for commentary on immigration policy.
The internet is abuzz with a peculiar question: could 100 unarmed men take down a single adult male gorilla in a fight? Thedebatewas sparked by X user Michael Sherrills on April 24, and it has since snowballed into a full-blown phenomenon, captivating the attention of celebrities and politicians alike.YouTube star MrBeast poked fun at the idea, posting a fake thumbnail titled ""100 Men vs. a Gorilla"" and jokingly asking for volunteers. Elon Musk said: ""Sure, what's the worst that could happen?""
Even the White House got in on the action, using the meme to make a pointed commentary on immigration. Their post featured a photo of immigrants boarding a plane with an image of President Donald Trump, captioned: ""100 men vs 1 gorilla is still up for debate. Meanwhile, 142,000+ illegal alien criminals went up against 1 President Trump - They all got deported.""

The White House's post seemed to endorse Trump's hardline immigration record. According to ICE, during Trump's initial 100 days in office, 66,463 people were detained without proper documentation, and 65,682 were deported.
Michael Sherrills, the man behind the original question, expressed surprise at the frenzy his query sparked and he toldNBC, ""The thing people love the most is things that probably won't ever happen, because you can debate about it,"" he said. ""It's like tasting a dream, you know what I'm saying? And I think people love to feel it out."" Sherrills remains confident that 100 men could defeat a gorilla, but with some caveats. ""I can do it, but I got to be in the last batch, and I have to be able to pick the other 99 people,"" he said. ""We're gonna have to call a couple of wrestlers, some football players probably.""

Fanjoy's positive campaign, door-knocking, and Poilievre's perceived absence led to this significant win.
In a stunning upset, Bruce Fanjoy, a stay-at-home dad and Liberal candidate, has defeated Pierre Poilievre, the leader of the Conservative Party, in the Carleton electoral district, with over 4,300 votes. This remarkable victory not only marked the end of Poilievre's 20-year tenure as the MP for Carleton but also dealt a significant blow to his bid for prime minister.
Fanjoy's campaign was built on a foundation of positivity and hard work. ""We ran a positive campaign, in remarkable contrast to Pierre's style of politics,"" he toldPolitico Magazine. ""We attracted a small army of volunteers, and as the campaign carried on, more and more people believed in what we were doing."" Fanjoy's dedication to his constituents was evident in his door-knocking efforts, which began in 2023. ""I wore through two pairs of sneakers and a pair of boots,"" he recalled.
The turning point in the campaign came when Donald Trump's threats against Canada began to escalate. ""There was a sea change in what I was hearing at the doors,"" Fanjoy said. ""Canadians recognised we were facing another U.S. administration led by Donald Trump and some of his hostile rhetoric toward Canada, our economy, and our political sovereignty."" This shift in public opinion, combined with Poilievre's perceived absence from the riding, ultimately sealed his fate.
Fanjoy attributed his success to his team's tireless efforts and Poilievre's complacency. ""We outworked him,"" he said. ""We were present, we were all over the riding, and we were connecting with voters. People appreciated the fact that we were present and that we offered a positive alternative to Pierre."" Fanjoy also noted that Poilievre's absence from the riding was a significant factor in his defeat. ""If there was one surprise that I had in this campaign in Carleton, it's that Pierre barely showed up,"" he said. ""After all his time as MP, he took the riding for granted, and nobody likes to be taken for granted.""
As a first-time politician, Fanjoy remains committed to his values and principles. ""I know who I am, and I'm going to be true to my values,"" he said. ""I grew up playing competitive sports, I had a career in the private sector, so I understand what it's like to compete."" Fanjoy's victory is seen as a referendum on Poilievre's leadership style and a rejection of his conservative ideology. ""The result is very clear that Canadians want responsible leadership,"" Fanjoy said. ""They want serious leadership, and this is no time to be flirting with the kind of politics that we're seeing down to the south.""
With the Liberal Party now forming a minority government, Fanjoy expects the party to govern with principle and in the best interests of Canadians. ""We'll govern with principle, we'll govern in the best interests of Canadians,"" he said. ""This Liberal government is filled with people who are committed to their communities and committed to this country.""

He aims to advise President Trump part-time post his term expiry in May. Despite stepping back, he believes DOGE can thrive independently.
Elon Musk, the head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) will be minimising his work in the government, and he's embracing his role as a visionary leader, likening himself to Buddha, perThe Washington Post. When asked who would succeed him, Musk replied, ""Is Buddha needed for Buddhism? Was it not stronger after he passed away?""Musk's departure from DOGE is necessitated by his limited term as a special government employee, which expires in May. Despite this, he expressed his willingness to continue contributing to the government on a part-time basis. ""I'm willing to contribute on average, one to two days a week... as long as the president wants me to do it,"" Musk said. He envisions dedicating a few days each month to advising President Donald Trump and the Vice President. ""Obviously, if the president or the Cabinet has an emergency that they want me to respond to, then I'll do that,"" Musk added.
As Musk refocuses on his business ventures, including Tesla, X, and Starlink, speculation surrounds his successor. Recently, Tesla's board allegedly sought executive search firms to identify potential candidates for a possible leadership transition. Musk swiftly responded to the report, labeling it ""deliberately false"" and a ""breach of ethics.""
Despite stepping back from DOGE, Musk remains committed to the initiative, describing it as ""a way of life... like Buddhism."" He claims DOGE has achieved $160 billion in estimated savings and aims to reach $1 trillion. According to Musk, the DOGE's success is not solely dependent on his leadership. ""DOGE is kind of a way of life... we make converts all the time,"" he said, expressing confidence in the team's ability to sustain momentum.
Musk's working relationship with Trump appears to be informal and friendly, with the billionaire often staying overnight at the White House. ""The president is - I guess we're good friends,"" Musk said. Trump has even offered Musk the Lincoln Bedroom, complete with a tour of its history. The two have also shared late-night ice cream invitations. ""He'll actually call, like, late at night and say, 'Oh, by the way, make sure you get some ice cream from the kitchen,'"" Musk said.
He spoke about gaining three pounds in one night. ""It was epic. I mean, don't tell RFK,"" he said, referencing Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. He also recalled how he played video games such as Diablo and “Pathfinder” on a large computer monitor in his West Wing office.
In a candid conversation, Musk shared his thoughts on the DOGE's office space, describing it as ""comically tiny"" with a view of the HVAC unit. ""It's harder to shoot me there... there's not a good line of sight,"" he joked.
Musk remains optimistic about DOGE's prospects, believing it can endure without his direct involvement. With around 100 employees currently working on DOGE, Musk is confident that the initiative will continue to make progress, possibly for the duration of Trump's second term.
But he also spoke about the hardships of working at DOGE. ""It's like 60 percent fun, 70 percent fun. Depends on the week,"" he said. ""Being attacked relentlessly is not super fun. Seeing cars burning is not fun."" He compared the department to a ""start-up"", saying ""things have been very intense"".

Notable wins included Ruby Sahota and Anita Anand, while NDP leader Jagmeet Singh lost his seat.
The 2025 Canadian federal elections have marked a historic milestone for the Punjabi community, with a record 22 candidates of Punjabi origin securing seats in the House of Commons. This impressive representation accounts for over 6% of Canada's parliament, showcasing the growing influence of the Punjabi diaspora in the country's politics.
In Brampton, a city known for its strong Punjabi presence, the election results were particularly noteworthy. Five constituencies in Brampton featured candidates with Punjabi names. Ruby Sahota, a Liberal, defeated Amandeep Judge, a Conservative, in Brampton North, while Maninder Siddhu, a Liberal, beat Bob Dosanjh, a Conservative, in Brampton East and Sonia Siddhu, a Liberal defeated Sukhdeep Kang, a Conservative, in Brampton South.
Beyond Brampton, other Punjabi Canadian politicians made significant wins. Anita Anand, a former innovation minister, retained her seat in Oakville East, while Bardish Chagger, a veteran politician known for her work on diversity and inclusion, secured a win in Waterloo. Other Liberal winners included Anju Dhillon, Sukh Dhaliwal, Randeep Sarai, and Param Bains. The Conservative Party also saw success with candidates of Punjabi origin, including Jasraj Hallan, Dalwinder Gill, Amanpreet Gill, Arpan Khanna, Tim Uppal, Parm Gill, Sukhman Gill, Jagsharan Singh Mahal and Harb Gill.
However, not all prominent Punjabi politicians fared well. Jagmeet Singh, the leader of the New Democratic Party (NDP), lost his seat in Burnaby Central, finishing third and subsequently resigning as NDP president. This unexpected outcome has sent shockwaves through Canada's political landscape.
The success of Punjabi Canadians in the 2025 elections reflects the growing clout of the Indian diaspora, particularly the Punjabi Sikh community, in shaping policies in one of the world's most progressive democracies.

This was Laura Coleman-Day's 13th marathon this year. The woman from Lincolnshire, England, raised money to support a cancer charity and in the memory of her husband Xander.
Ms Coleman-Day's husband Xander died in 2024 due to complications following a transplant he required after being diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, a rare form of cancer that affects the bone marrow and blood, theBBCreported.
The 33-year-old completed the marathon alongside her Guernsey-based friend Kate Walford, who is also doing several marathons in memory of her best friend who died from leukaemia in 2018.
She described finishing the marathon on her wedding anniversary as ""absolutely amazing"" after running the final three miles wearing the dress.
On her sixth wedding anniversary, Ms Coleman-Day stopped running for a time in the 23rd mile of the 26.2-mile marathon to put on the wedding gown so she could wear it to the end of the marathon.
""I thought that going overboard with my wedding gown would be the ideal way to honour the day and Xander,"" Ms Coleman-Day told BBC News.
""Kate and I are going to stop at mile 23 and put my wedding dress on,"" she added,Peoplereported.
She claimed it was ""hot"" to finish the race wearing the outfit, but she did it with Ms Walford. ""It was absolutely amazing,"" Ms Coleman-Day said.
Ms Coleman-Day married Xander, a Royal Air Force aerospace battle manager, in 2019. The two had a son, Amos, a few years later.
Mr Xander began complaining of aches and pains, and physicians diagnosed him with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) by 2022, she told local outletLincolnshire Live.
He was deemed cancer-free in December 2022 but had a relapse shortly after receiving treatment.
Despite his optimism, the cancer eventually claimed Mr Xander's life in February 2024 at the age of 36. Their son was two years old at the time.
Ms Coleman-Day ran the London Marathon to raise money for Anthony Nolan, a charity which works in the fields of leukaemia and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.

Why US Cars Are A Rare Sight In Japan,"Fri, 02 May 2025 12:56:30 +0530","With their sleek curves and chrome grilles, the classic American cars on sale at Yosuke Fukuda's yard ooze Californian cool but on Japanese roads new US vehicles are a rare sight -- much to President Donald Trump's annoyance.
Japan's Toyota is the second-top-selling automaker in the United States, where it shifted more than 2.3 million vehicles last year.
Meanwhile US industry leader General Motors sold just 587 Chevrolets and 449 Cadillacs in Japan, while Ford pulled out of the tough Japanese market nearly a decade ago.
And it's not just an aversion to foreign brands -- in 2024 Mercedes-Benz sold more than 53,000 vehicles and BMW sold over 52,000 including Minis.
""They don't take our cars, but we take MILLIONS of theirs!"" Trump said in April, accusing Japan of treating its ally ""very poorly on trade"".
To try and rev up the US auto industry, Trump has imposed a 25 percent levy on imported vehicles, in a major blow to Tokyo.
Many people in Japan admire vintage US cars, but when it comes to new wheels, they hold more trust in domestic brands, Fukuda told AFP.
West Coast hip-hop booms out at his shop Y-Tech, an incongruous slice of Americana amid the rice paddies north of Tokyo.
""To be honest I think the problem is the size of the roads,"" as well as an impression that US cars break down more often, which is likely unfounded, Fukuda said.
At his garage, the 20 or so classic US models in varying states of restoration include a silver-green 1970 Chevrolet Nova and a 1954 Buick Roadmaster.
But Fukuda also drives a modern SUV -- a General Motors Yukon, which is two metres (6.5 feet) wide and ""sticks out or is packed in"" when parked in Tokyo's narrow streets.
Although some US cars are smaller, the brands remain a niche choice because ""there are hardly any places that sell them or repair them"", he said.
Yuka Fujimoto, a 42-year-old modelling agency manager, told AFP she had never considered buying a US car.
""American cars don't sell very well"" in Japan, where domestic automakers offer ""a wide range of line-ups including for families"", she said.
However Trump believes Japan is keeping out American cars with ""non-tariff cheating"".
This includes ""Protective Technical Standards (Japan's bowling ball test)"" he wrote last month on Truth Social.
""They take a bowling ball from 20 feet up in the air and they drop it on the hood of the car. And if the hood dents, then the car doesn't qualify,"" Trump reportedly elaborated in 2018.
A Japanese transport ministry official in charge of safety standards told AFP that no actual bowling balls are used.
Trump ""may be mixing it up with a test where a hemispherical human head model is hit on the hood"", the official said.
But the car's bonnet is in fact required to dent to absorb the impact, he explained.
Tweaking Japan's vehicle import procedures is a potential bargaining chip for Tokyo in tariff talks with Washington.
The country could offer to widen access to a simplified screening process which currently applies to 5,000 vehicles per model annually, Japanese media reports said.
Trump's auto tariffs have already brought some changes, with Nissan last month revising plans to reduce US production.
Meanwhile Honda is moving production of its hybrid Civic model from Japan to the United States, saying no ""single issue"" had prompted the decision.
But US carmakers still face the problem of tepid demand among Japanese consumers.
Hisashi Uchida, a 56-year-old construction firm employee, said his Toyota car ""doesn't have any special features, but it doesn't break down"".
""Many American cars can't be parked at multi-storey parking lots, and their fuel efficiency isn't good,"" he said.
Overall ""I don't think US carmakers are really putting importance on the Japanese market, which is significantly smaller than their home market"", said Masamitsu Misawa, chief editor of Japanese vehicle magazine Car Top.
In contrast, German car brands offer a better range and their designs ""better match Japanese people's tastes"", he told AFP.
Cars in Japan drive on the left, and unlike US rivals European automakers usually put the steering wheel on the correct side for vehicles sold there, he added.
That could be changing. General Motors' 8th-generation Chevrolet Corvette has right-hand drive in Japan for the first time.
""I think that reflects efforts (for selling in Japan) by manufacturers and importers,"" Misawa said.

The statement came in response to the US government's latest claims that the virus likely leaked from a lab in Wuhan, China.
China hit back, accusing the US of ""shamelessly politicising"" the virus' origins.
In a white paper, Chinese officials said, ""Substantial evidence suggested the Covid-19 might have emerged in the United States earlier than its officially-claimed timeline, and earlier than the outbreak in China."" The paper also focused on Beijing's long-standing position that a lab leak is ""extremely unlikely,"" citing a joint World Health Organization (WHO)-China study.
""The US government, instead of facing squarely its failure in response to COVID-19 and reflecting on its shortcomings, has tried to shift the blame and divert people's attention by shamelessly politicising SARS-CoV-2 origins tracing,"" the Chinese government said. The US should not ""pretend to be deaf and dumb,"" they said.
The white paper alleged Washington evaded responsibility and attempted to distract from its mishandling of the pandemic. ""The US should cease from shifting blame and evading responsibility, stop finding external excuses for its internal malaise, and genuinely reflect on and overhaul its public health policies,"" the document read. ""The US cannot continue to turn a deaf ear to the numerous questions over its conduct,"" they said, as perFox News.
The strongly worded document followed the White House's decision earlier this month to revamp its COVID.gov website. The updated site pushes the theory that COVID-19 leaked from the Wuhan Institute of Virology, describes it as the ""most likely"" origin, and criticises former US officials such as Dr Anthony Fauci and former President Joe Biden.
""A lab-related incident involving gain-of-function research is most likely the origin of COVID-19,"" reads the updated White House section. It also asserts that current oversight of such research is ""incomplete, severely convoluted, and lack[s] global applicability.""
The new US stance cites biological features in the virus that allegedly don't occur in nature and suggests that if a natural origin were true, evidence would have surfaced by now. The website also references a past lawsuit that resulted in a $24 billion judgment against China for allegedly hoarding protective gear and covering up the early outbreak, as perCNN.
Earlier this year, the CIA shifted its assessment, saying the pandemic most likely started in a lab, though the agency said it was ""low confidence"". In its conclusion, it said both lab and natural origins remain plausible.
An official from China's National Health Commission added that the next phase of COVID-19 origin tracing should focus on the US.

Many top US leaders, including President Donald Trump, condemned the attack, calling it ""terror"" and ""unconscionable"". They have also expressed their support for India without directly blaming Pakistan.
Twenty-six people, including one Nepali national, were killed and many others were injured as multiple terrorists descended on Baisaran Valley, known as ""Mini Switzerland"" - a tourist hotspot with rolling hills and verdant orchards - and opened fire last week. According to eyewitnesses, as the gunshots rang out, there was panic among the tourists who ran for cover. However, there was no place for them to hide in the wide, open space.
Security forces have launched search operations to track down the terrorists involved in the attack. While India has taken strict action against Pakistan by suspending the decades-old Indus Waters Treaty indefinitely and sending all Pakistani nationals back.
The attack has been one of the biggest terror attacks after the abrogation of Article 370 in 2019.

Celebrities like MrBeast and Elon Musk weighed in, and even the White House used the meme for commentary on immigration policy.
The internet is abuzz with a peculiar question: could 100 unarmed men take down a single adult male gorilla in a fight? Thedebatewas sparked by X user Michael Sherrills on April 24, and it has since snowballed into a full-blown phenomenon, captivating the attention of celebrities and politicians alike.YouTube star MrBeast poked fun at the idea, posting a fake thumbnail titled ""100 Men vs. a Gorilla"" and jokingly asking for volunteers. Elon Musk said: ""Sure, what's the worst that could happen?""
Even the White House got in on the action, using the meme to make a pointed commentary on immigration. Their post featured a photo of immigrants boarding a plane with an image of President Donald Trump, captioned: ""100 men vs 1 gorilla is still up for debate. Meanwhile, 142,000+ illegal alien criminals went up against 1 President Trump - They all got deported.""
100 men vs 1 gorilla is still up for debate.Meanwhile, 142,000+ illegal alien criminals went up against 1 President Trump —They all got deported. 🤭pic.twitter.com/2LaXNC3IEG
The White House's post seemed to endorse Trump's hardline immigration record. According to ICE, during Trump's initial 100 days in office, 66,463 people were detained without proper documentation, and 65,682 were deported.
Michael Sherrills, the man behind the original question, expressed surprise at the frenzy his query sparked and he toldNBC, ""The thing people love the most is things that probably won't ever happen, because you can debate about it,"" he said. ""It's like tasting a dream, you know what I'm saying? And I think people love to feel it out."" Sherrills remains confident that 100 men could defeat a gorilla, but with some caveats. ""I can do it, but I got to be in the last batch, and I have to be able to pick the other 99 people,"" he said. ""We're gonna have to call a couple of wrestlers, some football players probably.""

Fanjoy's positive campaign, door-knocking, and Poilievre's perceived absence led to this significant win.
In a stunning upset, Bruce Fanjoy, a stay-at-home dad and Liberal candidate, has defeated Pierre Poilievre, the leader of the Conservative Party, in the Carleton electoral district, with over 4,300 votes. This remarkable victory not only marked the end of Poilievre's 20-year tenure as the MP for Carleton but also dealt a significant blow to his bid for prime minister.
Fanjoy's campaign was built on a foundation of positivity and hard work. ""We ran a positive campaign, in remarkable contrast to Pierre's style of politics,"" he toldPolitico Magazine. ""We attracted a small army of volunteers, and as the campaign carried on, more and more people believed in what we were doing."" Fanjoy's dedication to his constituents was evident in his door-knocking efforts, which began in 2023. ""I wore through two pairs of sneakers and a pair of boots,"" he recalled.
The turning point in the campaign came when Donald Trump's threats against Canada began to escalate. ""There was a sea change in what I was hearing at the doors,"" Fanjoy said. ""Canadians recognised we were facing another U.S. administration led by Donald Trump and some of his hostile rhetoric toward Canada, our economy, and our political sovereignty."" This shift in public opinion, combined with Poilievre's perceived absence from the riding, ultimately sealed his fate.
Fanjoy attributed his success to his team's tireless efforts and Poilievre's complacency. ""We outworked him,"" he said. ""We were present, we were all over the riding, and we were connecting with voters. People appreciated the fact that we were present and that we offered a positive alternative to Pierre."" Fanjoy also noted that Poilievre's absence from the riding was a significant factor in his defeat. ""If there was one surprise that I had in this campaign in Carleton, it's that Pierre barely showed up,"" he said. ""After all his time as MP, he took the riding for granted, and nobody likes to be taken for granted.""
As a first-time politician, Fanjoy remains committed to his values and principles. ""I know who I am, and I'm going to be true to my values,"" he said. ""I grew up playing competitive sports, I had a career in the private sector, so I understand what it's like to compete."" Fanjoy's victory is seen as a referendum on Poilievre's leadership style and a rejection of his conservative ideology. ""The result is very clear that Canadians want responsible leadership,"" Fanjoy said. ""They want serious leadership, and this is no time to be flirting with the kind of politics that we're seeing down to the south.""
With the Liberal Party now forming a minority government, Fanjoy expects the party to govern with principle and in the best interests of Canadians. ""We'll govern with principle, we'll govern in the best interests of Canadians,"" he said. ""This Liberal government is filled with people who are committed to their communities and committed to this country.""

He aims to advise President Trump part-time post his term expiry in May. Despite stepping back, he believes DOGE can thrive independently.
Elon Musk, the head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) will be minimising his work in the government, and he's embracing his role as a visionary leader, likening himself to Buddha, perThe Washington Post. When asked who would succeed him, Musk replied, ""Is Buddha needed for Buddhism? Was it not stronger after he passed away?""Musk's departure from DOGE is necessitated by his limited term as a special government employee, which expires in May. Despite this, he expressed his willingness to continue contributing to the government on a part-time basis. ""I'm willing to contribute on average, one to two days a week... as long as the president wants me to do it,"" Musk said. He envisions dedicating a few days each month to advising President Donald Trump and the Vice President. ""Obviously, if the president or the Cabinet has an emergency that they want me to respond to, then I'll do that,"" Musk added.
As Musk refocuses on his business ventures, including Tesla, X, and Starlink, speculation surrounds his successor. Recently, Tesla's board allegedly sought executive search firms to identify potential candidates for a possible leadership transition. Musk swiftly responded to the report, labeling it ""deliberately false"" and a ""breach of ethics.""
Despite stepping back from DOGE, Musk remains committed to the initiative, describing it as ""a way of life... like Buddhism."" He claims DOGE has achieved $160 billion in estimated savings and aims to reach $1 trillion. According to Musk, the DOGE's success is not solely dependent on his leadership. ""DOGE is kind of a way of life... we make converts all the time,"" he said, expressing confidence in the team's ability to sustain momentum.
Musk's working relationship with Trump appears to be informal and friendly, with the billionaire often staying overnight at the White House. ""The president is - I guess we're good friends,"" Musk said. Trump has even offered Musk the Lincoln Bedroom, complete with a tour of its history. The two have also shared late-night ice cream invitations. ""He'll actually call, like, late at night and say, 'Oh, by the way, make sure you get some ice cream from the kitchen,'"" Musk said.
He spoke about gaining three pounds in one night. ""It was epic. I mean, don't tell RFK,"" he said, referencing Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. He also recalled how he played video games such as Diablo and “Pathfinder” on a large computer monitor in his West Wing office.
In a candid conversation, Musk shared his thoughts on the DOGE's office space, describing it as ""comically tiny"" with a view of the HVAC unit. ""It's harder to shoot me there... there's not a good line of sight,"" he joked.
Musk remains optimistic about DOGE's prospects, believing it can endure without his direct involvement. With around 100 employees currently working on DOGE, Musk is confident that the initiative will continue to make progress, possibly for the duration of Trump's second term.
But he also spoke about the hardships of working at DOGE. ""It's like 60 percent fun, 70 percent fun. Depends on the week,"" he said. ""Being attacked relentlessly is not super fun. Seeing cars burning is not fun."" He compared the department to a ""start-up"", saying ""things have been very intense"".

Notable wins included Ruby Sahota and Anita Anand, while NDP leader Jagmeet Singh lost his seat.
The 2025 Canadian federal elections have marked a historic milestone for the Punjabi community, with a record 22 candidates of Punjabi origin securing seats in the House of Commons. This impressive representation accounts for over 6% of Canada's parliament, showcasing the growing influence of the Punjabi diaspora in the country's politics.
In Brampton, a city known for its strong Punjabi presence, the election results were particularly noteworthy. Five constituencies in Brampton featured candidates with Punjabi names. Ruby Sahota, a Liberal, defeated Amandeep Judge, a Conservative, in Brampton North, while Maninder Siddhu, a Liberal, beat Bob Dosanjh, a Conservative, in Brampton East and Sonia Siddhu, a Liberal defeated Sukhdeep Kang, a Conservative, in Brampton South.
Beyond Brampton, other Punjabi Canadian politicians made significant wins. Anita Anand, a former innovation minister, retained her seat in Oakville East, while Bardish Chagger, a veteran politician known for her work on diversity and inclusion, secured a win in Waterloo. Other Liberal winners included Anju Dhillon, Sukh Dhaliwal, Randeep Sarai, and Param Bains. The Conservative Party also saw success with candidates of Punjabi origin, including Jasraj Hallan, Dalwinder Gill, Amanpreet Gill, Arpan Khanna, Tim Uppal, Parm Gill, Sukhman Gill, Jagsharan Singh Mahal and Harb Gill.
However, not all prominent Punjabi politicians fared well. Jagmeet Singh, the leader of the New Democratic Party (NDP), lost his seat in Burnaby Central, finishing third and subsequently resigning as NDP president. This unexpected outcome has sent shockwaves through Canada's political landscape.
The success of Punjabi Canadians in the 2025 elections reflects the growing clout of the Indian diaspora, particularly the Punjabi Sikh community, in shaping policies in one of the world's most progressive democracies.

This was Laura Coleman-Day's 13th marathon this year. The woman from Lincolnshire, England, raised money to support a cancer charity and in the memory of her husband Xander.
Ms Coleman-Day's husband Xander died in 2024 due to complications following a transplant he required after being diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, a rare form of cancer that affects the bone marrow and blood, theBBCreported.
The 33-year-old completed the marathon alongside her Guernsey-based friend Kate Walford, who is also doing several marathons in memory of her best friend who died from leukaemia in 2018.
She described finishing the marathon on her wedding anniversary as ""absolutely amazing"" after running the final three miles wearing the dress.
On her sixth wedding anniversary, Ms Coleman-Day stopped running for a time in the 23rd mile of the 26.2-mile marathon to put on the wedding gown so she could wear it to the end of the marathon.
""I thought that going overboard with my wedding gown would be the ideal way to honour the day and Xander,"" Ms Coleman-Day told BBC News.
""Kate and I are going to stop at mile 23 and put my wedding dress on,"" she added,Peoplereported.
She claimed it was ""hot"" to finish the race wearing the outfit, but she did it with Ms Walford. ""It was absolutely amazing,"" Ms Coleman-Day said.
Ms Coleman-Day married Xander, a Royal Air Force aerospace battle manager, in 2019. The two had a son, Amos, a few years later.
Mr Xander began complaining of aches and pains, and physicians diagnosed him with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) by 2022, she told local outletLincolnshire Live.
He was deemed cancer-free in December 2022 but had a relapse shortly after receiving treatment.
Despite his optimism, the cancer eventually claimed Mr Xander's life in February 2024 at the age of 36. Their son was two years old at the time.
Ms Coleman-Day ran the London Marathon to raise money for Anthony Nolan, a charity which works in the fields of leukaemia and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.

Why US Cars Are A Rare Sight In Japan,"Fri, 02 May 2025 12:56:30 +0530","With their sleek curves and chrome grilles, the classic American cars on sale at Yosuke Fukuda's yard ooze Californian cool but on Japanese roads new US vehicles are a rare sight -- much to President Donald Trump's annoyance.
Japan's Toyota is the second-top-selling automaker in the United States, where it shifted more than 2.3 million vehicles last year.
Meanwhile US industry leader General Motors sold just 587 Chevrolets and 449 Cadillacs in Japan, while Ford pulled out of the tough Japanese market nearly a decade ago.
And it's not just an aversion to foreign brands -- in 2024 Mercedes-Benz sold more than 53,000 vehicles and BMW sold over 52,000 including Minis.
""They don't take our cars, but we take MILLIONS of theirs!"" Trump said in April, accusing Japan of treating its ally ""very poorly on trade"".
To try and rev up the US auto industry, Trump has imposed a 25 percent levy on imported vehicles, in a major blow to Tokyo.
Many people in Japan admire vintage US cars, but when it comes to new wheels, they hold more trust in domestic brands, Fukuda told AFP.
West Coast hip-hop booms out at his shop Y-Tech, an incongruous slice of Americana amid the rice paddies north of Tokyo.
""To be honest I think the problem is the size of the roads,"" as well as an impression that US cars break down more often, which is likely unfounded, Fukuda said.
At his garage, the 20 or so classic US models in varying states of restoration include a silver-green 1970 Chevrolet Nova and a 1954 Buick Roadmaster.
But Fukuda also drives a modern SUV -- a General Motors Yukon, which is two metres (6.5 feet) wide and ""sticks out or is packed in"" when parked in Tokyo's narrow streets.
Although some US cars are smaller, the brands remain a niche choice because ""there are hardly any places that sell them or repair them"", he said.
Yuka Fujimoto, a 42-year-old modelling agency manager, told AFP she had never considered buying a US car.
""American cars don't sell very well"" in Japan, where domestic automakers offer ""a wide range of line-ups including for families"", she said.
However Trump believes Japan is keeping out American cars with ""non-tariff cheating"".
This includes ""Protective Technical Standards (Japan's bowling ball test)"" he wrote last month on Truth Social.
""They take a bowling ball from 20 feet up in the air and they drop it on the hood of the car. And if the hood dents, then the car doesn't qualify,"" Trump reportedly elaborated in 2018.
A Japanese transport ministry official in charge of safety standards told AFP that no actual bowling balls are used.
Trump ""may be mixing it up with a test where a hemispherical human head model is hit on the hood"", the official said.
But the car's bonnet is in fact required to dent to absorb the impact, he explained.
Tweaking Japan's vehicle import procedures is a potential bargaining chip for Tokyo in tariff talks with Washington.
The country could offer to widen access to a simplified screening process which currently applies to 5,000 vehicles per model annually, Japanese media reports said.
Trump's auto tariffs have already brought some changes, with Nissan last month revising plans to reduce US production.
Meanwhile Honda is moving production of its hybrid Civic model from Japan to the United States, saying no ""single issue"" had prompted the decision.
But US carmakers still face the problem of tepid demand among Japanese consumers.
Hisashi Uchida, a 56-year-old construction firm employee, said his Toyota car ""doesn't have any special features, but it doesn't break down"".
""Many American cars can't be parked at multi-storey parking lots, and their fuel efficiency isn't good,"" he said.
Overall ""I don't think US carmakers are really putting importance on the Japanese market, which is significantly smaller than their home market"", said Masamitsu Misawa, chief editor of Japanese vehicle magazine Car Top.
In contrast, German car brands offer a better range and their designs ""better match Japanese people's tastes"", he told AFP.
Cars in Japan drive on the left, and unlike US rivals European automakers usually put the steering wheel on the correct side for vehicles sold there, he added.
That could be changing. General Motors' 8th-generation Chevrolet Corvette has right-hand drive in Japan for the first time.
""I think that reflects efforts (for selling in Japan) by manufacturers and importers,"" Misawa said.

The statement came in response to the US government's latest claims that the virus likely leaked from a lab in Wuhan, China.
China hit back, accusing the US of ""shamelessly politicising"" the virus' origins.
In a white paper, Chinese officials said, ""Substantial evidence suggested the Covid-19 might have emerged in the United States earlier than its officially-claimed timeline, and earlier than the outbreak in China."" The paper also focused on Beijing's long-standing position that a lab leak is ""extremely unlikely,"" citing a joint World Health Organization (WHO)-China study.
""The US government, instead of facing squarely its failure in response to COVID-19 and reflecting on its shortcomings, has tried to shift the blame and divert people's attention by shamelessly politicising SARS-CoV-2 origins tracing,"" the Chinese government said. The US should not ""pretend to be deaf and dumb,"" they said.
The white paper alleged Washington evaded responsibility and attempted to distract from its mishandling of the pandemic. ""The US should cease from shifting blame and evading responsibility, stop finding external excuses for its internal malaise, and genuinely reflect on and overhaul its public health policies,"" the document read. ""The US cannot continue to turn a deaf ear to the numerous questions over its conduct,"" they said, as perFox News.
The strongly worded document followed the White House's decision earlier this month to revamp its COVID.gov website. The updated site pushes the theory that COVID-19 leaked from the Wuhan Institute of Virology, describes it as the ""most likely"" origin, and criticises former US officials such as Dr Anthony Fauci and former President Joe Biden.
""A lab-related incident involving gain-of-function research is most likely the origin of COVID-19,"" reads the updated White House section. It also asserts that current oversight of such research is ""incomplete, severely convoluted, and lack[s] global applicability.""
The new US stance cites biological features in the virus that allegedly don't occur in nature and suggests that if a natural origin were true, evidence would have surfaced by now. The website also references a past lawsuit that resulted in a $24 billion judgment against China for allegedly hoarding protective gear and covering up the early outbreak, as perCNN.
Earlier this year, the CIA shifted its assessment, saying the pandemic most likely started in a lab, though the agency said it was ""low confidence"". In its conclusion, it said both lab and natural origins remain plausible.
An official from China's National Health Commission added that the next phase of COVID-19 origin tracing should focus on the US.

A democracy sausage is a cultural tradition as Australian as koalas, vegemite and TimTams.

The sausage is also a way for aspiring leaders to show that they are humble enough to eat a cheap piece of meat wrapped in bread, and photographs of politicians eating these democracy sausages have become memes, and generally a part of Australian political folklore.

Moreover, the Australian constitution does not mention anything about a dress code for voting, and it has become a tradition to vote in swimwear. This started when the maker of ""Budgie Smuggler"" was giving out free swimming trunks to the first 200 people who voted in smugglers.

Voting in Australia for the national election began on Saturday. Per polls, voter appetite for change has been dampened by US tariffs, and hence the elections might favour Labour Prime Minister Anthony Albanese over conservative challenger Peter Dutton.

This follows a scandal where former adviser Mike Waltz included a journalist in a sensitive chat. Trump has since replaced Waltz.
Newly surfaced photographs from a recent Donald Trump cabinet meeting have raised eyebrows, revealing top White House officials using a modified, less secure version of the Signal messaging app, per a report by theGuardian.
The images, captured by Reuters, show Mike Waltz, the former national security adviser, using the TM SGNL app, which allows message retention and archiving. This development comes on the heels of a national security scandal last month, where Waltz accidentally included a journalist in a sensitive group chat discussing operational plans to bomb Yemen, which were then carried out the same way as described.
The TM SGNL app, created by TeleMessage, clones popular messaging apps with added archiving capabilities. According to 404 Media, this function may compromise the end-to-end encryption that makes Signal a trusted platform for private communications. It's likely that White House officials are using this modified app to comply with the legal requirement to preserve presidential records.
The photographs show Waltz exchanging messages with high-profile contacts, including Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, and Steve Witkoff, the president's special envoy to the Middle East. Some of the messages are visible, with one to Rubio reading ""there is time"" and a message from “Vance” stating, ""I have confirmation from my counterpart it's turned off. He is going to be here in …"". There's also an indication that Waltz used Signal to call Gabbard and had an 8am meeting scheduled for “PDB”, probably the president's daily brief.
In response to the controversy, a White House spokesperson defended the use of Signal, telling the Washington Post “As we have said many times, Signal is an approved app for government use and is loaded on government phones.” Meanwhile, Trump removed Waltz from his position as national security adviser on Thursday, replacing him with Rubio on an interim basis, and appointed Waltz as the UN ambassador.

This follows a scandal where former adviser Mike Waltz included a journalist in a sensitive chat. Trump has since replaced Waltz.
Newly surfaced photographs from a recent Donald Trump cabinet meeting have raised eyebrows, revealing top White House officials using a modified, less secure version of the Signal messaging app, per a report by theGuardian.
The images, captured by Reuters, show Mike Waltz, the former national security adviser, using the TM SGNL app, which allows message retention and archiving. This development comes on the heels of a national security scandal last month, where Waltz accidentally included a journalist in a sensitive group chat discussing operational plans to bomb Yemen, which were then carried out the same way as described.
The TM SGNL app, created by TeleMessage, clones popular messaging apps with added archiving capabilities. According to 404 Media, this function may compromise the end-to-end encryption that makes Signal a trusted platform for private communications. It's likely that White House officials are using this modified app to comply with the legal requirement to preserve presidential records.
The photographs show Waltz exchanging messages with high-profile contacts, including Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, and Steve Witkoff, the president's special envoy to the Middle East. Some of the messages are visible, with one to Rubio reading ""there is time"" and a message from “Vance” stating, ""I have confirmation from my counterpart it's turned off. He is going to be here in …"". There's also an indication that Waltz used Signal to call Gabbard and had an 8am meeting scheduled for “PDB”, probably the president's daily brief.
In response to the controversy, a White House spokesperson defended the use of Signal, telling the Washington Post “As we have said many times, Signal is an approved app for government use and is loaded on government phones.” Meanwhile, Trump removed Waltz from his position as national security adviser on Thursday, replacing him with Rubio on an interim basis, and appointed Waltz as the UN ambassador.

Evidently, the images are of people or entities whose actions or viewpoints the US President Donald Trump and his administration disagree with.
Let's take a look at each of the four images:
1) Kamala Harris
The first photo features US Vice President Kamala Harris, with a text overlay that read, “Not President.”
The timing of this post is significant, coming shortly after Ms Harris' first major speech since losing the US Presidential elections in November 2024.
In her speech a couple of days ago, she criticised Donald Trump. She described the US President's economic policies, particularly his sweeping tariffs, as the catalyst for what she labelled the “greatest man-made economic crisis” in modern history, reportedCNN.
She also warned that Donald Trump's ongoing conflicts with the judiciary were pushing the nation towards a constitutional crisis.
2) Kilmar Abrego Garcia
The next image highlights Kilmar Abrego Garcia, with the text “Not a ‘Maryland Man'"".
Mr Garcia, a father of three, was living in Maryland when he was deported to El Salvador, a decision that has sparked controversy.
The Donald Trump administration said that Mr Garcia was a member of the violent MS-13 gang. Garcia's family and legal representatives dispute these accusations, maintaining that he is innocent with no criminal convictions in the US. He is currently being held in a prison, while his family continues to fight for his return.
3) NPR
The next image shows the NPR logo, with the text “Not real news"". This reference stems from President Donald Trump's executive order signed on May 1, which sought to reduce public subsidies for NPR.
Mr Trump accused the network of bias and propagating “radical, woke propaganda disguised as ‘news,'” reported news agencyReuters.
The executive order directed the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and other federal agencies to cease federal funding for NPR and PBS, as well as to eliminate indirect sources of taxpayer funding.
4) Gulf of Mexico
Thefinal imageshows a water body on a map, with the caption “Not Gulf of Mexico"". This section alludes to anexecutive orderissued by President Donald Trump on his first day in office to rename the Gulf of Mexico as the “Gulf of America.”
The order also declared February 9 as “Gulf of America Day"". This act was symbolic of Donald Trump's inclination to assert a more nationalistic and American-centric approach to geographical and cultural identities
Take a look at the post here:
Four simple truths...pic.twitter.com/pFwSn2WS1A
The post stands out for its stark visuals and pointed messaging, clearly targeting individuals and institutions frequently criticised by Donald Trump. Each image appears to reinforce the administration's stance on key figures and issues, aligning with Trump's ongoing narrative since returning to office.

The now-viral picture, which was also shared by the White House on X, was posted by Trump on his Truth Social page.
He can be seen sitting on the coronation chair.
While some social media users found the post funny, others were disappointed. A section of users felt that the post was disrespectful and accused Mr Trump of mocking the death of Pope Francis.

A user commented, ""So is Mockery of Religion okay when [Donald] Trump does it?""

Please MAGA, explain to me how this ""man of faith"" isn't making a complete mockery of the pious.And the shame associated with the FUCKING WHITE HOUSE account re-tweeting this is just beyond the pale.
Calling Donald Trump's action “childish behaviour”, a person stated, “As President of the United States, posting a picture of himself as Pope a few days after the Pope's death is neither funny, nor does it present statesmanship and respectful behaviour. Rather, it shows the boundless arrogance and childish behaviour of a man who believes he is above everything, can get away with anything and is the head of everyone.""

During a rally marking his first 100 days in office, Mr Trump told reporters, ""I'd like to be Pope. That would be my number one choice.""
South Carolina Senator Lindsay Graham stated on X, ""I was excited to hear that President Trump is open to the idea of being the next Pope.""

Pope Francis, 88, died on Easter Monday, April 21, at his residence in the Vatican's Casa Santa Marta.
The new pope will be elected at a conclave that is scheduled to start next week, and will take immediate charge of the Vatican.

In an interview with theBBC, the Duke of Sussex said that he would ""love"" to repair the rift with his family, which he said had broken down over the security issue. ""There have been so many disagreements between myself and some of my family,"" Prince Harry said, but he added that he had now ""forgiven"" them.
""I would love reconciliation with my family. There's no point continuing to fight any more, life is precious,"" said Prince Harry, who said the dispute over his security had ""always been the sticking point,"" per theBBC.
""I don't know how much longer my father has,"" he added. ""He won't speak to me because of this security stuff, but it would be nice to reconcile.""
Notably, the British government downgraded the Duke's security in 2020 after he and Meghan stepped down as senior royals. On Friday, he lost a court case over his security arrangements.
Saying that he felt ""let down"", Harry described his court defeat as a ""good old-fashioned establishment stitch-up"". He also blamed the Royal Household for influencing the decision to reduce his security.
Speaking about the court ruling, Harry said, ""I'm devastated - not so much as devastated with the loss that I am about the people behind the decision, feeling as though this is okay."" He also stated that the decision to remove his security entitlement impacts him ""every single day"" and has left him in a position where he can only safely return to the UK if invited by the Royal Family, as he would get sufficient security in those circumstances.
""I can't see a world in which I would bring my wife and children back to the UK at this point,"" he told theBBCafter the court defeat.

Reacting to Prince Harry's interview, Buckingham Palace issued a rare statement. ""All of these issues have been examined repeatedly and meticulously by the courts, with the same conclusion reached on each occasion,"" the Royal Palace told the outlet.
On the other hand, the legal team behind the ruling said it would not be appropriate for Harry to have the publicly-paid-for security since shirking his royal duties.
Harry's wife Meghan Markle, and their children, Archie and Lilibet, have not been to the UK since the Prince left the Royal Family for Los Angeles in 2020.

The videos, which are just over two minutes long and are presented in Mandarin with Chinese subtitles, represent a major shift in the CIA's approach to hiring officials in China.
The US views China as its main military and strategic adversary.
One of the videos portrays the internal turmoil of a high-ranking Chinese Communist Party official. The video shows the official is haunted by the growing unpredictability of Chinese President Xi Jinping's sweeping anti-corruption drive.
“As I rise within the party, I watch those above me being discarded like worn-out shoes, but now I realise that my fate was just as precarious as theirs,” the narrator reflects, accompanied by visuals of surveillance and hushed anxiety.
The other video is about a young government employee disillusioned by the stark gap between the party's promises and the lived reality of common citizens. The protagonist toils through bureaucratic drudgery and late nights, only to return to a cramped apartment shared with his parents.
“From a young age, the party taught us that as long as we diligently followed the path laid out by our leaders, we would have a bright future,” the narrator laments.
Both narratives culminate with the characters reaching out to the CIA through its secure online platform — an invitation introduced by the agency last year through a simple text video. That previous effort provided step-by-step instructions in Chinese for contacting the agency. It formed part of a broader campaign to gather intelligence from hard-to-penetrate countries like China, Iran and North Korea.
Both videos can be found on YouTube and are titled in Chinese. One is called, “Why I contacted the CIA: to take control of my fate,” and the other is titled, “Why I contacted the CIA: for a better life.”
Watch the videos here:
These videos reflect a more aggressive push in CIA's outreach initiatives. It shows the agency's conviction that, in spite of strict internet regulations, its messaging is effectively reaching audiences within China.
“If it weren't working, we wouldn't be making more videos,”Reutersquoted a CIA official as saying.
The official said that the US was not just interested in counterintelligence, but was also seeking information on advanced science, military and cyber technology, valuable economic data, and China's foreign policy secrets.
China has not officially responded to the campaign.

The missile reportedly bypassed four layers of air defence and hit a grove adjacent to an access road within the airport's perimeter--one of the country's most sensitive zones-- creating a 25-meter deep crater.
Israel Defence Forces (IDF) said their several attempts to intercept the missile failed before it landed near the airport, sending a plume of smoke into the air. However, a direct hit on terminal infrastructure was averted, yet it caused panic among passengers in the terminal building.
At least eight people were injured in the attack, Magen David Adom (MDA), Israel's national emergency service, said.
The military released a video of the aftermath of the strike showing officers standing at the edge of a crater in an orchard, with the airport's control tower visible in the distance.

Yair Hezroni, the police's central district chief, can be heard saying in the video that ""you can see the area just behind us: a crater was formed here, several dozen metres (yards) wide and several dozen metres deep"".
Meanwhile, authorities have also launched a full-scale investigation into the breach of Israel's air defence and the missile's impact site near one of the country's most sensitive zones.

Israel has an elaborate system of air defences to counter missiles and drones. Known as Iron Dome, the system is designed to intercept short-range rockets, as well as shells and mortars, at ranges of between 4km and 70km from the missile launcher.
Following the missile strike, Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz issued a stark warning: ""Whoever harms us, we will strike them sevenfold.""
So far, Israel has refrained from launching retaliatory strikes on Yemen despite a series of Houthi attacks, as the United States leads a broader military campaign against the Iran-backed group.
Houthi leaders hailed the attack as a demonstration of their long-range strike capability.
Senior Houthi official Mohammed al-Bukhaiti told Al-Araby TV that his group has ""no red lines"" in its confrontation with Israel and emphasised their ability to hit sensitive Israeli targets, The Times of Israel reported.
Additionally, Houthi media chief Nasser al-Din Omar issued a warning to international airlines against flying to or from Israel, claiming such operations jeopardised aircraft safety.

Iran-backed Houthi rebels have claimed responsibility for the attack, saying it demonstrated their ability to strike sensitive targets in Israel.
The missile struck near Israel's biggest airport after multiple interception attempts by the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) failed, prompting a temporary halt in all takeoffs and landings at the country's main international airport. Around an hour after the strike, the Israel Airport Authority said the airspace was reopened and flight operations resumed.
Local media said though a direct hit on terminal infrastructure was averted, the missile impacted a grove adjacent to an access road within the airport's perimeter.

Nasser al-Din Omar, media head for the Houthis, also reportedly warned the airlines against operations in Israel, saying it endangers the safety of their aircraft.
Palestinian group Hamas also praised the 'precision' strike by Yemen's Huthis on the Israeli airport.
Israel Probing Incident
The Israeli Air Force's aerial defence units are now probing the reasons behind the unsuccessful interceptions of the missile fired by Houthis that breached Israel's air defence near one of the country's most sensitive zones.
Magen David Adom (MDA), Israel's national emergency service, reported that eight people were injured in the attack.
The Iran-backed Huthi rebels, who control swathes of Yemen, have launched missiles and drones targeting Israel and Red Sea shipping throughout the Gaza war, saying they are acting in solidarity with Palestinians. On Saturday, the Huthis claimed a third missile attack on Israel in two days.
The vast majority of missiles fired by the Huthis since the start of the Gaza war in 2023 have been intercepted by Israeli air defences. The Yemeni rebels had paused their attacks during a recent two-month ceasefire in the Gaza war.
But in March, they threatened to resume attacks on international shipping over Israel's aid blockade on the Gaza Strip.
The move triggered a response from the US military, which began hammering the rebels with near-daily air strikes starting March 15 in a bid to keep them from threatening shipping in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden. US strikes on the rebels began under former president Joe Biden, but intensified under his successor Donald Trump. Since March, the United States says it has struck more than 1,000 targets in Yemen.

Speaking in an interview with Russian broadcaster RT on Saturday, Muhammad Khalid Jamali, Pakistan's top diplomat in Moscow, said Islamabad has credible intelligence suggesting that India is planning military strikes on Pakistani territory. ""There are some other leaked documents whereby it has been decided to strike certain areas of Pakistan,"" Mr Jamali said. ""So that makes us feel that this is going to happen and it's imminent.""
The comments represent one of the most explicit threats of nuclear retaliation made by a senior Pakistani official against India in recent years. ""We in Pakistan will use the full spectrum of power, both conventional and nuclear,"" he said.
❗️NUCLEAR warning from Pakistan to IndiaDiplomat says Islamabad could use NUKES in case of war with New Delhi‘Pakistan will use full spectrum of power, BOTH conventional and nuclear' — ambassador to Russia tells RThttps://t.co/iTQWdWRQlZpic.twitter.com/LcQXKbIjD0
Mr Jamali's warning follows the April 22 terror attack in Jammu and Kashmir's Pahalgam, in which 26 people, mostly tourists, were killed. The incident has heightened tensions between the two nuclear-armed neighbours. India has accused Pakistan of harbouring and extending support to terror groups who orchestrated the attack, although Islamabad has denied involvement.
In retaliatory measures, India suspended the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT), a 1960 agreement brokered by the World Bank that governs the distribution of the Indus River and its tributaries between the two countries. This treaty had endured through multiple wars between India and Pakistan and was long viewed as a rare stabilising arrangement in a tense bilateral relationship.
Mr Jamali termed India's suspension of the treaty as an act of war.
""Any attempt to usurp the water of the lower riparian, or to stop it, or to divert it would be an act of war against Pakistan and would be responded to with full force of power, including full spectrum of power,"" he said.
The warning follows Pakistan's Defence Minister Khawaja Asif remark on Friday during an interview with Geo News, declaring that Islamabad would target any infrastructure India builds on the Indus River in violation of the treaty. ""Certainly, if they attempt to build any kind of structure, we will strike it,"" Mr Asif said. ""Aggression is not just about firing cannons or bullets; it has many faces. One of those faces is [blocking or diverting water], which could lead to deaths due to hunger and thirst,"" he added.
Amid talks of nuclear action, Pakistan's military conducted a test launch of the Abdali surface-to-surface missile on Saturday. The weapon has a range of 450 kilometres and is capable of carrying both conventional and nuclear payloads. According to a statement from the Pakistani army, the launch was intended to ensure ""operational readiness"".
The Indian government sees the test as a grave provocation, said sources. There has been no official statement from the Ministry of External Affairs on the test.
On Saturday, India imposed a ban on imports of goods originating in or transiting through Pakistan, and it prohibited Pakistani ships from entering Indian ports. This move was accompanied by instructions to Indian carriers not to call at Pakistani ports. Pakistan reciprocated within hours, announcing its own restrictions on Indian vessels.
The Directorate General of Shipping also issued a directive prohibiting maritime commerce between the two nations. The ban extends to all Pakistani goods, including those routed through third countries. Bilateral trade has been virtually frozen since 2019, when India imposed a 200 per cent tariff following the Pulwama attack.
Other measures announced in recent days include the suspension of postal exchanges, including parcels and letters sent via air or surface transport, and the closure of the Attari-Wagah land border crossing.

The massive 105.6 carat stone--one of the largest cut diamonds in the world-- was held by rulers in India before landing in the hands of the East India Company from Maharaja Ranjit Singh's treasury and then being presented to Queen Victoria following the annexation of Punjab. It remains a symbol of British colonial loot and imperialism.
""We've been talking between the UK and India for quite some time about the way that we think we can collaborate much more closely together to make sure that people both in the UK and in India can benefit from and have access to many of the cultural artefacts that stem back to the very different era. This is something that I've discussed with my counterpart,"" Ms Nandy, who is in New Delhi on an official visit, told news agency ANI.

Stressing that the UK's relationship with India is ""very long"" and ""very deep"", she confirmed that her trip also marked the signing of a new cultural cooperation agreement between both nations.
""Across the creative industries, the UK and India really excel, whether it's film, fashion, TV, music, gaming. We're really good at these things, and we export many of those products to the world, but we know that through cooperation, we can do more and we can achieve more together. Our Science museums group has been working with the National Museum Science Museums group here to get joint collaborations, joint exhibitions, tour different objects, make sure that people in India and the UK can really benefit from that. We think that's the model for how we can cooperate much more closely across all the other creative industries as well,"" she said.
The British minister also met Foreign Minister S Jaishankar during her India visit. Talking about her meeting, she said, ""We were very pleased to have a bilateral meeting to discuss how we can cooperate much more closely.""
""Prime Minister Modi has signalled his personal commitment to taking what is already a huge Indian success story through film, fashion, and their wider creative industries and really putting rocket boosters under them for the coming years. Our Prime Minister, Sir Keir Starmer, very much agrees with him. That is exactly what the UK government is trying to do, and we have a lot of ambition for what India and the UK can achieve together,' she added.
She also condoled the terror attack in Jammu and Kashmir's Pahalgam and said the United Kingdom stands with the people of India against terrorism.
""Our Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, was very pleased to be able to send his condolences directly to Prime Minister Modi and to send our condolences to the families of the victims of these appalling attacks. The UK stands with India against terrorism, always in whatever form. We know the Indian nation is hurting because of those attacks, and our relationship with India is very long and very deep,"" Ms Nandy said
"" When you're hurting, we're hurting, and I was pleased to be able to join in that minute's silence to show our respect and our support for India's fight against terrorism,"" she added.

His Labor Party dealt a crushing defeat to its conservative opposition, which was thrown into further disarray when leader Peter Dutton lost a seat he has held for 24 years.
Here are five takeaways from Saturday's vote.
US President Donald Trump's trade tariffs, and the chaos they unleashed, may not have been the biggest factor in the Labor Party victory -- but they helped.
Dutton vowed to slash the civil service, clamp down on immigration, and said he would not stand before an Aboriginal flag.
The harshest critics likened Dutton's offering to that of a ""Temu Trump"", an unflattering reference to the popular website offering cut-price unbranded goods.
""If we want to understand why a good chunk of the electorate has changed across the election campaign over the last couple of months, I think that's the biggest thing,"" said Henry Maher, a politics lecturer at the University of Sydney.
From South Africa to the United States, voters have in recent times turfed out a string of established governments in a global backlash dubbed the ""incumbency curse"".
With inflation biting, and populist parties seemingly on the rise elsewhere, many wondered whether Albanese's government would meet a similar fate.
Instead, Australians rewarded his steady-as-she-goes leadership style, choosing political stability in a time of global upheaval.
Dutton's US$200 billion promise to introduce atomic power to Australia for the first time has imploded.
The opposition leader was hounded on the campaign trail for not visiting any of the seven sites where he proposed to build industrial-scale nuclear reactors.
His nuclear dream included ramping up gas production, slowing the rollout of solar and wind projects, and ditching the clean energy goals set by Albanese's centre-left government.
""This was an energy referendum. Nuclear bombed at the ballot with Australians dubbing it toxic,"" said Amanda McKenzie, chief executive of clean energy advocate the Climate Council.
Dutton's Liberal-National coalition crashed to one of its worst-ever defeats, losing a string of seats once considered conservative strongholds.
With Dutton turfed from his own seat of Dickson -- an electorate he has held for 24 years -- the coalition will lick its wounds with no leader in place.
Notably, Dutton's opposition failed to win back a string of seats claimed by the so-called ""teal"" movement in 2022.
The teals -- a loose-knit group of political novices pushing for climate action -- held on to their inner-city seats despite a targeted conservative campaign.
Most opinion polls picked the winner -- but few hinted at the scale of the Labor landslide.
""This was beyond even our most optimistic expectations. It was a history-making night. It was one for the ages,"" Treasurer Jim Chalmers said Sunday.
Most polls pointed towards a Labor government -- but were split on whether Albanese would command a slim majority, or cobble together a coalition.
Instead, Labor is on course to win at least 82 seats in the 150-member parliament, partial results showed, easily ahead of the 76 needed for majority rule.

https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/lawrence-wongs-party-secures-landslide-victory-in-singapore-general-election-8323453#pfrom=home-ndtvworld_world_top_scroll,Lawrence Wong's Party Secures Landslide Victory In Singapore General Election,"Sun, 04 May 2025 00:57:33 +0530","Lawrence Wong, 52, was sworn-in last May as the new prime minister in 20 years.
Prime Minister Lawrence Wong's People's Action Party (PAP) won the Singapore General Election Saturday by a landslide, securing 87 of the 97 parliamentary seats, local media reported.
Mr Wong and the PAP had sought a new mandate from the general election in the midst of uncertainties to the global economy caused by the US trade tariffs.
The PAP, Singapore's oldest and largest political party, has ruled the city-state ever since independence in 1965.
About 2.6 million Singaporeans were eligible to vote on Saturday for 92 contested seats as the PAP's Group Representation Constituency for Marine Parade-Braddell Heights had a walkover on nomination day on April 23.
This was Mr Wong's first election as prime minister of the global-business focused Singapore which now faces navigating through strong headwinds caused by tariffs imposed by US President Donald Trump.
Speaking after the result for Marsiling-Yew Tee Group Representation Constituency (GRC) was announced, Wong said the election was his first and a “humbling experience”. He pledged to work hard for the voters.
“We are grateful for your strong mandate and… will honour the trust that you have given to us by working even harder for all of you,” said the 52-year-old premier.
The Elections Department (ELD) said Singaporeans cast their votes for 92 out of 97 parliamentary seats at 1,240 polling stations island-wide to decide the future politics of Singapore.
This was Singapore's 19th election since the first general election in 1948 and 14th since its Independence in 1965.
Mr Wong, 52, was sworn-in last May as the new prime minister in 20 years after Lee Hsien Loong stepped down after almost two decades.
There was vociferous campaigning by opposition political parties, raising issues related to high cost of living and housing as well as increasing presence of foreigners in almost all sectors of the economy in the manpower-short Singapore.
Top PAP leaders were seen balancing their election schedules during the last nine days of campaigning since nominations closed on April 23 along with negotiating tariffs imposed by Singapore's largest trading partner US.
Singapore's Deputy Prime Minister and Trade and Industry Minister Gan Kim Yong had been negotiating with his US counterparts on a 10 per cent tariff imposed on imports from Singapore.
The PAP fielded candidates in all 92 constituencies, while its main rival, the Workers' Party (WP), contested 26 seats in eight constituencies.
The Progress Singapore Party (PSP) fielded 13 candidates across six constituencies. Other parties in the fray included the Singapore People's Party (SPP), Singapore Democratic Party (SDP), People's Power Party (PPP), People's Alliance for Reform (PAR), Red Dot United (RDU), National Solidarity Party (NSP), Singapore United Party (SUP), and Singapore Democratic Alliance (SDA).
Prime Minister Wong had urged Singaporeans to vote responsibly as the global economies are going through unprecedented challenges and led to uncertainties.
The finance-trade-export focused city state sits in the middle of US-China trade war, having historical bilateral economic and diplomatic relations with both the giant markets, diplomatic sources said.
Manufacturing activity in Singapore fell into recession territory in April 2025 as tariffs announced by US President Donald Trump triggered a wave of export-order deferments and cancellations.
The purchasing managers' index (PMI), a barometer of the manufacturing sector's health, fell to 49.6 points in April, down one point from 50.6 in March; readings above 50 indicate growth while those below point to contraction.
“The contraction in Singapore's factory activity snaps 19 straight months of expansion,” reported The Straits Times, citing a Singapore Institute of Purchasing and Materials Management (SIPMM) report on Friday.
Meanwhile, the PAP had a walkover in one constituency of five members of parliament at the close of nomination day on April 23.
The PAP's share of the popular vote slipped to a near-record low of 61 per cent in 2020 elections, down from nearly 70 per cent in 2015 and although it kept 83 out of 93 parliamentary seats, the opposition gained ground with a record 10 seats. PTI GS OZ SCY NPK GSP GSP

The video, titled ""Lo-fi MAGA Video to Relax/Study To,"" was streamed live across the Trump administration's official YouTube and X channels.
Lo-Fi MAGA Video to Relax/Study To ????????Have a great weekend!https://t.co/IrKPU2i4i7
The video features calming, low-fidelity beats commonly used for background study or work music. Accompanying the audio was an animation of Trump at the Resolute Desk signing documents, alongside a continuous scroll of text highlighting key campaign promises and actions labelled ""Promises made, promises kept.""
The text scroll listed several of the administration's recent actions, including executive orders aimed at eliminating diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programs in the military and policies targeting birthright citizenship for children of undocumented immigrants.
According to a White House official the 15-minute clip will loop throughout the weekend across digital platforms to explore ""innovative ways to distribute fact sheets and other information.""
The video wraps up a week-long campaign by the White House to spotlight what it says are Trump's key achievements in the first 100 days of his second term. Among the highlights were a newly launched ""White House Wire"" section on the official website modelled after the conservative Drudge Report, a round of ""new media"" briefings led by press secretary Karoline Leavitt, and over 100 interviews granted to conservative influencers and podcasters.
This media push came during a rough week for the administration, marked by the ouster of National Security Adviser Mike Waltz following the ""Signalgate"" scandal, as perUS media.
The controversy erupted when Waltz took full responsibility for inadvertently adding journalist Jeffrey Goldberg to aSignal group chatdiscussing classified military operations in Yemen.
In his first 100 days of his second term, Donald Trump took swift and controversial actions.
He declared a national emergency at the southern border, deployed troops, ended birthright citizenship for undocumented immigrants, and signed the Laken Riley Act to crack down on undocumented crime.
He issued executive orders to dismantle DEI programmes, withdraw from the World Health Organization, and declassify JFK assassination files. Trump also reintroduced tariffs on China, Canada, and Mexico, leading to trade tensions, and cut funding to the US cybersecurity agency (CISA).
He pardoned over 1,500 people tied to the January 6 Capitol attack and Ross Ulbricht, the Silk Road founder. He appointed Elon Musk to lead a new Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) and rolled back federal regulations.

However, the situation quickly turned deadly.
A fully-grown female crocodile, named Lalay, charged towards the man, sinking her fangs deep into his arm. Horrified onlookers screamed as the crocodile clamped her jaws around his arm, and then grabbed his thigh, attempting a deadly death roll to tear him apart.
The gruesome attack lasted for 30 minutes, with the tourist trapped in the enclosure. Lalay's handler eventually intervened, using a piece of cement to bash the crocodile on the head, causing her to loosen her grip and freeing the victim. Medics quickly wrapped the visitor's arm and thigh with cloth to control the bleeding before rushing him to the hospital for further treatment. He received more than 50 stitches.
Police officers told local media that the man had climbed into the enclosure because he thought the crocodile was fake.
""The tourist was walking around the area, then he saw the crocodile, which he thought was just a plastic fixture. He climbed the fence and entered the enclosure, and the crocodile attacked him. This kind of behaviour is very dangerous. Nobody should ever enter an animal's enclosure at the zoo. He put other people's lives at risk, and he is very lucky to have survived,"" Police Staff Sergeant Joel Sajolga of the Siay Municipal Police told multiple outlets, per TheDaily Mail.
An investigation into the incident is still ongoing.

The devastated mother, Jeanette Dees, and the relatives of convicted murderer Te'Bryis Robinson, 19, got into an altercation inside the Sedgwick County Courthouse on April 8, KWCH reported.
The altercation started after Ms Dee urged the judge to impose the ""maximum possible sentence"" on her son's killer during her court appearance.
She also insulted Robison and his friends and family present in the courtroom.
The mother's remarks before the sentencing created an uproar in the courtroom, resulting in insults exchanged before the first blow was delivered.
A member of Ms Dees' family was seen getting up from his seat and punching one of Robinson's relatives in the face.
This led to a brawl between the two families in the centre of the courtroom.
The District Attorney's office charged Ms Dees with one count of disorderly conduct and a $500 fine, the Sedgwick County Sheriff's Office confirmed.
Others who have been charged with disorderly conduct were Trerntasia Hutton, Derrick Parker, Trentavies Hutton, Trentez Hutton, and a 16-year-old boy.
Before the sentence was delivered, several people were expelled from the courtroom. The judge sentenced Robinson to 21 years and three months in jail for the murder of TrenJ'vious ""Tubby"" Hutton.
In another incident from February, the uncle and stepfather of the accused assaulted a New Mexico murder suspect, Alexander Ortiz, 21, in court.
Ortiz was arrested by Albuquerque police for shooting Alianna Farfan, his ex-girlfriend.
Courtroom video footage showed a man jumping over the barricade separating the public in the courtroom and charging at Ortiz as he tried to escape. Another man followed a few moments later.
A frenzied altercation broke out, with Carlos Lucero, Pete Ysasi, Ortiz, Ortiz's father, a correctional officer, and an anonymous sixth man all grappling on the ground.
Lucero and Ysasi were seen punching a man wearing pants and a dark long-sleeved shirt while the prison guard tried to protect Ortiz.

For the past seven years, Abel has been overseeing Berkshire's BNSF railroad and its treat makers, See's Candies and Dairy Queen, along with dozens of other manufacturing and retail businesses that Buffett acquired over the years.
He grew up in Canada as a hockey player and learned the value of hard work as he redeemed discarded bottles and worked for a small company filling fire extinguishers. Now he finds himself at the top of the food chain in the investment world.
Read:Warren Buffett To Step Down, Greg Abel To Be New Berkshire Hathaway CEO
Berkshire confirmed Abel as Buffett's successor in 2021 after former Vice Chairman Charlie Munger let it slip at the annual meeting. Since then, Abel has largely remained in Buffett's shadow, although shareholders have had a chance to get to know him a bit when he appeared alongside Buffett at the annual meetings and in interviews.
Berkshire's board will now vote on whether to formally approve Abel as the new CEO to take over at the end of 2025. At the annual meeting in Omaha, Buffett said he expects that to occur by a unanimous vote.
Abel will step forward to take responsibility for all of Berkshire's eclectic assortment of businesses with their nearly 400,000 employees and the conglomerate's massive stock portfolio. Buffett and members of Berkshire's board, who for years have devoted much of their time to finding Buffett's successor, have praised Abel's brilliance and knack for understanding all kinds of businesses.
Buffett once said Berkshire is ""so damn lucky"" to have Abel ready to take over, but he will have trouble coming close to Buffett's remarkable track record of outpacing the market. Whereas Buffett grew Berkshire over the decades by making well-timed deals and stock investments at attractive prices, Berkshire's massive size has made it that much harder lately to find anything big enough to change the conglomerate's bottom line.
Read:Warren Buffett's Best And Worst Investments In Last 60 Years
Abel has big shoes to fill, but no one expects him to match the accomplishments of Buffett, who made him a billionaire many times over and one of the wealthiest investors of the past century. Longtime Berkshire board member Ron Olson said two days before the announcement that he believed Abel was ready to take over.
""Is he another Warren Buffett? No, there is no other Warren Buffett that I know. But he has so many of the fundamentals of Warren,"" Olson said. ""He is for sure high integrity. He is a hard worker. He is a strategic thinker.""
Buffett has said for years that Abel's main job when he becomes CEO will be to preserve Berkshire's unique decentralised culture built on independence, integrity, and trust. In fact, Munger's comment that gave away Abel's future role was that ""Greg will keep the culture.""
Executives at a diverse mix of Berkshire subsidiaries, including sneaker maker Brooks Running, flooring giant Shaw and Borsheims jewelry, have said they all turn to Abel whenever they face tough questions in their businesses related to strategy or operating details, and he's always available when they need him, though he will challenge them.
Read:""Won't Bet On A Currency Going To Hell"": Warren Buffett's Dollar Warning
""When I think about Greg, he not only has high business acumen, but he has really high business instincts,"" Dairy Queen CEO Troy Bader said Friday. ""The intuition is really important. And, you know, Warren has that intuition, but Greg has a lot of it as well.""
Abel has never done many interviews, though he put his detailed business knowledge on display at the Berkshire meetings when discussing utilities and the railroad. But he did offer a glimpse into his background to the Horatio Alger Association when that group honoured him in 2018.
Abel's family-oriented upbringing in Edmonton, Alberta, and lessons in hard work and perseverance were similar to what Buffett learned while working in his grandfather's Omaha grocery store as a kid.
""I think hard work leads to good outcomes. In my schooling, in sports, and in my business positions, I learned that if I put in a lot of work and was well-prepared, then success would be more likely,"" Abel said in 2018.
Abel lives about two hours from Buffett's hometown in Des Moines, Iowa, where he has led Berkshire Hathaway Energy since 2011 and helped coach his kids' hockey and soccer teams. He is expected to continue living there because Berkshire is so decentralised that there is little reason to move to its Omaha headquarters. Buffett only had a couple of dozen people working in his office as he spent his days reading business reports and making the occasional phone call.

The missile reportedly bypassed four layers of air defence and hit a grove adjacent to an access road within the airport's perimeter--one of the country's most sensitive zones-- creating a 25-meter deep crater.
Israel Defence Forces (IDF) said their several attempts to intercept the missile failed before it landed near the airport, sending a plume of smoke into the air. However, a direct hit on terminal infrastructure was averted, yet it caused panic among passengers in the terminal building.
At least eight people were injured in the attack, Magen David Adom (MDA), Israel's national emergency service, said.
The military released a video of the aftermath of the strike showing officers standing at the edge of a crater in an orchard, with the airport's control tower visible in the distance.

Yair Hezroni, the police's central district chief, can be heard saying in the video that ""you can see the area just behind us: a crater was formed here, several dozen metres (yards) wide and several dozen metres deep"".
Meanwhile, authorities have also launched a full-scale investigation into the breach of Israel's air defence and the missile's impact site near one of the country's most sensitive zones.
The Houthi missile hit just 75 meters from Terminal 3 at Ben Gurion Airport, narrowly avoiding a direct strike that could have triggered a full-scale war.This needs a powerful response.pic.twitter.com/ySGvEmnshN
Israel has an elaborate system of air defences to counter missiles and drones. Known as Iron Dome, the system is designed to intercept short-range rockets, as well as shells and mortars, at ranges of between 4km and 70km from the missile launcher.
Following the missile strike, Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz issued a stark warning: ""Whoever harms us, we will strike them sevenfold.""
So far, Israel has refrained from launching retaliatory strikes on Yemen despite a series of Houthi attacks, as the United States leads a broader military campaign against the Iran-backed group.
Houthi leaders hailed the attack as a demonstration of their long-range strike capability.
Senior Houthi official Mohammed al-Bukhaiti told Al-Araby TV that his group has ""no red lines"" in its confrontation with Israel and emphasised their ability to hit sensitive Israeli targets, The Times of Israel reported.
Additionally, Houthi media chief Nasser al-Din Omar issued a warning to international airlines against flying to or from Israel, claiming such operations jeopardised aircraft safety.

Iran-backed Houthi rebels have claimed responsibility for the attack, saying it demonstrated their ability to strike sensitive targets in Israel.
The missile struck near Israel's biggest airport after multiple interception attempts by the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) failed, prompting a temporary halt in all takeoffs and landings at the country's main international airport. Around an hour after the strike, the Israel Airport Authority said the airspace was reopened and flight operations resumed.
Local media said though a direct hit on terminal infrastructure was averted, the missile impacted a grove adjacent to an access road within the airport's perimeter.
Following the strike, Israel's Defence Minister, Israel Katz, in a terse statement, said, ""Whoever harms us, we will strike them sevenfold.""
So far, Israel has refrained from launching retaliatory strikes on Yemen despite a series of Houthi attacks, as the United States leads a broader military campaign against the Iran-backed group.
Meanwhile, Mohammed al-Bukhaiti, a senior official in Yemen's Houthi rebel movement, told the Qatari Al-Araby TV channel that the attack demonstrated their ability to strike sensitive targets in Israel and that the Iran-backed group has ""no red lines"" in its fight against Israel.
Nasser al-Din Omar, media head for the Houthis, also reportedly warned the airlines against operations in Israel, saying it endangers the safety of their aircraft.
Palestinian group Hamas also praised the 'precision' strike by Yemen's Huthis on the Israeli airport.
Israel Probing Incident
The Israeli Air Force's aerial defence units are now probing the reasons behind the unsuccessful interceptions of the missile fired by Houthis that breached Israel's air defence near one of the country's most sensitive zones.
Magen David Adom (MDA), Israel's national emergency service, reported that eight people were injured in the attack.
The Iran-backed Huthi rebels, who control swathes of Yemen, have launched missiles and drones targeting Israel and Red Sea shipping throughout the Gaza war, saying they are acting in solidarity with Palestinians. On Saturday, the Huthis claimed a third missile attack on Israel in two days.
The vast majority of missiles fired by the Huthis since the start of the Gaza war in 2023 have been intercepted by Israeli air defences. The Yemeni rebels had paused their attacks during a recent two-month ceasefire in the Gaza war.
But in March, they threatened to resume attacks on international shipping over Israel's aid blockade on the Gaza Strip.
The move triggered a response from the US military, which began hammering the rebels with near-daily air strikes starting March 15 in a bid to keep them from threatening shipping in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden. US strikes on the rebels began under former president Joe Biden, but intensified under his successor Donald Trump. Since March, the United States says it has struck more than 1,000 targets in Yemen.

Speaking in an interview with Russian broadcaster RT on Saturday, Muhammad Khalid Jamali, Pakistan's top diplomat in Moscow, said Islamabad has credible intelligence suggesting that India is planning military strikes on Pakistani territory. ""There are some other leaked documents whereby it has been decided to strike certain areas of Pakistan,"" Mr Jamali said. ""So that makes us feel that this is going to happen and it's imminent.""
The comments represent one of the most explicit threats of nuclear retaliation made by a senior Pakistani official against India in recent years. ""We in Pakistan will use the full spectrum of power, both conventional and nuclear,"" he said.
❗️NUCLEAR warning from Pakistan to IndiaDiplomat says Islamabad could use NUKES in case of war with New Delhi‘Pakistan will use full spectrum of power, BOTH conventional and nuclear' — ambassador to Russia tells RThttps://t.co/iTQWdWRQlZpic.twitter.com/LcQXKbIjD0
Mr Jamali's warning follows the April 22 terror attack in Jammu and Kashmir's Pahalgam, in which 26 people, mostly tourists, were killed. The incident has heightened tensions between the two nuclear-armed neighbours. India has accused Pakistan of harbouring and extending support to terror groups who orchestrated the attack, although Islamabad has denied involvement.
In retaliatory measures, India suspended the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT), a 1960 agreement brokered by the World Bank that governs the distribution of the Indus River and its tributaries between the two countries. This treaty had endured through multiple wars between India and Pakistan and was long viewed as a rare stabilising arrangement in a tense bilateral relationship.
Mr Jamali termed India's suspension of the treaty as an act of war.
""Any attempt to usurp the water of the lower riparian, or to stop it, or to divert it would be an act of war against Pakistan and would be responded to with full force of power, including full spectrum of power,"" he said.
The warning follows Pakistan's Defence Minister Khawaja Asif remark on Friday during an interview with Geo News, declaring that Islamabad would target any infrastructure India builds on the Indus River in violation of the treaty. ""Certainly, if they attempt to build any kind of structure, we will strike it,"" Mr Asif said. ""Aggression is not just about firing cannons or bullets; it has many faces. One of those faces is [blocking or diverting water], which could lead to deaths due to hunger and thirst,"" he added.
Amid talks of nuclear action, Pakistan's military conducted a test launch of the Abdali surface-to-surface missile on Saturday. The weapon has a range of 450 kilometres and is capable of carrying both conventional and nuclear payloads. According to a statement from the Pakistani army, the launch was intended to ensure ""operational readiness"".
The Indian government sees the test as a grave provocation, said sources. There has been no official statement from the Ministry of External Affairs on the test.
On Saturday, India imposed a ban on imports of goods originating in or transiting through Pakistan, and it prohibited Pakistani ships from entering Indian ports. This move was accompanied by instructions to Indian carriers not to call at Pakistani ports. Pakistan reciprocated within hours, announcing its own restrictions on Indian vessels.
The Directorate General of Shipping also issued a directive prohibiting maritime commerce between the two nations. The ban extends to all Pakistani goods, including those routed through third countries. Bilateral trade has been virtually frozen since 2019, when India imposed a 200 per cent tariff following the Pulwama attack.
Other measures announced in recent days include the suspension of postal exchanges, including parcels and letters sent via air or surface transport, and the closure of the Attari-Wagah land border crossing.

What Indian-Origin British Minister Said,"Sun, 04 May 2025 14:55:15 +0530","The United Kingdom is in talks with India to ensure shared access and benefit from historical artefacts like the Kohinoor diamond, said Lisa Nandy, Britain's Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport. The massive 105.6 carat stone--one of the largest cut diamonds in the world-- was held by rulers in India before landing in the hands of the East India Company from Maharaja Ranjit Singh's treasury and then being presented to Queen Victoria following the annexation of Punjab. It remains a symbol of British colonial loot and imperialism.
""We've been talking between the UK and India for quite some time about the way that we think we can collaborate much more closely together to make sure that people both in the UK and in India can benefit from and have access to many of the cultural artefacts that stem back to the very different era. This is something that I've discussed with my counterpart,"" Ms Nandy, who is in New Delhi on an official visit, told news agency ANI.

Stressing that the UK's relationship with India is ""very long"" and ""very deep"", she confirmed that her trip also marked the signing of a new cultural cooperation agreement between both nations.
""Across the creative industries, the UK and India really excel, whether it's film, fashion, TV, music, gaming. We're really good at these things, and we export many of those products to the world, but we know that through cooperation, we can do more and we can achieve more together. Our Science museums group has been working with the National Museum Science Museums group here to get joint collaborations, joint exhibitions, tour different objects, make sure that people in India and the UK can really benefit from that. We think that's the model for how we can cooperate much more closely across all the other creative industries as well,"" she said.
The British minister also met Foreign Minister S Jaishankar during her India visit. Talking about her meeting, she said, ""We were very pleased to have a bilateral meeting to discuss how we can cooperate much more closely.""
""Prime Minister Modi has signalled his personal commitment to taking what is already a huge Indian success story through film, fashion, and their wider creative industries and really putting rocket boosters under them for the coming years. Our Prime Minister, Sir Keir Starmer, very much agrees with him. That is exactly what the UK government is trying to do, and we have a lot of ambition for what India and the UK can achieve together,' she added.
She also condoled the terror attack in Jammu and Kashmir's Pahalgam and said the United Kingdom stands with the people of India against terrorism.
""Our Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, was very pleased to be able to send his condolences directly to Prime Minister Modi and to send our condolences to the families of the victims of these appalling attacks. The UK stands with India against terrorism, always in whatever form. We know the Indian nation is hurting because of those attacks, and our relationship with India is very long and very deep,"" Ms Nandy said

https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/temu-trump-atomic-power-promise-5-key-takeaways-from-australia-elections-8325610#pfrom=home-ndtvworld_world_top_scroll,"'Temu Trump', Atomic Power Promise: 5 Key Takeaways From Australia Elections","Sun, 04 May 2025 10:36:21 +0530","Australia's left-leaning Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has won re-election in a landslide, defying the so-called ""incumbency curse"" that has haunted governing parties around the globe.
His Labor Party dealt a crushing defeat to its conservative opposition, which was thrown into further disarray when leader Peter Dutton lost a seat he has held for 24 years.
Here are five takeaways from Saturday's vote.
US President Donald Trump's trade tariffs, and the chaos they unleashed, may not have been the biggest factor in the Labor Party victory -- but they helped.
Dutton vowed to slash the civil service, clamp down on immigration, and said he would not stand before an Aboriginal flag.
The harshest critics likened Dutton's offering to that of a ""Temu Trump"", an unflattering reference to the popular website offering cut-price unbranded goods.
""If we want to understand why a good chunk of the electorate has changed across the election campaign over the last couple of months, I think that's the biggest thing,"" said Henry Maher, a politics lecturer at the University of Sydney.
From South Africa to the United States, voters have in recent times turfed out a string of established governments in a global backlash dubbed the ""incumbency curse"".
With inflation biting, and populist parties seemingly on the rise elsewhere, many wondered whether Albanese's government would meet a similar fate.
Instead, Australians rewarded his steady-as-she-goes leadership style, choosing political stability in a time of global upheaval.
Dutton's US$200 billion promise to introduce atomic power to Australia for the first time has imploded.
The opposition leader was hounded on the campaign trail for not visiting any of the seven sites where he proposed to build industrial-scale nuclear reactors.
His nuclear dream included ramping up gas production, slowing the rollout of solar and wind projects, and ditching the clean energy goals set by Albanese's centre-left government.
""This was an energy referendum. Nuclear bombed at the ballot with Australians dubbing it toxic,"" said Amanda McKenzie, chief executive of clean energy advocate the Climate Council.
Dutton's Liberal-National coalition crashed to one of its worst-ever defeats, losing a string of seats once considered conservative strongholds.
With Dutton turfed from his own seat of Dickson -- an electorate he has held for 24 years -- the coalition will lick its wounds with no leader in place.
Notably, Dutton's opposition failed to win back a string of seats claimed by the so-called ""teal"" movement in 2022.
The teals -- a loose-knit group of political novices pushing for climate action -- held on to their inner-city seats despite a targeted conservative campaign.
Most opinion polls picked the winner -- but few hinted at the scale of the Labor landslide.
""This was beyond even our most optimistic expectations. It was a history-making night. It was one for the ages,"" Treasurer Jim Chalmers said Sunday.
Most polls pointed towards a Labor government -- but were split on whether Albanese would command a slim majority, or cobble together a coalition.
Instead, Labor is on course to win at least 82 seats in the 150-member parliament, partial results showed, easily ahead of the 76 needed for majority rule.

https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/lawrence-wongs-party-secures-landslide-victory-in-singapore-general-election-8323453#pfrom=home-ndtvworld_world_top_scroll,Lawrence Wong's Party Secures Landslide Victory In Singapore General Election,"Sun, 04 May 2025 00:57:33 +0530","Lawrence Wong, 52, was sworn-in last May as the new prime minister in 20 years.
Prime Minister Lawrence Wong's People's Action Party (PAP) won the Singapore General Election Saturday by a landslide, securing 87 of the 97 parliamentary seats, local media reported.
Mr Wong and the PAP had sought a new mandate from the general election in the midst of uncertainties to the global economy caused by the US trade tariffs.
The PAP, Singapore's oldest and largest political party, has ruled the city-state ever since independence in 1965.
About 2.6 million Singaporeans were eligible to vote on Saturday for 92 contested seats as the PAP's Group Representation Constituency for Marine Parade-Braddell Heights had a walkover on nomination day on April 23.
This was Mr Wong's first election as prime minister of the global-business focused Singapore which now faces navigating through strong headwinds caused by tariffs imposed by US President Donald Trump.
Speaking after the result for Marsiling-Yew Tee Group Representation Constituency (GRC) was announced, Wong said the election was his first and a “humbling experience”. He pledged to work hard for the voters.
“We are grateful for your strong mandate and… will honour the trust that you have given to us by working even harder for all of you,” said the 52-year-old premier.
The Elections Department (ELD) said Singaporeans cast their votes for 92 out of 97 parliamentary seats at 1,240 polling stations island-wide to decide the future politics of Singapore.
This was Singapore's 19th election since the first general election in 1948 and 14th since its Independence in 1965.
Mr Wong, 52, was sworn-in last May as the new prime minister in 20 years after Lee Hsien Loong stepped down after almost two decades.
There was vociferous campaigning by opposition political parties, raising issues related to high cost of living and housing as well as increasing presence of foreigners in almost all sectors of the economy in the manpower-short Singapore.
Top PAP leaders were seen balancing their election schedules during the last nine days of campaigning since nominations closed on April 23 along with negotiating tariffs imposed by Singapore's largest trading partner US.
Singapore's Deputy Prime Minister and Trade and Industry Minister Gan Kim Yong had been negotiating with his US counterparts on a 10 per cent tariff imposed on imports from Singapore.
The PAP fielded candidates in all 92 constituencies, while its main rival, the Workers' Party (WP), contested 26 seats in eight constituencies.
The Progress Singapore Party (PSP) fielded 13 candidates across six constituencies. Other parties in the fray included the Singapore People's Party (SPP), Singapore Democratic Party (SDP), People's Power Party (PPP), People's Alliance for Reform (PAR), Red Dot United (RDU), National Solidarity Party (NSP), Singapore United Party (SUP), and Singapore Democratic Alliance (SDA).
Prime Minister Wong had urged Singaporeans to vote responsibly as the global economies are going through unprecedented challenges and led to uncertainties.
The finance-trade-export focused city state sits in the middle of US-China trade war, having historical bilateral economic and diplomatic relations with both the giant markets, diplomatic sources said.
Manufacturing activity in Singapore fell into recession territory in April 2025 as tariffs announced by US President Donald Trump triggered a wave of export-order deferments and cancellations.
The purchasing managers' index (PMI), a barometer of the manufacturing sector's health, fell to 49.6 points in April, down one point from 50.6 in March; readings above 50 indicate growth while those below point to contraction.
“The contraction in Singapore's factory activity snaps 19 straight months of expansion,” reported The Straits Times, citing a Singapore Institute of Purchasing and Materials Management (SIPMM) report on Friday.
Meanwhile, the PAP had a walkover in one constituency of five members of parliament at the close of nomination day on April 23.
The PAP's share of the popular vote slipped to a near-record low of 61 per cent in 2020 elections, down from nearly 70 per cent in 2015 and although it kept 83 out of 93 parliamentary seats, the opposition gained ground with a record 10 seats. PTI GS OZ SCY NPK GSP GSP

The video, titled ""Lo-fi MAGA Video to Relax/Study To,"" was streamed live across the Trump administration's official YouTube and X channels.
Lo-Fi MAGA Video to Relax/Study To ????????Have a great weekend!https://t.co/IrKPU2i4i7
The video features calming, low-fidelity beats commonly used for background study or work music. Accompanying the audio was an animation of Trump at the Resolute Desk signing documents, alongside a continuous scroll of text highlighting key campaign promises and actions labelled ""Promises made, promises kept.""
The text scroll listed several of the administration's recent actions, including executive orders aimed at eliminating diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programs in the military and policies targeting birthright citizenship for children of undocumented immigrants.
According to a White House official the 15-minute clip will loop throughout the weekend across digital platforms to explore ""innovative ways to distribute fact sheets and other information.""
The video wraps up a week-long campaign by the White House to spotlight what it says are Trump's key achievements in the first 100 days of his second term. Among the highlights were a newly launched ""White House Wire"" section on the official website modelled after the conservative Drudge Report, a round of ""new media"" briefings led by press secretary Karoline Leavitt, and over 100 interviews granted to conservative influencers and podcasters.
This media push came during a rough week for the administration, marked by the ouster of National Security Adviser Mike Waltz following the ""Signalgate"" scandal, as perUS media.
The controversy erupted when Waltz took full responsibility for inadvertently adding journalist Jeffrey Goldberg to aSignal group chatdiscussing classified military operations in Yemen.
In his first 100 days of his second term, Donald Trump took swift and controversial actions.
He declared a national emergency at the southern border, deployed troops, ended birthright citizenship for undocumented immigrants, and signed the Laken Riley Act to crack down on undocumented crime.
He issued executive orders to dismantle DEI programmes, withdraw from the World Health Organization, and declassify JFK assassination files. Trump also reintroduced tariffs on China, Canada, and Mexico, leading to trade tensions, and cut funding to the US cybersecurity agency (CISA).
He pardoned over 1,500 people tied to the January 6 Capitol attack and Ross Ulbricht, the Silk Road founder. He appointed Elon Musk to lead a new Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) and rolled back federal regulations.

However, the situation quickly turned deadly.
A fully-grown female crocodile, named Lalay, charged towards the man, sinking her fangs deep into his arm. Horrified onlookers screamed as the crocodile clamped her jaws around his arm, and then grabbed his thigh, attempting a deadly death roll to tear him apart.
The gruesome attack lasted for 30 minutes, with the tourist trapped in the enclosure. Lalay's handler eventually intervened, using a piece of cement to bash the crocodile on the head, causing her to loosen her grip and freeing the victim. Medics quickly wrapped the visitor's arm and thigh with cloth to control the bleeding before rushing him to the hospital for further treatment. He received more than 50 stitches.
Police officers told local media that the man had climbed into the enclosure because he thought the crocodile was fake.
""The tourist was walking around the area, then he saw the crocodile, which he thought was just a plastic fixture. He climbed the fence and entered the enclosure, and the crocodile attacked him. This kind of behaviour is very dangerous. Nobody should ever enter an animal's enclosure at the zoo. He put other people's lives at risk, and he is very lucky to have survived,"" Police Staff Sergeant Joel Sajolga of the Siay Municipal Police told multiple outlets, per TheDaily Mail.
An investigation into the incident is still ongoing.

The devastated mother, Jeanette Dees, and the relatives of convicted murderer Te'Bryis Robinson, 19, got into an altercation inside the Sedgwick County Courthouse on April 8, KWCH reported.
The altercation started after Ms Dee urged the judge to impose the ""maximum possible sentence"" on her son's killer during her court appearance.
She also insulted Robison and his friends and family present in the courtroom.
The mother's remarks before the sentencing created an uproar in the courtroom, resulting in insults exchanged before the first blow was delivered.
A member of Ms Dees' family was seen getting up from his seat and punching one of Robinson's relatives in the face.
This led to a brawl between the two families in the centre of the courtroom.
The District Attorney's office charged Ms Dees with one count of disorderly conduct and a $500 fine, the Sedgwick County Sheriff's Office confirmed.
Others who have been charged with disorderly conduct were Trerntasia Hutton, Derrick Parker, Trentavies Hutton, Trentez Hutton, and a 16-year-old boy.
Before the sentence was delivered, several people were expelled from the courtroom. The judge sentenced Robinson to 21 years and three months in jail for the murder of TrenJ'vious ""Tubby"" Hutton.
In another incident from February, the uncle and stepfather of the accused assaulted a New Mexico murder suspect, Alexander Ortiz, 21, in court.
Ortiz was arrested by Albuquerque police for shooting Alianna Farfan, his ex-girlfriend.
Courtroom video footage showed a man jumping over the barricade separating the public in the courtroom and charging at Ortiz as he tried to escape. Another man followed a few moments later.
A frenzied altercation broke out, with Carlos Lucero, Pete Ysasi, Ortiz, Ortiz's father, a correctional officer, and an anonymous sixth man all grappling on the ground.
Lucero and Ysasi were seen punching a man wearing pants and a dark long-sleeved shirt while the prison guard tried to protect Ortiz.

For the past seven years, Abel has been overseeing Berkshire's BNSF railroad and its treat makers, See's Candies and Dairy Queen, along with dozens of other manufacturing and retail businesses that Buffett acquired over the years.
He grew up in Canada as a hockey player and learned the value of hard work as he redeemed discarded bottles and worked for a small company filling fire extinguishers. Now he finds himself at the top of the food chain in the investment world.
Read:Warren Buffett To Step Down, Greg Abel To Be New Berkshire Hathaway CEO
Berkshire confirmed Abel as Buffett's successor in 2021 after former Vice Chairman Charlie Munger let it slip at the annual meeting. Since then, Abel has largely remained in Buffett's shadow, although shareholders have had a chance to get to know him a bit when he appeared alongside Buffett at the annual meetings and in interviews.
Berkshire's board will now vote on whether to formally approve Abel as the new CEO to take over at the end of 2025. At the annual meeting in Omaha, Buffett said he expects that to occur by a unanimous vote.
Abel will step forward to take responsibility for all of Berkshire's eclectic assortment of businesses with their nearly 400,000 employees and the conglomerate's massive stock portfolio. Buffett and members of Berkshire's board, who for years have devoted much of their time to finding Buffett's successor, have praised Abel's brilliance and knack for understanding all kinds of businesses.
Buffett once said Berkshire is ""so damn lucky"" to have Abel ready to take over, but he will have trouble coming close to Buffett's remarkable track record of outpacing the market. Whereas Buffett grew Berkshire over the decades by making well-timed deals and stock investments at attractive prices, Berkshire's massive size has made it that much harder lately to find anything big enough to change the conglomerate's bottom line.
Read:Warren Buffett's Best And Worst Investments In Last 60 Years
Abel has big shoes to fill, but no one expects him to match the accomplishments of Buffett, who made him a billionaire many times over and one of the wealthiest investors of the past century. Longtime Berkshire board member Ron Olson said two days before the announcement that he believed Abel was ready to take over.
""Is he another Warren Buffett? No, there is no other Warren Buffett that I know. But he has so many of the fundamentals of Warren,"" Olson said. ""He is for sure high integrity. He is a hard worker. He is a strategic thinker.""
Buffett has said for years that Abel's main job when he becomes CEO will be to preserve Berkshire's unique decentralised culture built on independence, integrity, and trust. In fact, Munger's comment that gave away Abel's future role was that ""Greg will keep the culture.""
Executives at a diverse mix of Berkshire subsidiaries, including sneaker maker Brooks Running, flooring giant Shaw and Borsheims jewelry, have said they all turn to Abel whenever they face tough questions in their businesses related to strategy or operating details, and he's always available when they need him, though he will challenge them.
Read:""Won't Bet On A Currency Going To Hell"": Warren Buffett's Dollar Warning
""When I think about Greg, he not only has high business acumen, but he has really high business instincts,"" Dairy Queen CEO Troy Bader said Friday. ""The intuition is really important. And, you know, Warren has that intuition, but Greg has a lot of it as well.""
Abel has never done many interviews, though he put his detailed business knowledge on display at the Berkshire meetings when discussing utilities and the railroad. But he did offer a glimpse into his background to the Horatio Alger Association when that group honoured him in 2018.
Abel's family-oriented upbringing in Edmonton, Alberta, and lessons in hard work and perseverance were similar to what Buffett learned while working in his grandfather's Omaha grocery store as a kid.
""I think hard work leads to good outcomes. In my schooling, in sports, and in my business positions, I learned that if I put in a lot of work and was well-prepared, then success would be more likely,"" Abel said in 2018.
Abel lives about two hours from Buffett's hometown in Des Moines, Iowa, where he has led Berkshire Hathaway Energy since 2011 and helped coach his kids' hockey and soccer teams. He is expected to continue living there because Berkshire is so decentralised that there is little reason to move to its Omaha headquarters. Buffett only had a couple of dozen people working in his office as he spent his days reading business reports and making the occasional phone call.

The ballistic missile fired by the Iran-backed Houthis in Yemen hit near Israel's Ben Gurion Airport after ""several attempts"" to intercept it failed, the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) said on Sunday. Israel has, meanwhile, pledged to hit back 'seven times stronger' after Yemen missile fire.
The missile struck a grove adjacent to an access road, inside the country's main airport's perimeter, according to a report by the Times of Israel.
The military said it made several attempts to intercept the missile fired from Yemen, but ""an impact was identified in the area of Ben Gurion Airport.""
The Israeli Air Force's aerial defence array is probing the failure. ""An investigation is underway regarding the impact at the Ben Gurion Airport area,"" the Israel Airport Authority says in a statement.
At least six people were reportedly injured after the missile fell on one of the airport's parking lots. Surveillance camera footage emerged on social media showing the moment the Houthi missile struck near the airport.

There was no report of any major damage in the attack, but the airspace was closed for around an hour. However, the airport reopened its airspace and resumed takeoffs and landings shortly after.
Meanwhile, National Unity chairman and former Israeli Minister Benny Gantz, who quit the government last year in June in protest against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's policy on the war in Gaza, called on the government to hold Iran accountable for the strike.
""This is not Yemen, this is Iran. It is Iran that is firing ballistic missiles at the State of Israel, and it must bear responsibility,"" wrote the former defence minister on X.
""The Israeli government must wake up,"" he insisted, arguing that fire on Israel ""must lead to a severe response in Tehran.""

The protest was called by Hefazat-e-Islam-- an influential Bangladeshi Islamist group-- claiming that some of the proposed recommendations hurt ""the sentiments of the majority of the people of this country"".
Leaders of the Hefazat-e-Islam group claimed that draft recommendations of the Women's Affairs Reform Commission instituted by the Muhammad Yunus' interim government are contradictory to Sharia law. The group threatened a nationwide protest on May 23 if the government didn't meet their demands.
Over 20,000 followers of the group rallied near the Dhaka University, some carrying banners and placards reading ""Say no to Western laws on our women, rise up Bangladesh"", in one of their biggest public shows of strength in years as religious activism surged in Bangladesh following the ouster of deposed prime minister Sheikh Hasina's Awami League regime last year. Protestors mostly included teachers and students of non-government or ""kawmi"" madrassas.
Islamist groups in Bangladesh have increased their visibility since former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's ouster, and minority groups have complained of being intimidated.
The protestors mainly denounced proposed recommendations for ensuring equal rights, including ones related to property, for mainly Muslim women. Nayeb-e-Ameer or senior leader of the platform, Maulana Mahfuzul Huq, announced a 12-point charter of demands, with the first one being the abolition of the existing women reform commission and its members punished for the proposed changes, and constituting a new one comprising Islamic scholars and women representatives.
He said the commission's proposed changes hurt ""the sentiments of the majority of the people of this country"" by labelling the religious laws of inheritance as the main cause of inequality between men and women.
The group's leaders also demanded that the interim government led by Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad punus ban the Awami League party led by former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who was ousted in August. Hasina's opponents accuse her government of killing hundreds of students and others during the uprising that ended her 15-year rule. Hasina has been in exile in India since her ouster.
""Men and women can never be equal,"" a women's madrassa teacher, Mohammad Shihab Uddin, told the rally, adding that the Quran outlined specific codes of life for both genders and ""there is no way we can go beyond that"".
The Hefazat called for reinstating ""complete faith and trust in almighty Allah"" in the constitution and asked the government to abandon the ""suicidal concept"" of pluralism and to protect what they said were the Muslims' faith and practices. The group also opposed the inclusion of terms such as ""gender identity,"" ""gender diversity,"" ""gender equality,"" ""gender discrimination,"" ""third gender,"" and ""other genders"".
It argued that these are used to promote LGBT and transgender inclusion under ambiguous slogans such as ""Leave no one behind"" and ""inclusive"" and feared that these ideas could lead to a ""destructive, anti-religious pro-homosexual society"".
The Women's Affairs Reform Commission is one of the several commissions instituted by the interim government to carry out reform. It had recently submitted its recommendations to the government.

US President Donald Trump has signalled he is open to lowering massive tariffs imposed on China, as he acknowledged that the current levies are so high that the two of the world's largest economies have essentially stopped doing business with each other. As part of his 'America First' policy, Trump has imposed a universal 10 per cent tariff on most goods coming into the United States, but duties on Chinese imports were placed as high as 145 per cent. In retaliation, China hiked tariffs by 125 per cent on American imports.
The escalating trade standoff between Beijing and Washington has rattled financial markets and risks driving up costs for manufacturing equipment as well as those of affordable goods like clothing and toys that many Americans rely on.
""At some point, I'm going to lower them, because otherwise, you could never do business with them, and they want to do business very much,"" Trump said in an interview on NBC's 'Meet the Press with Kristen Welker'.
The US President pointed to recent economic struggles in China, where factory activity has declined into the worst contraction since 2023, according to the official manufacturing purchasing managers' index. Furthermore, new export orders have dropped to their lowest point since December 2022, marking the sharpest decline since April of that year, when Shanghai was placed under a full pandemic lockdown, according to a report by Bloomberg.
Trump stated that there have been ""positive"" statements from Beijing recently, while reiterating that any deal finalised with China has to be ""fair.""
Meanwhile, Beijing on Friday showed first signs of being open to sit across the US on the negotiation table since Trump's tariffs were announced last month, and said it was evaluating the possibility of trade talks with Washington.
""China is currently evaluating this,"" the ministry's statement said.
Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One on Sunday, Trump said he has no plans to speak with Chinese President Xi Jinping this week, saying the two sides are ""talking about different things.""
He added that the US is in trade discussions with several countries, including China, and emphasised he's looking for a ""fair deal,"" repeating his claim that ""China has been ripping us off for many years.""

However, now thousands of green card holders in the US, including Indians, are living in fear of deportation amid President Donald Trump's crackdown on immigration. In a new warning to green card holders, the Trump administration has asked them to behave like a ""guest"" in the US or risk being deported from the country.
Asking green card holders to abide by American ""laws and values"", the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) listed reasons why the government can take away the ""privilege"" of permanent residency from immigrants.
""Green cards and visas will be revoked if an alien breaks the law,"" USCIS said in a post on X.

""Coming to America and receiving a visa or green card is a privilege. Our laws and values must be respected. If you advocate for violence, endorse or support terrorist activity, or encourage others to do so, you are no longer eligible to stay in the US,"" the Immigration Department added further.
The department added that it is continuously working alongside the Department of Homeland Security to rigorously vet all aliens even after a visa or green card has been obtained.

""This vigilance is essential to making America safe again. Break the laws and you will lose your green card or visa privilege,"" it added.
The move--which follows the launch of a new ""Catch-And-Revoke"" -- raised concerns among legal residents amid the mass deportations of illegal immigrants by the Trump Administration. Announcing the policy, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio has said, ""Whenever the government catches non-US citizens breaking our laws, we will take action to revoke their status. The era of abusing our nation's generosity is over.""
For Indian immigrants, the path to permanent residency or a green card is already particularly daunting. Due to per-country limits, Indian nationals can face wait times of 50 years or more for employment-based green cards. Now, the new rules suggest that even if people secured permanent residency after years of waiting, their future in the US is not secured, and they can be deported over a minor run-in with the law.
Under old norms, immigrants had the legal safeguard to challenge revocations or rectify minor violations, which the new policy could eliminate, potentially making visa revocation a ground for deportation without appeal.

The lawyer was allegedly hacked to death outside the court premises on November 7 last year.
Chittagong's Metropolitan Magistrate S M Alauddin granted the police application for Das' arrest and passed the order during a virtual hearing.
""Investigating officers submitted applications on Sunday to show Chinmoy Krishna Das was arrested in four cases. The court on Monday granted shown arrest in the Alif murder case following a virtual hearing. The hearings on the other three applications will be held on Tuesday,"" Dhaka Tribune quoted Public Prosecutor of the Chittagong Metropolitan Sessions Judge Court, Mofizul Haque Bhuiyan as saying.
Earlier on April 30, the Appellate Division of the Bangladesh Supreme Court stayed the High Court order of granting bail to Das in a sedition case.
Judge of the Appellate Division, Justice Rezaul Haque passed the order after hearing an appeal filed by the state counsel hours after the High Court granted him bail.
The stay order remains in force until the filing of a leave-to-appeal petition and release of the full text of the verdict.
The Bangladesh High Court had earlier granted bail to Das, who was arrested on November 25 last year on charges of sedition, linked to alleged disrespect of the national flag during a rally in Chittagong. His arrest had sparked widespread outrage across the world.
Chinmoy was arrested in Dhaka on November 25 and sent to jail the following day after a Chittagong court rejected his bail plea. On December 11, 2024, the same court again refused bail in the case.
The arrest of Das had sparked massive protests by the Hindu community in Bangladesh, which has been in political turmoil since August 2024 when former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina was removed amidst widespread violent demonstrations.
In the following nine months, Bangladesh has witnessed rising cases of attacks on the Hindu community ever since the Hasina-led government was toppled and an interim administration was formed under the leadership of Muhammad Yunus.
India has taken a tough line on the rights of the Hindu minority and repeatedly stated that there is ""systematic persecution of Hindu minorities"" under the Yunus-led interim government.
Last month, Prime Minister Narendra Modi raised the issue of the safety and security of minorities in Bangladesh, including Hindus, during his meeting with Yunus on the sidelines of the BIMSTEC Summit in Bangkok.
Recently, Bhabesh Chandra Roy, a prominent leader of the Hindu community associated with the Bangladesh Puja Udjapan Committee, was abducted from his home and beaten to death by four individuals on April 18.

""I Don't Know,"" Replies Trump","Mon, 05 May 2025 08:13:52 +0530","Trump expressed uncertainty about upholding the Constitution and dismissed questions on due process for migrants. He distanced himself from pursuing a third term while critiquing Biden's economy. Trump's remarks drew scrutiny from both parties
US President Donald Trump said in remarks airing Sunday that he does not know whether he must uphold the US Constitution, the nation's founding legal document.
In a wide-ranging NBC News interview, the 78-year-old Republican also said he was not seriously considering running for a constitutionally-barred third White House term, and blamed his presidential predecessor Joe Biden for the ""bad parts"" of the current economy.
Trump has drawn widespread criticism for repeatedly brushing up against constitutional guardrails since returning to the White House in January, notably over his policy of mass deportations of undocumented migrants, some without the benefit of a court hearing.
He insists such rapid expulsions are necessary in the face of what he has declared to be a ""national emergency,"" and that giving every migrant a court trial would take ""300 years.""
When NBC's ""Meet the Press"" moderator Kristen Welker asked if citizens and non-citizens alike deserve the due process of law, as the US Constitution states, Trump said: ""I'm not a lawyer. I don't know.""
Pressed on whether he believes he needs to uphold the supreme law of the land, Trump repeated: ""I don't know.""
The remarks quickly made waves in Washington, including among some Republicans.
""We're either a free society governed by the Constitution or we're not,"" Republican Senator Rand Paul, a self-described constitutional conservative, posted on X with no additional comment.
No Third Term?
Trump's suggestion of possibly seeking a third term in office has been sharply questioned by legal and constitutional scholars.
The 22nd Amendment states that ""no person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice.""
But Trump said in March he was ""not joking"" about seeking a third term, adding without elaboration that there are ""methods"" that would allow it to happen.
Changing the Constitution to allow a third term would be a heavy lift, requiring a two-thirds majority in both houses of Congress and ratification by at least 38 of the 50 US state legislatures.
But ""this is not something I'm looking to do,"" Trump told NBC's Welker.
""I'm looking to have four great years and turn it over to somebody, ideally a great Republican, a great Republican to carry it forward.""
Asked who that might be, he mentioned Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, adding: ""We have a lot of good people in this party.""
But Trump appeared to bristle when asked for his reaction to critics who warn he is taking the country down an authoritarian path.
""Why don't you ask it a different way? Many people want to come into our country. Many people love Trump,"" he said. ""I won the election.""
Trump's first 100 days in office were marked by economic turmoil, primarily over his plans to impose sweeping tariffs on most countries.
But despite the world's largest economy shrinking in the first quarter of 2025, he struck an optimistic if defiant tone in the interview, insisting US economics were sound and that ""tariffs are going to make us rich.""
""I think the good parts are the Trump economy and the bad parts are the Biden economy,"" said Trump.
The president also exaggerated some of the success he has had in bringing down prices, claiming gas in the United States has dropped to as low as $1.98 per gallon.
According to the American Automobile Association, the lowest US price per gallon this week was $2.65, with the average at $3.16.
The president, walking with Welker through his glitzy Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, addressed how he wants to build a multi-million-dollar ""ballroom"" in the White House financed by him.
He also ruminated on an upcoming military parade in Washington to coincide with his 79th birthday, on June 14.
""We're going to have a big, beautiful parade,"" he said, swatting away concern about the event's high cost as his administration lays off thousands of government workers.
""We have the greatest weapons in the world, and we're going to celebrate it.""

Bandna Bhatti, who is pursuing a degree in Data Science, slipped and fell from an outdoor staircase at the Phi Kappa Tau fraternity house at around 1 pm on April 19.
After the tragic fall, the woman did not receive proper medical treatment for roughly seven hours before her friends finally called 911, according to a report by FOX KTVU.
""She cannot walk. She cannot move her body,"" her mother, Sukh Bhatti, told KTVU.
According to the family, Bhatti was at a fraternity party on Cal Day at UC Berkeley-- an annual open house for incoming freshmen and their families-- when she fell around 12 feet, landing on a narrow passageway outside the frat house. She struck her head on the way down, where she was left unattended for 15 minutes before being discovered by her friends, her family told KTVU.
Her friends then took her inside the fraternity house, but instead of calling emergency services, people at the frat house allegedly asked them to leave the party with her.  Unaware of the extent of her injuries, Bhatti's friends took her back to her nearby apartment, the family claimed.
Her friends reportedly called 911 around seven hours later.
In addition to a spinal fracture that resulted in paralysis, Bhatti had sustained severe injuries, including tearing of the dura with spinal fluid leakage, a scapular fracture, and a brain hematoma, her sister Sonya Bhatti wrote in a GoFundMe page created to raise money for the college senior's medical care.
""She is currently hospitalised. These injuries are not only life-altering but will require extensive and ongoing medical care, including physical therapy, rehabilitation, and specialised support to help her navigate this new chapter,"" the page reads.
The page mentioned that Bhatti was just three weeks away from graduating from UC Berkeley with a degree in Data Science-""a milestone she had worked so hard for.""
UC Berkeley and the fraternity, meanwhile, said they are offering support to the student and her family.
""UC Berkeley is aware of an ongoing police investigation regarding reports of a student being injured near or at a fraternity. Our thoughts are with the student, their family, loved ones and friends during this time. We are following our protocols to offer support to the student and their family,"" the university said in a statement to PEOPLE.
""Our thoughts are with the individual and their loved ones during this challenging time. The health, safety and well-being of all individuals in our community remain our highest priority,"" Matt Arnold, the CEO of the national Phi Kappa Tau organisation, said in a statement to The New York Post.

This change impacts Pakistan’s earnings from overflight fees.
Amid increasing tension between New Delhi and Islamabad following a terror attack in Jammu and Kashmir's Pahalgam, several international airlines are avoiding Pakistani airspace, according to airlines' statements and flight tracker data. Among major airlines avoiding airspace over Pakistan are Air France, British Airways, UAE's Emirates and Germany's Lufthansa.
The airspace detours follow retaliatory measures between nuclear-armed rivals after a Pakistan-backed terrorist group took responsibility for the Pahalgam terror attack in which 26 people were killed, mostly civilians. In response to the attack, India has closed its airspace to Pakistani carriers. Pakistan has also barred Indian-owned or operated aircraft from its airspace.
Flight tracking data from Flightradar24 showed that Lufthansa Flight LH760 from Frankfurt to New Delhi flew nearly an hour longer on Sunday, as it took a longer route to its destination. The airline, in a statement to news agency Reuters, said Lufthansa Group is ""avoiding Pakistani airspace until further notice."" The carrier added that it is monitoring developments in the region and will update its route accordingly.
Flight tracking data showed some flights of British Airways, Swiss International Air Lines and Emirates were also turning north towards Delhi in order to avoid Pakistani airspace, after travelling over the Arabian Sea.
Citing the ""recent evolution of tensions"" between India and Pakistan, Air France, in a statement, said that it has ""decided to suspend overflight of Pakistan until further notice.""
The carrier said it was altering its flight schedule and plans with destinations such as Delhi, Bangkok and Ho Chi Minh, entailing longer flight times.
So far, British Airways, Swiss International Air Lines and Emirates have not issued any formal statements, but their rerouted flights reflect broader industry caution, despite longer distances and higher fuel costs for airlines.
The flight route alterations are set to cut Pakistan's earnings from overflight fees, which can run into hundreds of dollars a flight, depending on aircraft weight and distance covered.
Pakistan's reserves with the central bank stand at $10.2 billion, barely enough to cover two months' worth of imports, according to a Reuters report.

Aspergillus, a type of fungus that thrives in warm, damp climates, has the potential to infect millions if it makes its way into the aforementioned regions.
Norman van Rhijn, the study co-author, has warned that the world was approaching a ""tipping point"" where the spread of fungal pathogens could become the norm.
""We're talking about hundreds of thousands of lives, and continental shifts in species distributions. In 50 years, where things grow and what you get infected by is going to be completely different,"" Mr Van Rhijn told theFinancial Times.
As per the study, the species can grow quickly in high temperatures in compost, which explains why it is able to thrive in the 37C internal temperature of the human body. Additionally, fungi's resilience means they can survive and thrive in places that other organisms can't, even inside Chernobyl's nuclear reactors.
While inhaling the fungus's spores does not make everyone ill, those with conditions such as asthma, cystic fibrosis or a weakened immune system remain at risk.

What makes the situation worrisome is the fact that the fungal kingdom is largely unexplored by scientists. Less than 10 per cent of an estimated 1.5 to 3.8 million fungi species have been described, and only a tiny fraction have had their genetic material (genome) sequenced.
""Its lifestyle in the natural environment may have provided Aspergillus fumigatus with the fitness advantage needed to colonise human lungs,"" said Professor Elaine Bignell, co-director at the MRC Centre for Medical Mycology at Exeter University.
The study highlighted thatAspergillus fumigatuscould spread across an additional 77 per cent of territory by the year 2100 as a result of the world's heavy use of fossil fuels. As a result, potentially nine million people in Europe could be exposed to the infection.
While the danger is imminent, scientists say the development of antifungal medicines has been hobbled by the financial unattractiveness of investing in them, because of high costs and doubts over their profitability.

Ariana Rodriguez's discoveries include Hermes boxes, Prada shoes, a vintage Burberry coat, and even a Sohmer & Co piano, with values ranging from hundreds to thousands of dollars.
A 35-year-old mother-of-three, Ms Rodriguez started thrifting three years ago when she joined her local 'buy nothing' Facebook group. There, she discovered the world of ""stooping"" - sourcing items left out on the street. She was drawn to the idea of finding free goods, particularly for her children, aged six, three, and two.
Six months ago, Ms Rodriguez started digging through dumpsters and trash bags. She estimates that her finds could be worth anywhere from $10,000 (over Rs 8.4 lakh) to $30,000 (over Rs 25.3 lakh). While she keeps some items, including arts and crafts, for her children, others are given away or sold. Anything non-perishable, including clothes and blankets, goes to her local church to help those in need,The NY Postreported.
In her quest for treasure, Ms Rodriguez heads out with full glam. She dresses up in her best outfits for her treasure hunts, hoping to challenge the stigma surrounding dumpster diving. ""Anyone can do it,"" she tells the NY Post. ""I hope the stigmas are removed, there's nothing wrong with it.""
Some of her recent findings include a Stokke high chair worth $397 (around Rs 33,000), a bag of games valued at $200 (almost Rs 17,000), and a glass vanity worth $2,500 (almost Rs 2.1 lakh). Ms Rodriguez often resells furniture, or in the case of small trinkets, puts them up for sale.
She said her efforts also contribute to reducing waste. ""The biggest part of it is my profound desire to keep things out of the landfill,"" she shared.
Ms Rodrguez also frequently visits apartment cleanouts where people toss out unwanted furniture. She has uncovered everything from mirrors and nightstands to real gold jewellery and even money. Her most significant find was a Bally briefcase, which she believes dates back to the 1960s.
""I've found incredible pieces,"" she said, ""People get sick of furniture and just dump it.""
She faces criticism from people who say her trash diving is unsanitary, but she remains unbothered. ""It's more embarrassing to be over-consuming and throwing everything out,"" she said. Her husband, a day trader, has even joined her in the adventure, showing that this is a family affair.
Ms Rodriguez's most recent treasure includes a table worth $750 to $3,500 (Rs 62,500 to Rs 2,91,500), Jibbitz charms valued at $50 (Rs 4,100), a basketball hoop worth $35 (Rs 2,900), a bag of Hermes boxes valued at $175 (Rs 14,500), a glass lamp worth $150 (Rs 12,500), a bag of games valued at $200 (Rs 16,700), a glass vanity worth $2,500 (Rs 2,08,000), and a bedside table valued at $949 (Rs 78,800).
She believes dumpster diving is like digging for gold. ""You never know what you're going to find,"" she said. ""When you're out doing a trash dig, you'll see someone's whole life. There is a whole historical component.""

It is currently a tourist site.
Once one of the US' toughest prisons, the Alcatraz facility will now house the country's most ruthless and violent offenders.On Truth Social, the US President wrote, ""Today I am directing the Bureau of Prisons, together with the Department of Justice, FBI, and Homeland Security, to reopen a substantially enlarged and rebuilt ALCATRAZ.""
All About Alcatraz Prison
Alcatraz Prison, once a maximum security federal prison, is located off the coast of San Francisco, California. Once a fort, it was turned into a US Army military prison in 1912. It was then used as a facility for the Federal Bureau of Prisons in 1934 after the buildings were modernised and security increased.
The three-storey cellhouse was believed to be the most secure prison in the US. Its isolation, the frigid waters, strong ocean currents, and the presence of sharks made it impossible for anyone to escape it.
The main prison building had three floors and included four cell blocks, the warden's office, a visiting room, a library, and a barber shop. The most dangerous prisoners were sent to D-Block, and six cells at the end were called The Hole.
The prison corridors were named after famous US streets such as Broadway and Michigan Avenue. When the buildings were modernised in 1934, they reused the construction materials such as iron staircases, cell house doors near the barber shop, and granite blocks - originally used to hold guns - to build the wharf's walls.
They also used old prison bars to strengthen the walls before being replaced after the salt air and water caused erosion.
The Alcatraz prison was the last resort for criminals considered the most dangerous. Among the famous ones housed here were Alphonse ""AI"" Capone, also known as Scarface; George ""Machine Gun"" Kelly, who was involved in bootlegging and kidnapping during the Prohibition era; and Robert Franklin Stroud, also known as the ""Birdman of Alcatraz,"" who was convicted of manslaughter in 1909. He later murdered a prison guard.
Other criminals included Alvin ""Creepy"" Karpis, Arthur ""Doc"" Barker, Henri Young, and Bumpy Johnson.
The Alcatraz prison was closed in 1963 due to its high maintenance costs and deteriorating conditions. In 1972, the US government handed over the island to the National Park Service (NPS), which then became a part of the Golden Gate National Recreation Area.
The prison buildings were preserved and turned into a museum. Visitors could tour the prison cells and see the famous escape routes. They were also entertained with audio guides and information displays.

US President Donald Trump has signalled he is open to lowering massive tariffs imposed on China, as he acknowledged that the current levies are so high that the two of the world's largest economies have essentially stopped doing business with each other. As part of his 'America First' policy, Trump has imposed a universal 10 per cent tariff on most goods coming into the United States, but duties on Chinese imports were placed as high as 145 per cent. In retaliation, China hiked tariffs by 125 per cent on American imports.
The escalating trade standoff between Beijing and Washington has rattled financial markets and risks driving up costs for manufacturing equipment as well as those of affordable goods like clothing and toys that many Americans rely on.
""At some point, I'm going to lower them, because otherwise, you could never do business with them, and they want to do business very much,"" Trump said in an interview on NBC's 'Meet the Press with Kristen Welker'.
The US President pointed to recent economic struggles in China, where factory activity has declined into the worst contraction since 2023, according to the official manufacturing purchasing managers' index. Furthermore, new export orders have dropped to their lowest point since December 2022, marking the sharpest decline since April of that year, when Shanghai was placed under a full pandemic lockdown, according to a report by Bloomberg.
Trump stated that there have been ""positive"" statements from Beijing recently, while reiterating that any deal finalised with China has to be ""fair.""

""Coming to America and receiving a visa or green card is a privilege. Our laws and values must be respected. If you advocate for violence, endorse or support terrorist activity, or encourage others to do so, you are no longer eligible to stay in the US,"" the Immigration Department added further.
The department added that it is continuously working alongside the Department of Homeland Security to rigorously vet all aliens even after a visa or green card has been obtained.

""This vigilance is essential to making America safe again. Break the laws and you will lose your green card or visa privilege,"" it added.
The move--which follows the launch of a new ""Catch-And-Revoke"" -- raised concerns among legal residents amid the mass deportations of illegal immigrants by the Trump Administration. Announcing the policy, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio has said, ""Whenever the government catches non-US citizens breaking our laws, we will take action to revoke their status. The era of abusing our nation's generosity is over.""
For Indian immigrants, the path to permanent residency or a green card is already particularly daunting. Due to per-country limits, Indian nationals can face wait times of 50 years or more for employment-based green cards. Now, the new rules suggest that even if people secured permanent residency after years of waiting, their future in the US is not secured, and they can be deported over a minor run-in with the law.
Under old norms, immigrants had the legal safeguard to challenge revocations or rectify minor violations, which the new policy could eliminate, potentially making visa revocation a ground for deportation without appeal.

The lawyer was allegedly hacked to death outside the court premises on November 7 last year.
Chittagong's Metropolitan Magistrate S M Alauddin granted the police application for Das' arrest and passed the order during a virtual hearing.
""Investigating officers submitted applications on Sunday to show Chinmoy Krishna Das was arrested in four cases. The court on Monday granted shown arrest in the Alif murder case following a virtual hearing. The hearings on the other three applications will be held on Tuesday,"" Dhaka Tribune quoted Public Prosecutor of the Chittagong Metropolitan Sessions Judge Court, Mofizul Haque Bhuiyan as saying.
Earlier on April 30, the Appellate Division of the Bangladesh Supreme Court stayed the High Court order of granting bail to Das in a sedition case.
Judge of the Appellate Division, Justice Rezaul Haque passed the order after hearing an appeal filed by the state counsel hours after the High Court granted him bail.
The stay order remains in force until the filing of a leave-to-appeal petition and release of the full text of the verdict.
The Bangladesh High Court had earlier granted bail to Das, who was arrested on November 25 last year on charges of sedition, linked to alleged disrespect of the national flag during a rally in Chittagong. His arrest had sparked widespread outrage across the world.
Chinmoy was arrested in Dhaka on November 25 and sent to jail the following day after a Chittagong court rejected his bail plea. On December 11, 2024, the same court again refused bail in the case.
The arrest of Das had sparked massive protests by the Hindu community in Bangladesh, which has been in political turmoil since August 2024 when former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina was removed amidst widespread violent demonstrations.
In the following nine months, Bangladesh has witnessed rising cases of attacks on the Hindu community ever since the Hasina-led government was toppled and an interim administration was formed under the leadership of Muhammad Yunus.
India has taken a tough line on the rights of the Hindu minority and repeatedly stated that there is ""systematic persecution of Hindu minorities"" under the Yunus-led interim government.
Last month, Prime Minister Narendra Modi raised the issue of the safety and security of minorities in Bangladesh, including Hindus, during his meeting with Yunus on the sidelines of the BIMSTEC Summit in Bangkok.
Recently, Bhabesh Chandra Roy, a prominent leader of the Hindu community associated with the Bangladesh Puja Udjapan Committee, was abducted from his home and beaten to death by four individuals on April 18.

""I Don't Know,"" Replies Trump","Mon, 05 May 2025 08:13:52 +0530","Trump expressed uncertainty about upholding the Constitution and dismissed questions on due process for migrants. He distanced himself from pursuing a third term while critiquing Biden's economy. Trump's remarks drew scrutiny from both parties
US President Donald Trump said in remarks airing Sunday that he does not know whether he must uphold the US Constitution, the nation's founding legal document.
In a wide-ranging NBC News interview, the 78-year-old Republican also said he was not seriously considering running for a constitutionally-barred third White House term, and blamed his presidential predecessor Joe Biden for the ""bad parts"" of the current economy.
Trump has drawn widespread criticism for repeatedly brushing up against constitutional guardrails since returning to the White House in January, notably over his policy of mass deportations of undocumented migrants, some without the benefit of a court hearing.
He insists such rapid expulsions are necessary in the face of what he has declared to be a ""national emergency,"" and that giving every migrant a court trial would take ""300 years.""
When NBC's ""Meet the Press"" moderator Kristen Welker asked if citizens and non-citizens alike deserve the due process of law, as the US Constitution states, Trump said: ""I'm not a lawyer. I don't know.""
Pressed on whether he believes he needs to uphold the supreme law of the land, Trump repeated: ""I don't know.""
The remarks quickly made waves in Washington, including among some Republicans.
""We're either a free society governed by the Constitution or we're not,"" Republican Senator Rand Paul, a self-described constitutional conservative, posted on X with no additional comment.
No Third Term?
Trump's suggestion of possibly seeking a third term in office has been sharply questioned by legal and constitutional scholars.
The 22nd Amendment states that ""no person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice.""
But Trump said in March he was ""not joking"" about seeking a third term, adding without elaboration that there are ""methods"" that would allow it to happen.
Changing the Constitution to allow a third term would be a heavy lift, requiring a two-thirds majority in both houses of Congress and ratification by at least 38 of the 50 US state legislatures.
But ""this is not something I'm looking to do,"" Trump told NBC's Welker.
""I'm looking to have four great years and turn it over to somebody, ideally a great Republican, a great Republican to carry it forward.""
Asked who that might be, he mentioned Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, adding: ""We have a lot of good people in this party.""
But Trump appeared to bristle when asked for his reaction to critics who warn he is taking the country down an authoritarian path.
""Why don't you ask it a different way? Many people want to come into our country. Many people love Trump,"" he said. ""I won the election.""
Trump's first 100 days in office were marked by economic turmoil, primarily over his plans to impose sweeping tariffs on most countries.
But despite the world's largest economy shrinking in the first quarter of 2025, he struck an optimistic if defiant tone in the interview, insisting US economics were sound and that ""tariffs are going to make us rich.""
""I think the good parts are the Trump economy and the bad parts are the Biden economy,"" said Trump.
The president also exaggerated some of the success he has had in bringing down prices, claiming gas in the United States has dropped to as low as $1.98 per gallon.
According to the American Automobile Association, the lowest US price per gallon this week was $2.65, with the average at $3.16.
The president, walking with Welker through his glitzy Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, addressed how he wants to build a multi-million-dollar ""ballroom"" in the White House financed by him.
He also ruminated on an upcoming military parade in Washington to coincide with his 79th birthday, on June 14.
""We're going to have a big, beautiful parade,"" he said, swatting away concern about the event's high cost as his administration lays off thousands of government workers.
""We have the greatest weapons in the world, and we're going to celebrate it.""

Bandna Bhatti, who is pursuing a degree in Data Science, slipped and fell from an outdoor staircase at the Phi Kappa Tau fraternity house at around 1 pm on April 19.
After the tragic fall, the woman did not receive proper medical treatment for roughly seven hours before her friends finally called 911, according to a report by FOX KTVU.
""She cannot walk. She cannot move her body,"" her mother, Sukh Bhatti, told KTVU.
According to the family, Bhatti was at a fraternity party on Cal Day at UC Berkeley-- an annual open house for incoming freshmen and their families-- when she fell around 12 feet, landing on a narrow passageway outside the frat house. She struck her head on the way down, where she was left unattended for 15 minutes before being discovered by her friends, her family told KTVU.
Her friends then took her inside the fraternity house, but instead of calling emergency services, people at the frat house allegedly asked them to leave the party with her.  Unaware of the extent of her injuries, Bhatti's friends took her back to her nearby apartment, the family claimed.
Her friends reportedly called 911 around seven hours later.
In addition to a spinal fracture that resulted in paralysis, Bhatti had sustained severe injuries, including tearing of the dura with spinal fluid leakage, a scapular fracture, and a brain hematoma, her sister Sonya Bhatti wrote in a GoFundMe page created to raise money for the college senior's medical care.
""She is currently hospitalised. These injuries are not only life-altering but will require extensive and ongoing medical care, including physical therapy, rehabilitation, and specialised support to help her navigate this new chapter,"" the page reads.
The page mentioned that Bhatti was just three weeks away from graduating from UC Berkeley with a degree in Data Science-""a milestone she had worked so hard for.""
UC Berkeley and the fraternity, meanwhile, said they are offering support to the student and her family.
""UC Berkeley is aware of an ongoing police investigation regarding reports of a student being injured near or at a fraternity. Our thoughts are with the student, their family, loved ones and friends during this time. We are following our protocols to offer support to the student and their family,"" the university said in a statement to PEOPLE.
""Our thoughts are with the individual and their loved ones during this challenging time. The health, safety and well-being of all individuals in our community remain our highest priority,"" Matt Arnold, the CEO of the national Phi Kappa Tau organisation, said in a statement to The New York Post.

This change impacts Pakistan’s earnings from overflight fees.
Amid increasing tension between New Delhi and Islamabad following a terror attack in Jammu and Kashmir's Pahalgam, several international airlines are avoiding Pakistani airspace, according to airlines' statements and flight tracker data. Among major airlines avoiding airspace over Pakistan are Air France, British Airways, UAE's Emirates and Germany's Lufthansa.
The airspace detours follow retaliatory measures between nuclear-armed rivals after a Pakistan-backed terrorist group took responsibility for the Pahalgam terror attack in which 26 people were killed, mostly civilians. In response to the attack, India has closed its airspace to Pakistani carriers. Pakistan has also barred Indian-owned or operated aircraft from its airspace.
Flight tracking data from Flightradar24 showed that Lufthansa Flight LH760 from Frankfurt to New Delhi flew nearly an hour longer on Sunday, as it took a longer route to its destination. The airline, in a statement to news agency Reuters, said Lufthansa Group is ""avoiding Pakistani airspace until further notice."" The carrier added that it is monitoring developments in the region and will update its route accordingly.
Flight tracking data showed some flights of British Airways, Swiss International Air Lines and Emirates were also turning north towards Delhi in order to avoid Pakistani airspace, after travelling over the Arabian Sea.
Citing the ""recent evolution of tensions"" between India and Pakistan, Air France, in a statement, said that it has ""decided to suspend overflight of Pakistan until further notice.""
The carrier said it was altering its flight schedule and plans with destinations such as Delhi, Bangkok and Ho Chi Minh, entailing longer flight times.
So far, British Airways, Swiss International Air Lines and Emirates have not issued any formal statements, but their rerouted flights reflect broader industry caution, despite longer distances and higher fuel costs for airlines.
The flight route alterations are set to cut Pakistan's earnings from overflight fees, which can run into hundreds of dollars a flight, depending on aircraft weight and distance covered.
Pakistan's reserves with the central bank stand at $10.2 billion, barely enough to cover two months' worth of imports, according to a Reuters report.

Aspergillus, a type of fungus that thrives in warm, damp climates, has the potential to infect millions if it makes its way into the aforementioned regions.
Norman van Rhijn, the study co-author, has warned that the world was approaching a ""tipping point"" where the spread of fungal pathogens could become the norm.
""We're talking about hundreds of thousands of lives, and continental shifts in species distributions. In 50 years, where things grow and what you get infected by is going to be completely different,"" Mr Van Rhijn told theFinancial Times.
As per the study, the species can grow quickly in high temperatures in compost, which explains why it is able to thrive in the 37C internal temperature of the human body. Additionally, fungi's resilience means they can survive and thrive in places that other organisms can't, even inside Chernobyl's nuclear reactors.
While inhaling the fungus's spores does not make everyone ill, those with conditions such as asthma, cystic fibrosis or a weakened immune system remain at risk.

What makes the situation worrisome is the fact that the fungal kingdom is largely unexplored by scientists. Less than 10 per cent of an estimated 1.5 to 3.8 million fungi species have been described, and only a tiny fraction have had their genetic material (genome) sequenced.
""Its lifestyle in the natural environment may have provided Aspergillus fumigatus with the fitness advantage needed to colonise human lungs,"" said Professor Elaine Bignell, co-director at the MRC Centre for Medical Mycology at Exeter University.
The study highlighted thatAspergillus fumigatuscould spread across an additional 77 per cent of territory by the year 2100 as a result of the world's heavy use of fossil fuels. As a result, potentially nine million people in Europe could be exposed to the infection.
While the danger is imminent, scientists say the development of antifungal medicines has been hobbled by the financial unattractiveness of investing in them, because of high costs and doubts over their profitability.

Ariana Rodriguez's discoveries include Hermes boxes, Prada shoes, a vintage Burberry coat, and even a Sohmer & Co piano, with values ranging from hundreds to thousands of dollars.
A 35-year-old mother-of-three, Ms Rodriguez started thrifting three years ago when she joined her local 'buy nothing' Facebook group. There, she discovered the world of ""stooping"" - sourcing items left out on the street. She was drawn to the idea of finding free goods, particularly for her children, aged six, three, and two.
Six months ago, Ms Rodriguez started digging through dumpsters and trash bags. She estimates that her finds could be worth anywhere from $10,000 (over Rs 8.4 lakh) to $30,000 (over Rs 25.3 lakh). While she keeps some items, including arts and crafts, for her children, others are given away or sold. Anything non-perishable, including clothes and blankets, goes to her local church to help those in need,The NY Postreported.
In her quest for treasure, Ms Rodriguez heads out with full glam. She dresses up in her best outfits for her treasure hunts, hoping to challenge the stigma surrounding dumpster diving. ""Anyone can do it,"" she tells the NY Post. ""I hope the stigmas are removed, there's nothing wrong with it.""
Some of her recent findings include a Stokke high chair worth $397 (around Rs 33,000), a bag of games valued at $200 (almost Rs 17,000), and a glass vanity worth $2,500 (almost Rs 2.1 lakh). Ms Rodriguez often resells furniture, or in the case of small trinkets, puts them up for sale.
She said her efforts also contribute to reducing waste. ""The biggest part of it is my profound desire to keep things out of the landfill,"" she shared.
Ms Rodrguez also frequently visits apartment cleanouts where people toss out unwanted furniture. She has uncovered everything from mirrors and nightstands to real gold jewellery and even money. Her most significant find was a Bally briefcase, which she believes dates back to the 1960s.
""I've found incredible pieces,"" she said, ""People get sick of furniture and just dump it.""
She faces criticism from people who say her trash diving is unsanitary, but she remains unbothered. ""It's more embarrassing to be over-consuming and throwing everything out,"" she said. Her husband, a day trader, has even joined her in the adventure, showing that this is a family affair.
Ms Rodriguez's most recent treasure includes a table worth $750 to $3,500 (Rs 62,500 to Rs 2,91,500), Jibbitz charms valued at $50 (Rs 4,100), a basketball hoop worth $35 (Rs 2,900), a bag of Hermes boxes valued at $175 (Rs 14,500), a glass lamp worth $150 (Rs 12,500), a bag of games valued at $200 (Rs 16,700), a glass vanity worth $2,500 (Rs 2,08,000), and a bedside table valued at $949 (Rs 78,800).
She believes dumpster diving is like digging for gold. ""You never know what you're going to find,"" she said. ""When you're out doing a trash dig, you'll see someone's whole life. There is a whole historical component.""

It is currently a tourist site.
Once one of the US' toughest prisons, the Alcatraz facility will now house the country's most ruthless and violent offenders.On Truth Social, the US President wrote, ""Today I am directing the Bureau of Prisons, together with the Department of Justice, FBI, and Homeland Security, to reopen a substantially enlarged and rebuilt ALCATRAZ.""
All About Alcatraz Prison
Alcatraz Prison, once a maximum security federal prison, is located off the coast of San Francisco, California. Once a fort, it was turned into a US Army military prison in 1912. It was then used as a facility for the Federal Bureau of Prisons in 1934 after the buildings were modernised and security increased.
The three-storey cellhouse was believed to be the most secure prison in the US. Its isolation, the frigid waters, strong ocean currents, and the presence of sharks made it impossible for anyone to escape it.
The main prison building had three floors and included four cell blocks, the warden's office, a visiting room, a library, and a barber shop. The most dangerous prisoners were sent to D-Block, and six cells at the end were called The Hole.
The prison corridors were named after famous US streets such as Broadway and Michigan Avenue. When the buildings were modernised in 1934, they reused the construction materials such as iron staircases, cell house doors near the barber shop, and granite blocks - originally used to hold guns - to build the wharf's walls.
They also used old prison bars to strengthen the walls before being replaced after the salt air and water caused erosion.
The Alcatraz prison was the last resort for criminals considered the most dangerous. Among the famous ones housed here were Alphonse ""AI"" Capone, also known as Scarface; George ""Machine Gun"" Kelly, who was involved in bootlegging and kidnapping during the Prohibition era; and Robert Franklin Stroud, also known as the ""Birdman of Alcatraz,"" who was convicted of manslaughter in 1909. He later murdered a prison guard.
Other criminals included Alvin ""Creepy"" Karpis, Arthur ""Doc"" Barker, Henri Young, and Bumpy Johnson.
The Alcatraz prison was closed in 1963 due to its high maintenance costs and deteriorating conditions. In 1972, the US government handed over the island to the National Park Service (NPS), which then became a part of the Golden Gate National Recreation Area.
The prison buildings were preserved and turned into a museum. Visitors could tour the prison cells and see the famous escape routes. They were also entertained with audio guides and information displays.

Families scoured hospitals and victim identification stations hoping to find their loved ones, with around 200 people still listed as missing and 89 bodies as yet unidentified.
Flames moved quickly through the Wang Fuk Court housing estate in Tai Po district on Wednesday afternoon, spreading through seven of the eight high-rises and transforming the densely packed complex into an inferno.
The blaze was ""largely extinguished"" by Friday morning after burning for more than 40 hours, the fire services said, announcing they had finished their search of over 1,800 flats for survivors.
Authorities are investigating what sparked the fire, including examining the bamboo scaffolding and netting wrapped around the complex as part of a major renovation.
The Hong Kong government said on Friday it appeared the fire had started in protective netting on the lower floors of one of the towers and that foam boards and bamboo scaffolding had contributed to its spread.
Fire services chief Andy Yeung said earlier they had discovered that alarm systems in all eight blocks ""were malfunctioning"".
""We will take enforcement actions against the contractors responsible,"" Yeung told a press conference.
Residents had recounted having to run door-to-door to alert neighbours to the danger.
At the charred apartment blocks on Friday morning, workers brought out bodies in black bags, with an AFP reporter counting four in one 15-minute period.
Vehicles unloaded corpses at a mortuary in nearby Sha Tin, another reporter saw, with families arriving in the afternoon for identification.
At one hospital in Sha Tin, a woman surnamed Wong was looking for her sister-in-law and her sister-in-law's twin, with no luck.
""We still cannot find them. So we are going to different hospitals to ask if they have good news,"" the 38-year-old told AFP in tears.
""We were already waiting at the Prince of Wales Hospital on the first day but there was no news. We also came here yesterday.""
The last contact anyone had with the twins was on Wednesday afternoon, said Wong, around the time the fire was reported.
""One building went up in flames and it spread to two more blocks in less than 15 minutes,"" a 77-year-old eyewitness surnamed Mui told AFP.
""It was very quick. It was burning red, I shudder to think about it.""
The blaze was Hong Kong's deadliest since 1948, when an explosion followed by a fire killed at least 135 people.
Lethal blazes were once a regular scourge in densely populated Hong Kong, especially in poorer neighbourhoods, but improved safety measures have made them far less common.
The city's security chief Chris Tang said the investigation into the fire's causes could take up to three to four weeks.
Hong Kong's anti-corruption body said on Thursday it had launched a probe into renovation work at the complex, hours after police said they had arrested three men on suspicion of negligently leaving foam packaging at the fire site.
The Labour Department told AFP on Friday that it had conducted 16 inspections of the maintenance work at Wang Fuk Court since July 2024, the most recent on November 20, after which the department issued written warnings to remind the contractor to ""implement appropriate fire prevention measures"".
Hong Kong authorities will immediately inspect all housing estates undergoing major work following the disaster, and will look into shifting construction sites to metal scaffolding in the longer term.
Hong Kong's government has announced a HK$300 million ($38.5 million) fund to help victims of the fire.
City authorities said they had opened nine shelters and were organising temporary accommodation and emergency funds for those who had lost their homes.
Activities around Hong Kong's legislative elections on December 7 have been suspended.
A spontaneous community effort to help firefighters and those displaced had become a well-oiled machine by Friday.
Separate supply stations for clothes, food and household goods had been set up at a public square near the towers, as well as booths providing medical and psychological care.
So much was donated that organisers put out a call on social media saying no more was needed.

US officials have identified the detained suspect in Wednesday's shooting as an Afghan national who previously worked with American forces in Afghanistan.
The 29-year-old suspect was granted asylum -- not permanent residency -- in April this year, according to AfghanEvac, a group that helped resettle Afghans in the United States after the 2021 Taliban takeover.
""I have directed a full scale, rigorous reexamination of every Green Card for every alien from every country of concern,"" said Joseph Edlow, director of the US Customs and Immigration Services (USCIS), on X.
When asked to specify to which countries Edlow was referring, a USCIS spokesperson pointed AFP to President Donald Trump's June executive order classifying 19 countries as ""of Identified Concern.""
The order banned entry of almost all nationals from 12 of the countries, including Afghanistan.
The 11 other countries facing a travel ban were: Myanmar, Chad, Congo-Brazzaville, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen.
Trump also imposed a partial ban on travelers from seven other countries: Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela. Some temporary work visas from those countries are allowed.

The agreement comes just days after Taliban Minister for Industry and Commerce Alhaj Nooruddin Azizi concluded a high-profile visit to India seeking deeper trade and investment ties.
The MoU, signed in Dubai between Afghanistan's Rofi's International Group of Companies and India's Zydus Lifesciences, is being hailed as a landmark step in rebuilding Afghanistan's pharmaceutical capacity while expanding India's footprint in the country's healthcare sector. The signing ceremony took place at the Afghan Consulate in Dubai in the presence of the Afghan Ambassador and senior commercial officials.
READ:Afghanistan Turns To India For Trade Expansion In Sharp Snub To Pakistan
According to Afghanistan's Ministry of Industry and Commerce, Zydus Life sciences, one of India's major pharmaceutical manufacturers, will initially export medicines to Afghanistan. Over time, the company will relocate its representative office to Afghanistan and begin domestic drug production. Officials confirm that the transfer of technical data and know-how for local manufacturing has already begun.
The Afghan Consulate described the agreement as a transformative move to improve healthcare standards, reduce dependence on substandard imported medicines, and significantly upgrade technical capabilities of Afghan pharmaceutical facilities. Afghan traders have publicly endorsed the deal as a model for future strategic partnerships.
This development comes at a critical geopolitical moment. The Taliban recently banned trade with Pakistan, directing Afghan firms to wind up pharmaceutical business ties with Pakistani suppliers within three months. The new India-Afghanistan pact is therefore widely viewed as a direct setback to Pakistan, which has traditionally acted as a key transit and trade hub for Afghan commerce.
READ:""Kabul Open To Business"": Taliban Minister's Trade Pitch To India Amid Pakistan Border Crisis
Earlier this week, Minister Azizi told NDTV that during his maiden India visit, he called for a dramatic expansion of bilateral trade, investment, and diplomatic engagement. Emphasising that Afghanistan is ""open for business,"" he had assured full security guarantees for Indian companies and diplomats in Kabul.
The MoU worth $100 now stands as the first concrete outcome of that outreach, signalling Kabul's intent to diversify trade partnerships, deepen strategic ties with New Delhi, and reduce reliance on Pakistani trade channels.

He said that US President Donald Trump's plan was ""a set of issues put forward for discussion"" rather than a draft agreement, adding that it could become the basis of future agreements.
He said the Kyiv leadership lost legitimacy after refusing to hold elections when President Volodymyr Zelenskiy's elected term expired. Meanwhile, Kyiv said it cannot hold elections while under martial law and defending its territory against Russia.
The Russian leader said that although the US was considering Russia's position, there are other things that need to be discussed.
""We need to sit down and discuss this seriously,"" Putin told reporters at the end of a three-day visit to Kyrgyzstan. ""Every word matters.""
He explained that hostilities will cease if Ukrainian troops withdraw from territories they occupy. ""If they don't withdraw, we will achieve this by force,"" he said.
Putin has previously demanded that Ukraine completely withdraw from the entirety of the Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhia regions before Russia considers any sort of ""peace negotiations"", notably including areas of each of those oblasts that Russia does not occupy.
He also wants to keep Ukraine from joining NATO and hosting any Western troops, allowing Moscow to gradually pull the country back into its orbit.
US special envoy Steve Witkoff will visit Moscow next week, while US Army Secretary Dan Driscoll may be heading to Kyiv.
Moscow invaded Ukraine in February 2022, triggering the worst armed conflict in Europe since World War II.

Additional Interior Secretary of Pakistan, Salman Chaudhry, disclosed the development during a meeting of the Senate Functional Committee on Human Rights. Chaudhry also said that once the ban is imposed, it will be difficult to get it removed, per a report by Pakistani newspaper Dawn.
Overseas Employment Promoter Aisam Baig said the UAE government was worried that Pakistanis on ""visit visas, not work visas"" resort to begging in the country.
The UAE is currently only issuing visas to holders of blue and diplomatic passports.
Pakistani Senator Samina Mumtaz Zehri, chair of the Senate committee on human rights, stated that only a handful of citizens were granted visas ""after much difficulty"".
Earlier, the UAE had made it mandatory for visa applicants to provide a character certificate provided by the police.
Gulf countries and cities, especially Dubai and Abu Dhabi, are preferred by millions of Pakistani travellers and job seekers. More than 8,00,000 Pakistanis apply for visas to Gulf and Middle Eastern countries each year.
In December 2024, the UAE, Saudi Arabia and several other Gulf countries imposed an indefinite ban on granting visas to people from at least 30 different cities of Pakistan, following an alarming rise in the number of cases where Pakistani nationals were caught begging or being involved in smuggling, drug trafficking, human trafficking and other criminal offences abroad.
Podcaster Nadir Ali said in an interview, ""Saudi Arabia and Dubai were popular destinations, but have now stopped giving visas. I too had to face a great difficulty when I wanted to go for the IIFA Awards. In fact, Saudi Arabia has given a warning to Pakistan with regard to the increasing number of cases of beggars being caught.""
The UAE is one of Pakistan's largest trading partners in the Middle East, with a large Pakistani expatriate population living and working there.

Yet the episode has once again turned national attention toward the long-feared Central Jail Rawalpindi, also known as Adiala Jail, a facility synonymous with Pakistan's most dangerous and high-profile inmates.
Imran Khan has remained incarcerated since August 2023, following convictions in a web of corruption cases. The prison that holds him is notorious for housing everyone from extremists and terrorists, crime syndicate heads, foreign convicts, death-row prisoners and the country's most prominent political figures.
The jail's reputation is tied not only to its present but also to its past. In April 1979, former prime minister Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto was executed within the complex. After his death, General Zia-ul-Haq modernised the facility, adding sports grounds, rehabilitation initiatives and educational programmes.
According to Punjab Prisons Department figures, Adiala was designed for just 1,900 inmates but now holds roughly 6,000 people, including women.The Dawnhas compared the jail to Delhi's Tihar, noting that both carry a similar notoriety and have experienced significant security lapses over the years.
Overcrowding has forced thousands of prisoners into poorly ventilated, dim cells where disease, malnutrition and even death are threats. Despite jail rules mandating meals with meat, rice and dessert, the reality is different.
Food quality is often substandard due to faulty contracts.
One inmate told Dawn, ""The meat reeks of diesel rather than cooking oil. Drinking water is supplied through bore wells which makes the inmates susceptible to numerous diseases.""
Following requests from prison officials, the district administration suspended mobile services in a five-kilometre radius, extending as far as the nearby village of Gorakhpur. Local settlements are routinely searched for potential suspects.
Adiala's notoriety once drew international notice when Prince Charles visited the prison while Mirza Tahir, a British national on death row, awaited execution. His punishment was later reduced to life by then-president Pervez Musharraf, after which he was repatriated.
Imran Khan's sisters -- Noreen Niazi, Aleema Khan and Dr Uzma Khan -- earlier alleged that they had been unable to meet him for over three weeks and that they were ""brutally"" assaulted outside the facility while attempting to visit.
For two days, Khan dominated online discussion after an Afghan outlet claimed the former PM had died in custody. The Afghanistan Times alleged the 72-year-old leader ""succumbed to alleged mistreatment"" and that his body had been removed from the prison.
Jail authorities countered the report, saying, ""There is no truth to reports about his transfer from Adiala jail. He is fully healthy and receiving complete medical attention.""
Government officials also rejected the claims, and Khan's sister Aleema Khan, along with PTI supporters, ended their sit-in once police assured them that visits would be arranged.
Since his arrest, Khan's children, Qasim and Suleman, who reside in London, have repeatedly expressed alarm over his conditions. Speaking to The Independent, Qasim said, ""The conditions my father is kept in are extremely harsh. He is confined to what is effectively a death cell, with poor hygiene and no proper facilities. For almost a year now, he has not been allowed to see his personal doctor.""
In October, PTI leaders alleged that the former PM had been held in ""solitary confinement,"" adding that, ""Unlike the rest of the prisoners, the cell door of Imran Khan remains shut at all times and he is denied any human contact.""
The party further claimed his electricity supply had been cut, newspapers withheld and television service disconnected for seven months. Khan has also reportedly been barred from speaking to his children.
According to the PTI, ""All of this is not only unlawful but also in violation of prison regulations.""

https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/hong-kong-inferno-puts-spotlight-on-risky-bamboo-scaffolding-9707456?pfrom=home-ndtvworld_world_featured_articles,Hong Kong Inferno Puts Spotlight On Risky Bamboo Scaffolding,"Thu, 27 Nov 2025 13:00:19 +0530","Hong Kong's deadliest fire in three decades has spotlighted its risky use of flammable bamboo scaffolding and mesh for building work in a tradition dating back centuries to mainland China.
The origin of the blaze was unclear, but there was no hiding the ease with which the fire rapidly spread across the green netting and sent bamboo lattices crashing to the ground in flames.
At least 55 people died.
For decades in the skyscraper-strewn former British colony, bamboo has been the material of choice for scaffolding - cheap, abundant and flexible - bound together with nylon cords.
The craft originated on mainland China where bamboo, viewed as symbolising grace and moral fortitude, has since ancient times been a cornerstone of architecture, even reputedly used for scaffolding and tools in the building of the Great Wall.
Now, though, it has largely been phased out there for sturdier metal scaffolding and clamps. But Hong Kong, despite its modernity, still has around 2,500 registered bamboo scaffolding masters plying their trade, according to official figures.
The number of metal scaffolders is around triple that.
Small teams of scaffolders scrambling up vertiginous gleaming facades to sheathe a building in a matter of weeks is an iconic sight in the global financial hub.
The bamboo lattices are also often used alongside green construction mesh to prevent debris from injuring passers-by, as was the case in the tower blocks at the Wang Fuk Court housing complex in Hong Kong's northern Tai Po district.
Hong Kong's leader John Lee said a task force had been set up to investigate the cause of the blaze.
""Buildings Departments' independent review unit will investigate whether the building's exterior walls meet the fire retardant standard,"" he told a press conference.
""If there's any wrongdoing we'll pursue accountability in accordance with laws and regulations.""
SCAFFOLDING CHECKS PROMISED
He also said the government will take special action against ongoing projects, checking whether scaffolding mesh materials meet fire retardant standards and other safety standards.
In March, the government said 50% of new public works contracts would be required to use metal scaffolding going forward.
But the emphasis appeared to be more on worker safety rather than fire risks. There were 22 deaths involving bamboo scaffolders between 2019 and 2024, according to official figures.
Despite the safety push, Hong Kong's secretary for labour Chris Sun said in July that ""the government has no intention to ban the use of bamboo scaffolds at the moment.""
In October, a massive bamboo scaffolding caught fire at the Chinachem Tower in the Central business district. Again, fire consumed construction netting and bamboo poles, leaving windows burnt out and external walls badly seared.
The Association for the Rights of Industrial Accident Victims in Hong Kong said in a Facebook post that there had been at least two other fires involving bamboo scaffolding this year.
Protective nets, screens and tarpaulin or plastic sheeting installed on the face of scaffolding ""should have appropriate fire retardant properties in compliance with a recognised standard,"" says the Hong Kong Labour Department's Code of Practice for Bamboo Scaffolding Safety.
Jason Poon, a whistle-blower who has previously exposed shoddy construction work in Hong Kong, said in a Facebook post on Wednesday that fire hazard risks existed in scaffolding at many housing complexes.
He said he had reached out to various government departments last year concerning the lack of fire retardant in scaffolding nets at another complex, but he was ignored.
Reuters received no immediate response from the fire, buildings and labour departments to a request to comment.

The challenge is the first against India's antitrust penalty law that since last year allows the Competition Commission of India (CCI) to use global turnover when calculating the penalties it imposes on companies for abusing their market dominance.
Since 2022, Tinder-owner Match and Indian startups have been locked in an antitrust battle with Apple at the CCI, where investigators last year issued a report saying the US smartphone company had engaged in ""abusive conduct"" on the apps market of its iPhone Operating System, iOS.
Apple denied all wrongdoing, and the CCI is yet to make a final decision in the case, including about any penalty.
The company is asking judges to declare as illegal the 2024 law that allowed the CCI to use global turnover, not just that in India, when calculating penalties, according to its 545-page court filing, which is not public.
Apple's ""maximum penalty exposure"" at the rate of 10% of its average global turnover derived from all of its services globally for three fiscal years to 2024 could be around $38 billion, it said in the filing.
Such a ""penalty based on global turnover...would be manifestly arbitrary, unconstitutional, grossly disproportionate, unjust,"" it added.
Apple and the CCI did not respond to requests for comment.
Companies also risk fines of as much as 10% of their global turnover for antitrust violations in the European Union.
Apple cited the CCI's use of the new rules for the first time on November 10 in an unrelated case, where they were retrospectively applied to a violation by the affected company a decade earlier.
Apple has ""no choice but to bring this constitutional challenge now to avoid retrospective imposition of penalty against them,"" it argued.
The company has maintained it is a small player compared to Google's Android, which is the dominant player in the Indian market.
Apple's smartphone base has, however, become four times larger in the last five years in India, according to Counterpoint Research.
The CCI found last year that Apple was not permitting any third-party payment processor to provide services for in-app purchases, where the fee could be up to 30%.
In a private submission to the CCI, reported by Reuters in October, Apple opponent Match argued a fine based on global turnover could ""act as a significant deterrent against recidivism"".
In its court filing, Apple argued India should only impose a penalty based on the Indian revenue of the specific unit which violates antitrust law, giving an example of a toy seller running a stationery business.
It would be arbitrary and disproportionate to levy a penalty on the stationery business's total turnover of 20,000 rupees, when the contravention is only in relation to the toy business that earns 100 rupees, it said.
Apple's plea will be heard on December 3.
""Amended law is clear that CCI can consider global turnover,"" said Gautam Shahi, a competition law partner at Indian law firm Dua Associates. ""It will be difficult to convince the court to interfere with clearly laid down legislative policy.""

Conservation Minister Tama Potaka described feral cats as ""stone cold killers"" and confirmed they will be added to the Predator Free 2050 list, a program launched in 2016 to target invasive species that threaten birds, bats, lizards, and insects, according toCNN.
Feral cats are wild hunters that live independently of humans, unlike pet cats, surviving entirely by hunting, Potaka explained. To preserve New Zealand's unique biodiversity, which is home to several species found nowhere else on Earth, it is necessary to control their population.
They are wild hunters and kill native species, such as the Pukunui (Southern dotterel) on Rakiura, Stewart Island, which is now nearly extinct.
Potaka also noted that in one week, over 100 short-tailed bats were killed by feral cats near Ohakune on the North Island, and they have also pushed the southern dotterel bird on Stewart Island almost to extinction.
Over 2.5 million feral cats are living in New Zealand's forests and on offshore islands, which can grow up to 1 metre long (including the tail) and weigh up to 7 kg.
""Feral cats are now found across Aotearoa New Zealand, from farms to forests, and they put huge pressure on native birds, bats, lizards and insects,"" Potaka stated. Along with wild hunting, feral cats can spread diseases, as they carry toxoplasmosis, which can harm dolphins, affect human health and cause financial losses to farmers by infecting livestock.
""New Zealand is full of proud cat owners, and domestic pets are not part of this Predator Free target,"" Potaka added.
New Zealand's Predator-Free 2050 strategy is a government-led initiative aimed at eliminating invasive predators that threaten native wildlife. Since its inception, it has successfully targeted species such as ferrets, stoats, weasels, rats and possums.
""For the first time, a predator is being added to the list and will join other mammals,"" he said, adding that removing feral cats will boost biodiversity, preserve heritage landscapes, and maintain New Zealand's ecological identity, according toThe Guardian.
The Department of Conservation (DOC) is testing a new way to control feral cats using meat-based bait, according toThe Gulf News.
They will first use a harmless bait to attract the cats, followed by a poisoned bait containing 1080, a chemical used to kill other pests. However, the approach is controversial because it could harm other animals.
The DOC is planning ways to reduce feral cats, and by March 2026, will release a detailed strategy.

Reacting to Nuyanzin's death, social media users expressed their condolences to the family, whilst stating that his story was a lesson to others attempting similar challenges.
""It is better to prove such theories not in practice. Rest in peace,"" said one user, while another added: ""It's true. If you're not used to junky fries fast food it will indeed make you sick!""
A third commented: ""Well, if ever there was a cautionary tale, then this has to be it.""
A fourth said: ""An excellent coach and a wonderful mentor, and just a good person. The news was shocking. Condolences to the family.""
His dramatic, high-calorie daily diet included pastries and cake for breakfast; dumplings smothered in mayonnaise for lunch; and a burger with two small pizzas for dinner.
""For breakfast, I have a plate of pastries and half a cake. For lunch, I usually eat 800 grams [nearly 2 lbs.] of dumplings with mayonnaise,"" he'd said. ""During the day, I may snack on crisps, and for dinner, I have a burger and two small pizzas, either at a cafe or delivered.""

The traps belonged to the Heiltsuk Nation, an indigenous community. They set these traps to control the European green crab, an invasive species harming local animals and plants. This programme is part of their environmental conservation efforts.
Kyle Artelle, an assistant professor at the State University of New York College of Environmental Science and Forestry and co-author of a new study,said, ""The traps were starting to get damaged, and the damage did look like it could have been a bear or a wolf.
Researchers initially assumed that deep-water traps could not be accessed by wolves or bears because these animals do not dive.
The study showed that some crab traps are set in shallow water, where a bear or wolf could easily reach them. Other traps, however, are in deep water. Even when the tide is at its lowest, they're underwater and not easy to reach. ""The assumption was it couldn't be a bear or a wolf, because they don't dive. So, who could it be?""
To identify this, researchers placed cameras to see and identify the animal getting the crab traps. They thought it might be an otter or a seal. Instead, the camera showed a wolf swimming to shore carrying a floating buoy in her mouth.
She dropped the buoy on the sand and grabbed the rope attached to it. Next, using the rope, she pulled the crab trap out of the water. Later, the wolf dragged the trap to a shallow spot and opened it to eat the bait, a piece of herring.
Incredible. This wolf sees a buoy out in deep water and recognizes it's attached to a crab trap filled with food as bait. She swims over to the buoy and pulls it to shore, knowing it'll drag the trap w/ bait out, too. Voila, free meal.Animals use tools, just like us.pic.twitter.com/Sf55r8XS4g
""We were amazed. It was not what we were expecting, to say the least,"" said Artelle, highlighting that the wolves might have learned about the traps either by watching humans drop them from boats, or by first finding them in shallow water when the tide was low and then figuring out how to get traps that were deeper.
""It's a sequence of behaviours that ultimately gets her towards that goal. It's problem-solving, and it's problem-solving exactly the way humans do it,"" he added.
Artelle says the wolf's actions seem very deliberate. Even though the trap was underwater and she couldn't see it, she wasn't just pulling randomly or playing around. Instead, she had a clear plan. She even stared at the end of the rope, watching carefully for when the trap would appear.
""Future research will answer questions about whether other wolves also learn to use a rope and whether this behavior becomes culturally transmitted within this population,"" said Marc Bekoff, an animal behavior expert and emeritus professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at the University of Colorado.

https://www.ndtvprofit.com/economy-finance/8th-pay-commission-how-higher-fitment-factor-can-lift-markets-jp-morgan-explains?pfrom=home-world_ndtvprofit,No headline found,No date/time found,"The 8th Pay Commission, which will result in a significant hike in the salaries and allowances of central government employees, is also seen as one of the key factors potentially contributing to the upward climb of the Indian stock market, according to a note released by JPMorgan.
The multinational bank, in its research report dated Nov. 26, explained that8th Pay Commissionwill lead to ""consumption acceleration"", which in turn will be a key factor ""shaping the markets"" in coming years.
A jump in consumption will boost the earnings of India Inc., and healthier bottom lines are generally considered as crucial in attracting institutional investors to the Indian markets.
This 8th Pay Commission-powered consumption story, however, hinges on thefitment factoror the multiplication unit used for salary revision.
The commission, headed by Justice (retired) Ranjana Desai, will meet various stakeholders over the next several months before submitting its report to the Centre. The report will include the proposed fitment factor and other modalities for salary revision.
The panel,formally constitutedin early November, has been given an 18-month deadline by the government to submit its report.
A higher fitment factor will lead to a sharper revision in salaries and pensions, which will in turn boost the disposable income of over 1 crore central government employees and pensioners.
In 2016, however, the 7th Pay Commission's fitment factor led to a ""smaller 23–25% salary hike with minimal arrears"", leading to a ""more moderate boost in everyday spending"", it added.
Notably, the fitment factor recommended by the 7th Pay Commission was 2.57, which was higher as compared to what was implemented under the 6th Pay Commission. However, the effective wage hike was lower as the dearness allowance, which stood at 125% of the basic pay in 2016, was reset to zero.
Currently, the DA stands 58%, and is expected to at least cross 65% of the basic pay by the time the 8th Pay Commission comes into effect. Since theDA componentwill be much lower as compared to what it stood in 2016, a lower fitment factor can also result in a sharper real-wage growth for employees.
JPMorgan, citing media reports, said it sees a fiscal impact of $42 billion to $44 billion (Rs 3.7 lakh crore to Rs 3.9 lakh crore) on account of 8th Pay Commission's implementation. This will be significantly higher as compared to the estimated impact of Rs 1.02 lakh crore on the exchequer back in 2017, following the 7th Pay Commission's rollout.

https://www.ndtvprofit.com/personal-finance/rs-8000-monthly-sip-vs-rs-2-lakh-lump-sum-who-reaches-rs-50-lakh-first?pfrom=home-world_ndtvprofit,No headline found,No date/time found,"With the evolving financial services landscape in India, investors are exploring more rewarding investment options compared to traditional secure instruments like fixed deposits. Mutual funds have become popular among investors in recent years as they provide enormous flexibility and potentially higher returns. However, it’s a common dilemma for many mutual fund investors to choose between a Systematic Investment Plan (SIP) and a lump sum investment for building a sizable corpus.
Both SIPs and lump sum investments come with their benefits and risks and the returns could significantly vary due to multiple factors. Suppose you want to build a corpus of Rs 50 lakh, and you can choose between investing Rs 2 lakh lump sum or starting a monthly SIP of Rs 8,000, which investment route should you take?
To answer this question, let’s see through calculations how your money will grow in both scenarios.
Both SIP and lump sum investments could be helpful in reaching the Rs 50 lakh goal conveniently. However, the investment tenure may vary significantly.
Here’s a look at the expected growth of your investments over a fixed period to reach the target of Rs 50 lakh at an assumed return of 12% per annum:
Rs 8,000 monthly SIP:
Monthly investment: Rs 8,000
Tenure: 17 years
Total investment: Rs 16.32 lakh
Expected returns: 12%
Estimated returns: Rs 37.11 lakh
Maturity corpus: Rs 53.43 lakh
Investing In A Mutual Fund Lump Sum:
Total investment: Rs 2 lakh
Tenure: 29 years
Expected returns: 12%
Estimated returns: Rs 51.5 lakh
Maturity corpus: Rs 53.5 lakh
It’s important to note that the rate of return can vary due to market conditions and other factors from what has been shown in the above calculations.
At an assumed interest rate of 12% per annum, a monthly SIP of Rs 8,000 can help an investor to reach the target of Rs 50 lakh faster compared to a lump sum investment of Rs 2 lakh.
Over the long run, the SIP investor is committing a significantly higher total amount. After just two years, the SIP investor would have contributed a total of Rs 1,92,000, almost matching the lump sum investment. This difference in total contribution is the key factor in achieving the goal of Rs 50 lakh.
As seen from the above calculation, an investor can reach the target of Rs 50 lakh in 17 years with a monthly SIP of Rs 8,000. However, a lump sum investment of Rs 2 lakh is expected to grow into Rs 13.73 lakh during the same tenure. It will take 29 years for an investor to hit the target of Rs 50 lakh with a lump sum investment of Rs 2 lakh.
Further, it is important to note that even if you increase the lump sum investment to a higher amount, like Rs 5 lakh, then it will still take around 21 years to reach the intended corpus.
Both SIPs and lump sum investments could be rewarding in the long term. It’s important to assess risk factors and your financial condition before investing a significant amount.",2025-11-28 20:33:49,Positive

The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) is reportedly displeased with the coach's recent press conference remarks, compounding the scrutiny already mounting over his controversial team methods. According to a report, though Gambhir has the board's backing at present, things could change quickly if India's T20 World Cup 2026 performances at home are affected
Following the crushing defeat, Gambhir's post-match press conference has become a focal point of contention. While publicly accepting collective responsibility, the coach's defiant stance and his perceived attempt to shift blame or offer contradictions have not gone down well with the BCCI hierarchy.
According to a report in theHindustan Times, Gambhir's forthright comments, particularly on the pitch conditions after the Kolkata Test, were seen as adding unnecessary fuel to the fire. The report suggests the Board is unhappy with the tone and content of his public statements, adding a layer of off-field drama to the team's on-field slump.
As the public sentiment increasingly turns against Gambhir, the head coach doesn't have a lot of time before the board turns its back on him, too.
India's Test record, especially at home, has been the primary concern for the top bosses. Under Gambhir's leadership, the team has suffered multiple home series defeats, an unthinkable scenario for Indian cricket under Gambhir's predecessors likeRahul DravidandRavi Shastri.
A major point of criticism from former players and experts is Gambhir's over-reliance on all-rounders/part-timers at the expense of specialist batters and bowlers. This tactical approach is believed to have sacrificed stability and depth, undermining the foundation required for success in the five-day format.
The pressure from dismal performances in the red-ball format is rising on Gambhir, and it won't be long before he loses the backing he currently has. India are not scheduled to play a home Test series until August 2026, hence, the BCCI is not keen to dismiss the coach from the Test format just yet.
Gambhir's success as the team's white-ball coach does play a role in the confidence the BCCI has in him. But the coach needs to keep the pendulum swinging in the T20 World Cup, too.
