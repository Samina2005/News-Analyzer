Trump ""will honor American Veterans, active-duty servicemembers, and military history with a military parade!"" White House spokeswoman Anna Kelly wrote on X. In addition to the parade, the celebration of the service's birthday will feature fireworks and a festival on the National Mall, US Army spokeswoman Heather Hagan said. ""Given the significant milestone of 250 years, the Army is exploring options to make the celebration even bigger, with more capability demonstrations, additional displays of equipment, and more engagement with the community,"" Hagan said. ""Parade planning is actively underway, and we anticipate approximately 150 vehicles, 50 aircraft, and 6,600 soldiers,"" she added. Trump had floated the idea of holding a military parade in Washington during his first term after attending a Bastille Day parade in France.  It never materialized, however, after the Pentagon said it could cost $92 million and concerns were raised that tanks and other heavy military vehicles would damage the city's streets. Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser raised similar concerns last month when asked by reporters about plans for a parade. ""Military tanks on our streets would not be good,"" Bowser said. ""If military tanks were used they should be accompanied with many millions of dollars to repair the roads."" - 'We never celebrate anything' - The last major US military parade in Washington was held in 1991 to celebrate the end of the Gulf War. The new parade announcement came a day after Trump said he was declaring May 8 to be Victory Day for World War II and changing Veterans Day -- observed on November 11 -- to Victory Day for World War I. In a post on his Truth Social platform, the US president downplayed the role of European countries -- many of which suffered far more casualties and devastation than the United States -- in the two global conflicts. ""We won both Wars, nobody was close to us in terms of strength, bravery, or military brilliance, but we never celebrate anything -- That's because we don't have leaders anymore, that know how to do so! We are going to start celebrating our victories again!"" Trump wrote. Trump has had a contradictory relationship with US military forces, lauding their power but also claiming they were depleted and in need of rebuilding. He at times clashed with military brass during his 2016-2020 term in office and reportedly referred to fallen troops as ""losers"" and ""suckers"" -- something he denied. During his second term, Trump has overseen a purge of top officers, including chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff general Charles ""CQ"" Brown, whom he fired without explanation in February. Other senior officers dismissed this year include the heads of the Navy and Coast Guard, the general who headed the National Security Agency, the vice chief of staff of the Air Force, a Navy admiral assigned to NATO, and three top military lawyers. US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has insisted the president is simply choosing the leaders he wants, but Democratic lawmakers have raised concerns about the potential politicization of the traditionally neutral US military.

The Trump administration has informed lawmakers about the planned cuts at the CIA, which will take place over several years and be accomplished in part through reduced hiring as opposed to layoffs, the newspaper said. Asked about the report, a CIA spokesperson did not confirm the specifics, but said that Director John Ratcliffe ""is moving swiftly to ensure the CIA workforce is responsive to the administration's national security priorities."" ""These moves are part of a holistic strategy to infuse the agency with renewed energy, provide opportunities for rising leaders to emerge, and better position CIA to deliver on its mission,"" the spokesperson said. The CIA earlier this year became the first US intelligence agency to join a voluntary redundancy program initiated by President Donald Trump, who has vowed to radically downsize the federal workforce in the name of efficiency and frugality.  Ratcliffe previously told lawmakers that under his leadership, the agency would ""produce insightful, objective, all-source analysis, never allowing political or personal biases to cloud our judgment or infect our products."" ""We will collect intelligence, especially human intelligence, in every corner of the globe, no matter how dark or difficult,"" as well as ""conduct covert action at the direction of the president, going places no one else can go and doing things no one else can do."" Addressing CIA officers, he said: ""If all of this sounds like what you signed up for, then buckle up and get ready to make a difference. If it doesn't, then it's time to find a new line of work.""

Detectives probing the crash said a pickup truck collided with a van carrying 14 people on Thursday evening by Henry's Lake in eastern Idaho. ""Tragically, six individuals in the van and the driver of the pickup died as a result of the crash,"" a statement from Idaho State Police said Friday. Pictures in local media showed a badly crumpled red truck and a van that had been engulfed in flames. Police said an air ambulance had been called in to transport victims to hospitals ""due to the severity of the injuries."" There was no information on the identities or nationalities of those caught up in the crash. Locals quoted by media said the road is usually busy because it leads to one of the entrances to Yellowstone. Millions of tourists -- domestic and international -- travel every year to Yellowstone, the first national park to be established in the United States, which covers portions of Wyoming, Idaho and Montana. It is home to thousands of geothermal features -- hot springs, mudpots, steam vents and about half the world's active geysers, including Old Faithful.

Yunus' interim government on Friday distanced itself from the remarks made by Major General (Retd) ALM Fazlur Rahman on his social media account. In a Facebook post on Tuesday, Rahman wrote in Bengali, ""If India attacks Pakistan, Bangladesh should occupy the seven states of Northeastern India."" ""I think it is necessary to start discussions with China on a joint military arrangement in this regard,"" he added. Rahman was appointed by the Yunus-led interim government in December 2024 as the chairman of the National Independent Commission assigned to investigate the killings in the Bangladesh Rifles revolt of 2009.  Distancing itself from the former army officer's remarks, Bangladesh's Ministry of Foreign Affairs in a media release on Friday said, ""The comments do not reflect the position or policies of the government of Bangladesh, and as such, the government neither endorses nor supports such rhetoric in any form or manner."" The government urged all concerned to refrain from associating the state with the personal views expressed by Rahman, the Dhaka Tribune newspaper reported. Bangladesh remains firmly committed to the principles of sovereignty, territorial integrity, mutual respect, and the peaceful coexistence of all nations, the ministry said. Earlier in March, Chief Adviser Yunus, during his visit to China, had remarked that India's seven northeastern states, which share a nearly 1,600-km border with Bangladesh, are landlocked and have no way to reach the ocean except through his country. In his address at a business event in China, Yunus said Dhaka was the ""only guardian"" of the Indian Ocean in the region, as he invited Beijing to send goods through Bangladesh across the world. The comments did not go down well in New Delhi. It also drew sharp reactions from political leaders in India across party lines. Days after Yunus' controversial remarks, India in April withdrew the transhipment facility it had granted to Bangladesh for exporting goods to the Middle East, Europe and various other countries except Nepal and Bhutan. Bangladesh has been using several Indian ports and airports for its exports to West Asia, Europe, and many other countries. India has exempted Bangladeshi exports to Nepal and Bhutan, as such trade facilitation is mandatory for landlocked countries under the framework of provisions of the World Trade Organisation (WTO). India-Bangladesh relation has nosedived after Yunus failed to contain attacks on minorities, especially Hindus, in that country after the fall of Sheikh Hasina's Awami League government in August last year.

Mr Channi later said he had not sought proof and that the Congress stands with the government ""like a rock"" as it takes measures against Pakistan following last week's attack.  Addressing a press conference on Friday after a meeting of the Congress Working Committee (CWC) - the party's highest decision-making body - in which a strong resolution urging the Centre to penalise Pakistan for the Pahalgam attack was passed, Mr Channi said the surgical strike ""could not be seen"". Appearing to confuse the 2019 Balakot air strike and the 2016 surgical strike, Mr Channi, who is a former Punjab chief minister, said in Hindi, ""If a bomb is dropped on our country, would we not know? They say we had conducted a surgical strike in Pakistan... nothing happened, the surgical strikes could not be seen, nobody found out."" Asked if he was seeking proof of the strike, Mr Channi continued, ""I have been demanding it since the beginning. But the need of the hour is to heal the wounds of the people of our country. We demand that (the Centre) do something, identify (those behind the Pahalgam attack) and punish them."" The BJP pounced on Mr Channi's remarks and accused him and the Congress of questioning the armed forces. Party leader and Delhi Minister Manjinder Singh Sirsa said in Hindi, ""The Congress has questioned the Army and the Air Force again. Charanjit Singh Channi has said again that he does not believe that the surgical strike was carried out and that he wants proof. What kind of mindset does the Congress and the Gandhi family have that they repeatedly accuse the Army and Air Force of lying and say that Pakistan is telling the truth? This is despite Pakistan itself saying the surgical strike was carried out."" Mr Sirsa also accused the Congress MP of indulging in politics at a time when people have lost their lives in a terror attack. ""If you want proof so badly, visit Pakistan with (Congress MP and Leader of the Opposition) Rahul Gandhi and check where the surgical strike was done,"" he added. BJP Spokesperson Pradeep Bhandari also accused the Congress of ""defending Pakistani terror"".

Rahul Gandhi's Congress continues to defend Pakistani terror! Now Charanjeet Singh Channi questions our forces. Why is Congress demoralising our forces at this critical time. Congress is taking orders directly from Pakistan!"" Later in the evening, Mr Channi said he had not sought proof of the surgical strike. ""I have said earlier as well that the Congress party, in this hour of grief, is standing by the government. If the government disrupts their (Pakistan's) water supply, air or whatever action it takes, we are standing like a rock with it,"" he was quoted as saying by news agency PTI. ""You talked about surgical strikes. We do not ask for proof and no evidence has been sought for it.... The issue today is that we want justice for the families of the victims and the country. We are standing with the government,"" he said. Uri Attack, Response In September 2016, the Army's brigade headquarters was attacked near the town of Uri in Jammu and Kashmir by four terrorists from the Pakistan-based terror organisation Jaish-e-Mohammed. The terrorists lobbed grenades and opened fire, after which a gunbattle began. The attack claimed the lives of 19 soldiers and over 20 others were injured. Days later, on September 29, Indian Army teams crossed the Line of Control and attacked terror launch pads in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. Several terrorists were killed in the surgical strike and the Army said it had taken the action because it had received intelligence that terrorist attacks were being planned against India. Congress Resolution In its resolution, the Congress Working Committee said this was the time to teach Pakistan a lesson and curb terrorism effectively. ""The masterminds and perpetrators of this cowardly attack must face full consequences for their actions. The Congress urges the Government of India to act with firmness, strategic clarity and international coordination to isolate and penalise Pakistan for its continued export of terror into our territory,"" the resolution stated. ""The entire country awaits accountability, answers and justice. In the face of such an unforgivable provocation, the Congress believes this is not a time for politics but a moment that calls for unity, strength, and national resolve,"" the CWC said.",2025-05-03 04:59:27,Negative

Joseph Czuba, 73, stabbed and killed Wadee Alfayoumi and knifed Hanan Shaheen days after U.S. ally Israel began its war on Gaza following Palestinian Hamas militants' October 7, 2023, attack on southern Israel. Prosecutors said the stabbing - one of the earliest and worst hate crime incidents in the U.S. since the start of the war - was sparked by anti-Muslim hatred. U.S. rights advocates have noted rising Islamophobia, anti-Arab hate and antisemitism. Czuba, who was the landlord for Shaheen and her son, stabbed the boy 26 times with a military-style knife with a 7-inch (18-cm) serrated blade, authorities said. Shaheen suffered multiple stab wounds in the attack that occurred in Plainfield Township, about 40 miles (64 km) southwest of Chicago.  Czuba was found guilty in late February. Shaheen testified during the trial that Czuba told her ""you, as a Muslim, must die."" Other recent incidents raising alarm in the U.S. about anti-Arab and anti-Palestinian prejudice include the attempted drowning of a 3-year-old Palestinian American girl and the stabbing of a Palestinian American man, both in Texas. Incidents raising alarm over antisemitism and anti-Israel attitudes include an unsuccessful plot to attack a New York Jewish center and an arson attack on Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro's residence. Hate incidents have also been reported during protests and counter-protests related to the war.

Mark Carney led the Liberal Party to a dramatic fourth mandate in elections on Monday after a campaign focused on the US president's threats to Canada's economy and sovereignty. Liberals fell just short of the 172 seats needed for majority control of parliament, but with 168 confirmed wins they will be in a strong position to pass legislation. At his first press conference since his victory, Mark Carney struck a determined note. Known for weighing his words carefully, he said that he was ""in politics to do great things, not to be something.""  ""And now that Canadians have honored me with a mandate to bring about big changes quickly, I will work relentlessly to fulfill that trust."" Canada's strained relations with the United States -- its historically close ally and biggest trading partner -- were his ""immediate priorities,"" he said, announcing a trip to Washington next Tuesday to meet with Trump on trade and security issues. Canadians, he noted, elected him ""to stand up to President Trump,"" adding that he will act ""with focus and determination."" ""Our focus will be on both immediate trade pressures and the broader future economic and security relationship between our two sovereign nations,"" said Carney. But he warned also not to expect any ""white smoke"" from their first meeting signaling a sudden breakthrough. Carney reiterated his message from throughout the campaign that he believes the old relationship between the two North American neighbors ""based on steadily increasing integration is over."" ""The questions now are how our nations will cooperate in the future,"" he said. Trump ""respects strength,"" he added, explaining that this was why he was preparing the country for major changes. The Conservatives, the main opposition party, as well as the Bloc Quebecois (the third-largest party in Parliament), both called for unity after the elections. Carney, who previously headed the Bank of Canada and the Bank of England, promised to maintain tariffs on American products as long as Washington's measures were in place. - 'Economic destiny' - ""This will be an incredibly exciting time as we take control of our economic destiny to create a new Canadian economy,"" Carney said. To this end, he promised to abolish existing trade barriers between provinces in Canada by July 1, and to strengthen trade with ""reliable allies."" ""Canada has what the world needs, and we uphold the values the world respects,"" he said. He announced also that he would unveil his new minority Liberal government in the week of May 12 and that parliament would return on May 26. King Charles III -- Canada's head of state, as it is a British Commonwealth country -- will deliver the opening speech, Carney said. ""This is a historic honor which matches the weigh of our times,"" he emphasized. ""It clearly demonstrates the sovereignty of our country,"" he said in a pointed reference to Trump's ambitions to make Canada the 51st American state. The ceremonial speech, which marks the opening of a new session of the Canadian Parliament, is usually delivered by the governor general, who is the King's representative in the country.

The statement came as the state entered a second year of living under immense hardships after the outbreak of ethnic violence between the Meitei community and the Kuki tribes on May 3, 2023. Recalling how the violence began two years ago to this day, the Meitei Alliance alleged armed aggression from Kuki militant groups funded by drug money carried out strategically orchestrated attacks to disrupt communal harmony and coerce the Manipur government into stopping its actions against cross-border drug trafficking, illegal opium poppy cultivation, encroachments on protected forest lands, and illegal immigration from Myanmar. ""Since then, Manipur has endured sustained unrest, severely affecting peace, security, and normal life across the state... Despite assuming control over the state's law and order situation, the central government's delayed and inadequate response allowed Kuki militants - operating under the SoO agreement - to carry out coordinated attacks against Meitei civilians,"" the Meitei Alliance said in the statement. ""The subsequent establishment of buffer zones by central forces, ostensibly to prevent further violence, inadvertently facilitated the creation of de facto enclaves that have since served as launchpads for continued terrorist operations targeting civilians,"" it said. The Meitei Alliance put forward seven points of actions that it suggested the Centre should consider taking up. One of the points stressed on intensifying the war on drugs campaign, including the complete eradication of illegal opium poppy cultivation. It sought carrying out the National Register of Citizens (NRC) exercise to detect foreigners.  ""Identify and deport illegal migrants from neighbouring countries. Dismantle artificial buffer zones and ensure unrestricted movement of all citizens across the state,"" the Meitei Alliance said. The Centre's order to ensure free movement across Manipur failed after the Kuki tribes protested against the decision.  ""The people of Manipur continue to suffer under the weight of prolonged violence and uncertainty. It is time for the government to act with resolve and ensure that the fundamental rights, safety, and dignity of every citizen are restored and protected,"" the Meitei Alliance said. The Meitei Alliance is one of the two organisations - the other is a key civil body of the indigenous distinct tribe Thadou - that met for the first time on a common platform and for a common goal since the outbreak of ethnic violence in Manipur in May 2023. The Meitei Alliance and the Thadou Inpi Manipur on March 8 called the development a ""significant and historic moment"". The Kuki tribes and the Meiteis have been fighting since May 2023 over a range of issues such as land rights and political representation.",2025-05-03 05:00:03,Negative
https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/donald-trump-eyes-huge-woke-cuts-in-budget-blueprint-8315623,Donald Trump Eyes Huge 'Woke' Cuts In Budget Blueprint,"May 02, 2025 23:11 pm IST","US President Donald Trump on Friday eyed massive cuts targeting ""woke"" and ""wasteful"" spending in his first budget blueprint since he returned to power, while boosting defense and border security. Republican Trump aims to cut non-defense spending by a huge $163 billion -- or 22 percent -- in 2026 as he digs in on the conservative, cost-cutting drive led by billionaire Elon Musk. Donald Trump would also massively cut foreign aid even while stepping up defense spending to $1.01 trillion and pouring money into homeland security as part of his anti-immigration drive. But the budget proposal is more of a wish-list at the start of Trump's second term and he faces a bitter battle in Congress, with Democrats calling it a ""gut punch"" that hammers health and education.  The White House said that many of the proposed cuts stemmed from the radical efforts by Musk's Department of Government Efficiency to slash the US government. ""We're joined at the hip with DOGE,"" an official from the White House's Office of Management and Budget told reporters in a call on condition of anonymity. ""This is a pretty historic effort to deal with the bureaucracy,"" the official said. ""It is woke and it is wasteful, and dividing us on the basis of race and identity in the country and honestly weaponized against it."" The White House provided an entire fact sheet on cuts to ""woke programs"", saying it was ""eliminating radical gender and racial ideologies that poison the minds of Americans"" and countering ""cultural Marxism."" Donald Trump's budget would also confirm the blow to foreign aid that his administration has already delivered since his inauguration in January. It would formalize the closure of the US international development agency USAID, dramatic cuts to which have already been widely criticized around the world. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio posted a link to the budget proposal on X, saying that thanks to Trump ""common sense leadership has been restored."" ""For far too long, Americans have had little to no return on their investment. Their tax dollars have been sent to unaccountable NGO's overseas to fund programs that do not serve our nation's interests. That's over,"" he said. 'Heartless' The boosts for the Pentagon and Homeland Security however reflect Trump's national security policies. US defense spending would rise 13 percent to what the OMB official called ""truly historic"" levels comparable to those last seen under Republican president Ronald Reagan in the 1980s. Homeland Security spending would rise a giant 65 percent as part of Trump's policy priority of cracking down on what he calls an ""invasion"" of undocumented migrants. Together the spending boost would ""at long last, fully secure our border,"" OMB chief Russ Vought said in a letter to Congress accompanying the budget proposal. The so-called ""skinny budget"" is often described as a wish-list that comes ahead of full budget proposals later in the year that must be agreed with Congress. But it is a revealing summary of Trump's focus in his new term, in which he has already sought to reshape the US government in his image. The Republican leader of the House of Representatives, Mike Johnson, hailed it as a ""bold blueprint."" But Republican leaders are already struggling to pass what Trump has called a ""big, beautiful bill"" for sweeping tax cuts. Top Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer said his party would ""fight this heartless budget with everything we've got."" ""Donald Trump's days of pretending to be a populist are over. His policies are nothing short of an all out assault on hardworking Americans,"" Schumer said in a statement.

Prince Harry, 40, stepped down from royal duties five years ago and moved to California. In 2023, he published his autobiography ""Spare"", which contained damning revelations about his father, King Charles and his elder brother, Prince William.  Harry last saw his father in February last year, shortly after Charles, 76, was diagnosed with cancer, when the pair had a short meeting in London. ON HIS RELATIONSHIP WITH HIS FATHER ""I don't know how much longer my father has. He won't speak to me because of this security stuff, but it would be nice to reconcile."" ON BROADER RECONCILIATION ""Of course some members my family will never forgive me for writing a book. Of course they will never forgive me for lots of things. But you know, there is, I would love...reconciliation with my family... there's no point in continuing to fight anymore. And life is precious."" ""It would be nice to have that reconciliation part. Now, if they don't want that, that's entirely up to them."" ON VISITING THE UK ""For the time being, it is impossible for me to take my family back to the UK safely."" ""I can't see a world in which I will be bringing my wife and children back to the UK at this point."" ""I miss the UK. I miss parts of the UK. Of course I do. And I think that it's really quite sad that I won't be able to show you know, my children."" ON THE COURT CASE OVER HIS SECURITY ""There is a lot of control and ability in my father's hands. Ultimately ...this whole thing, could be resolved through him, not necessarily by intervening, but by stepping aside, allowing the experts to do what is necessary."" ""There have been so many disagreements, differences between me and some of my family. This current situation that has been... now ongoing for five years, with regard to human life and safety, is the sticking point. It is the only thing that's left."" ""Security was used as leverage. I think what really worries me more than anything else about today's decision... is that it is setting the precedent that security can be used to control members of the (royal) family. And effectively what it does is imprison other members of the family from being able to choose a different life."" ON FORGIVING ""There are things that have happened, since 2016 especially - throughout my whole life, but let's just stick (to) since 2016, there are things that have happened that I can now forgive. I have moved past that. I can forgive my family's involvement, my father, my brother and my stepmother. I can forgive the press to a large extent as well, for so many things that have happened. What I'm struggling to forgive and what I will probably always struggle to forgive is that a decision that was made in 2020 that affects my every single day and that is knowingly putting me and my family in harm's way."" ON HISTORY REPEATING ITSELF ""I don't want history to repeat itself."" ""Through the disclosure process I've discovered that some people want history to repeat itself, which is pretty dark."" ""I'm not going to share (who) at this point. I know all the names of the people that were involved in this process.

From dusty desert towns to sun-splashed harbour cities, millions of Australians will choose between left-leaning incumbent Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and conservative challenger Peter Dutton. The almost universal consensus across a slew of opinion polls leading up to election day was that Albanese's governing Labor Party would win its second term. ""No one would deny these are uncertain times. And in times of uncertainty, we usually see voters swing towards incumbent governments,"" Roy Morgan pollster Michele Levine said as polling day approached. A total of 18.1 million voters have enrolled for the election. More than a third of them have cast an early ballot, the election authority says.  Voting is compulsory, enforced with fines of Aus$20 (US$13), leading to turnouts that top 90 percent. A result could come as soon as Saturday night, unless the vote is very tight. Albanese, 62, has promised to embrace renewable energy, tackle a worsening housing crisis, and pour money into a creaking healthcare system. Trump slump Liberal Party leader and former police officer Dutton, 54, wants to slash immigration, crack down on crime and ditch a longstanding ban on nuclear power. Some polls showed Dutton leaking support because of US President Donald Trump, who he praised this year as a ""big thinker"" with ""gravitas"" on the global stage. As Australians soured on Trump, both Dutton and Albanese took on a more pugnacious tone. ""If I needed to have a fight with Donald Trump or any other world leader, to advance our nation's interest, I'd do it in a heartbeat,"" Dutton said in April. Albanese condemned Trump's tariffs as an act of ""economic self-harm"" and ""not the act of a friend"". Economic concerns dominated the contest for the many Australian households struggling to pay inflated prices for milk, bread, power and petrol. ""The cost of living -- it's extremely high at the moment. So, taxes as well, is also another really big thing. Petrol prices, all the basic stuff,"" human resources manager Robyn Knox told AFP in Brisbane. Small business owner Jared Bell had similar concerns. ""Our grocery shops are definitely way more expensive than they were a couple years ago,"" he said. Campaign stumbles Both Albanese and Dutton tried to tout themselves as men of the people but were stumped when asked the price of eggs in a nationally televised debate. Coal-mining superpower Australia will choose between two leaders with sharply contrasting ideas on climate change and emissions reduction. Albanese's government has embraced the global push towards decarbonisation, warning of a future in which iron ore and polluting coal exports no longer prop up the economy. Dutton's signature policy is a US$200 billion scheme to construct seven industrial-scale nuclear reactors, doing away with the need to ramp up renewables. The 36-day campaign was a largely staid affair but there were a few moments of unscripted levity. Albanese tumbled backwards off the stage at a heaving campaign rally, while Dutton drew blood when he hit an unsuspecting cameraman in the head with a stray football. It remains to be seen whether Albanese or Dutton will command an outright majority, or whether they are forced to cobble together a coalition with the support of minor parties. Growing disenchantment among voters has emboldened independents pushing for greater transparency and climate progress. Polls have suggested 10 or more unaligned crossbenchers could hold the balance of power -- making a rare minority government a distinct possibility.

https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/us-to-stage-military-parade-on-june-14-donald-trumps-birthday-8316837,"US To Stage Military Parade On June 14, Trump's Birthday","May 03, 2025 04:10 am IST","The United States will stage a military parade on June 14 to mark the 250th anniversary of the founding of the US Army, the White House said Friday, with the event also falling on President Donald Trump's 79th birthday. Trump ""will honor American Veterans, active-duty servicemembers, and military history with a military parade!"" White House spokeswoman Anna Kelly wrote on X. In addition to the parade, the celebration of the service's birthday will feature fireworks and a festival on the National Mall, US Army spokeswoman Heather Hagan said. ""Given the significant milestone of 250 years, the Army is exploring options to make the celebration even bigger, with more capability demonstrations, additional displays of equipment, and more engagement with the community,"" Hagan said. ""Parade planning is actively underway, and we anticipate approximately 150 vehicles, 50 aircraft, and 6,600 soldiers,"" she added. Trump had floated the idea of holding a military parade in Washington during his first term after attending a Bastille Day parade in France.  It never materialized, however, after the Pentagon said it could cost $92 million and concerns were raised that tanks and other heavy military vehicles would damage the city's streets. Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser raised similar concerns last month when asked by reporters about plans for a parade. ""Military tanks on our streets would not be good,"" Bowser said. ""If military tanks were used they should be accompanied with many millions of dollars to repair the roads."" - 'We never celebrate anything' - The last major US military parade in Washington was held in 1991 to celebrate the end of the Gulf War. The new parade announcement came a day after Trump said he was declaring May 8 to be Victory Day for World War II and changing Veterans Day -- observed on November 11 -- to Victory Day for World War I. In a post on his Truth Social platform, the US president downplayed the role of European countries -- many of which suffered far more casualties and devastation than the United States -- in the two global conflicts. ""We won both Wars, nobody was close to us in terms of strength, bravery, or military brilliance, but we never celebrate anything -- That's because we don't have leaders anymore, that know how to do so! We are going to start celebrating our victories again!"" Trump wrote. Trump has had a contradictory relationship with US military forces, lauding their power but also claiming they were depleted and in need of rebuilding. He at times clashed with military brass during his 2016-2020 term in office and reportedly referred to fallen troops as ""losers"" and ""suckers"" -- something he denied. During his second term, Trump has overseen a purge of top officers, including chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff general Charles ""CQ"" Brown, whom he fired without explanation in February. Other senior officers dismissed this year include the heads of the Navy and Coast Guard, the general who headed the National Security Agency, the vice chief of staff of the Air Force, a Navy admiral assigned to NATO, and three top military lawyers. US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has insisted the president is simply choosing the leaders he wants, but Democratic lawmakers have raised concerns about the potential politicization of the traditionally neutral US military.

Asked about the report, a CIA spokesperson did not confirm the specifics, but said that Director John Ratcliffe ""is moving swiftly to ensure the CIA workforce is responsive to the administration's national security priorities."" ""These moves are part of a holistic strategy to infuse the agency with renewed energy, provide opportunities for rising leaders to emerge, and better position CIA to deliver on its mission,"" the spokesperson said. The CIA earlier this year became the first US intelligence agency to join a voluntary redundancy program initiated by President Donald Trump, who has vowed to radically downsize the federal workforce in the name of efficiency and frugality.  Ratcliffe previously told lawmakers that under his leadership, the agency would ""produce insightful, objective, all-source analysis, never allowing political or personal biases to cloud our judgment or infect our products."" ""We will collect intelligence, especially human intelligence, in every corner of the globe, no matter how dark or difficult,"" as well as ""conduct covert action at the direction of the president, going places no one else can go and doing things no one else can do.""

Yunus' interim government on Friday distanced itself from the remarks made by Major General (Retd) ALM Fazlur Rahman on his social media account. In a Facebook post on Tuesday, Rahman wrote in Bengali, ""If India attacks Pakistan, Bangladesh should occupy the seven states of Northeastern India."" ""I think it is necessary to start discussions with China on a joint military arrangement in this regard,"" he added. Rahman was appointed by the Yunus-led interim government in December 2024 as the chairman of the National Independent Commission assigned to investigate the killings in the Bangladesh Rifles revolt of 2009.  Distancing itself from the former army officer's remarks, Bangladesh's Ministry of Foreign Affairs in a media release on Friday said, ""The comments do not reflect the position or policies of the government of Bangladesh, and as such, the government neither endorses nor supports such rhetoric in any form or manner."" The government urged all concerned to refrain from associating the state with the personal views expressed by Rahman, the Dhaka Tribune newspaper reported. Bangladesh remains firmly committed to the principles of sovereignty, territorial integrity, mutual respect, and the peaceful coexistence of all nations, the ministry said. Earlier in March, Chief Adviser Yunus, during his visit to China, had remarked that India's seven northeastern states, which share a nearly 1,600-km border with Bangladesh, are landlocked and have no way to reach the ocean except through his country. In his address at a business event in China, Yunus said Dhaka was the ""only guardian"" of the Indian Ocean in the region, as he invited Beijing to send goods through Bangladesh across the world. The comments did not go down well in New Delhi. It also drew sharp reactions from political leaders in India across party lines. Days after Yunus' controversial remarks, India in April withdrew the transhipment facility it had granted to Bangladesh for exporting goods to the Middle East, Europe and various other countries except Nepal and Bhutan. Bangladesh has been using several Indian ports and airports for its exports to West Asia, Europe, and many other countries. India has exempted Bangladeshi exports to Nepal and Bhutan, as such trade facilitation is mandatory for landlocked countries under the framework of provisions of the World Trade Organisation (WTO). India-Bangladesh relation has nosedived after Yunus failed to contain attacks on minorities, especially Hindus, in that country after the fall of Sheikh Hasina's Awami League government in August last year.

Mr Channi later said he had not sought proof and that the Congress stands with the government ""like a rock"" as it takes measures against Pakistan following last week's attack.  Addressing a press conference on Friday after a meeting of the Congress Working Committee (CWC) - the party's highest decision-making body - in which a strong resolution urging the Centre to penalise Pakistan for the Pahalgam attack was passed, Mr Channi said the surgical strike ""could not be seen"". Appearing to confuse the 2019 Balakot air strike and the 2016 surgical strike, Mr Channi, who is a former Punjab chief minister, said in Hindi, ""If a bomb is dropped on our country, would we not know? They say we had conducted a surgical strike in Pakistan... nothing happened, the surgical strikes could not be seen, nobody found out."" Asked if he was seeking proof of the strike, Mr Channi continued, ""I have been demanding it since the beginning. But the need of the hour is to heal the wounds of the people of our country. We demand that (the Centre) do something, identify (those behind the Pahalgam attack) and punish them."" The BJP pounced on Mr Channi's remarks and accused him and the Congress of questioning the armed forces. Party leader and Delhi Minister Manjinder Singh Sirsa said in Hindi, ""The Congress has questioned the Army and the Air Force again. Charanjit Singh Channi has said again that he does not believe that the surgical strike was carried out and that he wants proof.

This is despite Pakistan itself saying the surgical strike was carried out."" Mr Sirsa also accused the Congress MP of indulging in politics at a time when people have lost their lives in a terror attack. ""If you want proof so badly, visit Pakistan with (Congress MP and Leader of the Opposition) Rahul Gandhi and check where the surgical strike was done,"" he added.

""I have said earlier as well that the Congress party, in this hour of grief, is standing by the government.

Uri Attack, Response In September 2016, the Army's brigade headquarters was attacked near the town of Uri in Jammu and Kashmir by four terrorists from the Pakistan-based terror organisation Jaish-e-Mohammed. The terrorists lobbed grenades and opened fire, after which a gunbattle began. The attack claimed the lives of 19 soldiers and over 20 others were injured. Days later, on September 29, Indian Army teams crossed the Line of Control and attacked terror launch pads in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. Several terrorists were killed in the surgical strike and the Army said it had taken the action because it had received intelligence that terrorist attacks were being planned against India. Congress Resolution In its resolution, the Congress Working Committee said this was the time to teach Pakistan a lesson and curb terrorism effectively. ""The masterminds and perpetrators of this cowardly attack must face full consequences for their actions. The Congress urges the Government of India to act with firmness, strategic clarity and international coordination to isolate and penalise Pakistan for its continued export of terror into our territory,"" the resolution stated.

Joseph Czuba, 73, stabbed and killed Wadee Alfayoumi and knifed Hanan Shaheen days after U.S. ally Israel began its war on Gaza following Palestinian Hamas militants' October 7, 2023, attack on southern Israel. Prosecutors said the stabbing - one of the earliest and worst hate crime incidents in the U.S. since the start of the war - was sparked by anti-Muslim hatred. U.S. rights advocates have noted rising Islamophobia, anti-Arab hate and antisemitism. Czuba, who was the landlord for Shaheen and her son, stabbed the boy 26 times with a military-style knife with a 7-inch (18-cm) serrated blade, authorities said.

Mark Carney led the Liberal Party to a dramatic fourth mandate in elections on Monday after a campaign focused on the US president's threats to Canada's economy and sovereignty. Liberals fell just short of the 172 seats needed for majority control of parliament, but with 168 confirmed wins they will be in a strong position to pass legislation. At his first press conference since his victory, Mark Carney struck a determined note. Known for weighing his words carefully, he said that he was ""in politics to do great things, not to be something.""  ""And now that Canadians have honored me with a mandate to bring about big changes quickly, I will work relentlessly to fulfill that trust."" Canada's strained relations with the United States -- its historically close ally and biggest trading partner -- were his ""immediate priorities,"" he said, announcing a trip to Washington next Tuesday to meet with Trump on trade and security issues. Canadians, he noted, elected him ""to stand up to President Trump,"" adding that he will act ""with focus and determination."" ""Our focus will be on both immediate trade pressures and the broader future economic and security relationship between our two sovereign nations,"" said Carney. But he warned also not to expect any ""white smoke"" from their first meeting signaling a sudden breakthrough. Carney reiterated his message from throughout the campaign that he believes the old relationship between the two North American neighbors ""based on steadily increasing integration is over."" ""The questions now are how our nations will cooperate in the future,"" he said. Trump ""respects strength,"" he added, explaining that this was why he was preparing the country for major changes. The Conservatives, the main opposition party, as well as the Bloc Quebecois (the third-largest party in Parliament), both called for unity after the elections. Carney, who previously headed the Bank of Canada and the Bank of England, promised to maintain tariffs on American products as long as Washington's measures were in place. - 'Economic destiny' - ""This will be an incredibly exciting time as we take control of our economic destiny to create a new Canadian economy,"" Carney said. To this end, he promised to abolish existing trade barriers between provinces in Canada by July 1, and to strengthen trade with ""reliable allies."" ""Canada has what the world needs, and we uphold the values the world respects,"" he said. He announced also that he would unveil his new minority Liberal government in the week of May 12 and that parliament would return on May 26. King Charles III -- Canada's head of state, as it is a British Commonwealth country -- will deliver the opening speech, Carney said. ""This is a historic honor which matches the weigh of our times,"" he emphasized. ""It clearly demonstrates the sovereignty of our country,"" he said in a pointed reference to Trump's ambitions to make Canada the 51st American state. The ceremonial speech, which marks the opening of a new session of the Canadian Parliament, is usually delivered by the governor general, who is the King's representative in the country.

""On April 25, 26, during a musical event at East Point College, it is reported that a student requested Sonu Nigam to sing a Kannada song.

He referenced the terrorist attack that occurred in Pahalgam, Jammu and Kashmir, on April 22, where 26 tourists were killed.

By equating a simple cultural request to sing a Kannada song with a terrorist act, Shri Nigam has portrayed Kannadigas as intolerant or violent, which is contrary to their peace-loving and harmonious nature. His statement risks sparking linguistic unrest in Karnataka, a state known for its diversity.

The statement came as the state entered a second year of living under immense hardships after the outbreak of ethnic violence between the Meitei community and the Kuki tribes on May 3, 2023. Recalling how the violence began two years ago to this day, the Meitei Alliance alleged armed aggression from Kuki militant groups funded by drug money carried out strategically orchestrated attacks to disrupt communal harmony and coerce the Manipur government into stopping its actions against cross-border drug trafficking, illegal opium poppy cultivation, encroachments on protected forest lands, and illegal immigration from Myanmar. ""Since then, Manipur has endured sustained unrest, severely affecting peace, security, and normal life across the state... Despite assuming control over the state's law and order situation, the central government's delayed and inadequate response allowed Kuki militants - operating under the SoO agreement - to carry out coordinated attacks against Meitei civilians,"" the Meitei Alliance said in the statement. ""The subsequent establishment of buffer zones by central forces, ostensibly to prevent further violence, inadvertently facilitated the creation of de facto enclaves that have since served as launchpads for continued terrorist operations targeting civilians,"" it said. The Meitei Alliance put forward seven points of actions that it suggested the Centre should consider taking up. One of the points stressed on intensifying the war on drugs campaign, including the complete eradication of illegal opium poppy cultivation. It sought carrying out the National Register of Citizens (NRC) exercise to detect foreigners.  ""Identify and deport illegal migrants from neighbouring countries. Dismantle artificial buffer zones and ensure unrestricted movement of all citizens across the state,"" the Meitei Alliance said. The Centre's order to ensure free movement across Manipur failed after the Kuki tribes protested against the decision.  ""The people of Manipur continue to suffer under the weight of prolonged violence and uncertainty. It is time for the government to act with resolve and ensure that the fundamental rights, safety, and dignity of every citizen are restored and protected,"" the Meitei Alliance said.

Republican Trump aims to cut non-defense spending by a huge $163 billion -- or 22 percent -- in 2026 as he digs in on the conservative, cost-cutting drive led by billionaire Elon Musk. Donald Trump would also massively cut foreign aid even while stepping up defense spending to $1.01 trillion and pouring money into homeland security as part of his anti-immigration drive. But the budget proposal is more of a wish-list at the start of Trump's second term and he faces a bitter battle in Congress, with Democrats calling it a ""gut punch"" that hammers health and education.  The White House said that many of the proposed cuts stemmed from the radical efforts by Musk's Department of Government Efficiency to slash the US government. ""We're joined at the hip with DOGE,"" an official from the White House's Office of Management and Budget told reporters in a call on condition of anonymity. ""This is a pretty historic effort to deal with the bureaucracy,"" the official said. ""It is woke and it is wasteful, and dividing us on the basis of race and identity in the country and honestly weaponized against it."" The White House provided an entire fact sheet on cuts to ""woke programs"", saying it was ""eliminating radical gender and racial ideologies that poison the minds of Americans"" and countering ""cultural Marxism."" Donald Trump's budget would also confirm the blow to foreign aid that his administration has already delivered since his inauguration in January. It would formalize the closure of the US international development agency USAID, dramatic cuts to which have already been widely criticized around the world. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio posted a link to the budget proposal on X, saying that thanks to Trump ""common sense leadership has been restored."" ""For far too long, Americans have had little to no return on their investment. Their tax dollars have been sent to unaccountable NGO's overseas to fund programs that do not serve our nation's interests. That's over,"" he said. 'Heartless' The boosts for the Pentagon and Homeland Security however reflect Trump's national security policies. US defense spending would rise 13 percent to what the OMB official called ""truly historic"" levels comparable to those last seen under Republican president Ronald Reagan in the 1980s. Homeland Security spending would rise a giant 65 percent as part of Trump's policy priority of cracking down on what he calls an ""invasion"" of undocumented migrants. Together the spending boost would ""at long last, fully secure our border,"" OMB chief Russ Vought said in a letter to Congress accompanying the budget proposal. The so-called ""skinny budget"" is often described as a wish-list that comes ahead of full budget proposals later in the year that must be agreed with Congress. But it is a revealing summary of Trump's focus in his new term, in which he has already sought to reshape the US government in his image. The Republican leader of the House of Representatives, Mike Johnson, hailed it as a ""bold blueprint."" But Republican leaders are already struggling to pass what Trump has called a ""big, beautiful bill"" for sweeping tax cuts. Top Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer said his party would ""fight this heartless budget with everything we've got."" ""Donald Trump's days of pretending to be a populist are over. His policies are nothing short of an all out assault on hardworking Americans,"" Schumer said in a statement.

""There have been so many disagreements, differences between me and some of my family. This current situation that has been... now ongoing for five years, with regard to human life and safety, is the sticking point. It is the only thing that's left."" ""Security was used as leverage. I think what really worries me more than anything else about today's decision... is that it is setting the precedent that security can be used to control members of the (royal) family.

From dusty desert towns to sun-splashed harbour cities, millions of Australians will choose between left-leaning incumbent Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and conservative challenger Peter Dutton. The almost universal consensus across a slew of opinion polls leading up to election day was that Albanese's governing Labor Party would win its second term. ""No one would deny these are uncertain times. And in times of uncertainty, we usually see voters swing towards incumbent governments,"" Roy Morgan pollster Michele Levine said as polling day approached. A total of 18.1 million voters have enrolled for the election. More than a third of them have cast an early ballot, the election authority says.  Voting is compulsory, enforced with fines of Aus$20 (US$13), leading to turnouts that top 90 percent. A result could come as soon as Saturday night, unless the vote is very tight. Albanese, 62, has promised to embrace renewable energy, tackle a worsening housing crisis, and pour money into a creaking healthcare system. Trump slump Liberal Party leader and former police officer Dutton, 54, wants to slash immigration, crack down on crime and ditch a longstanding ban on nuclear power. Some polls showed Dutton leaking support because of US President Donald Trump, who he praised this year as a ""big thinker"" with ""gravitas"" on the global stage. As Australians soured on Trump, both Dutton and Albanese took on a more pugnacious tone. ""If I needed to have a fight with Donald Trump or any other world leader, to advance our nation's interest, I'd do it in a heartbeat,"" Dutton said in April. Albanese condemned Trump's tariffs as an act of ""economic self-harm"" and ""not the act of a friend"". Economic concerns dominated the contest for the many Australian households struggling to pay inflated prices for milk, bread, power and petrol. ""The cost of living -- it's extremely high at the moment. So, taxes as well, is also another really big thing. Petrol prices, all the basic stuff,"" human resources manager Robyn Knox told AFP in Brisbane. Small business owner Jared Bell had similar concerns. ""Our grocery shops are definitely way more expensive than they were a couple years ago,"" he said. Campaign stumbles Both Albanese and Dutton tried to tout themselves as men of the people but were stumped when asked the price of eggs in a nationally televised debate. Coal-mining superpower Australia will choose between two leaders with sharply contrasting ideas on climate change and emissions reduction. Albanese's government has embraced the global push towards decarbonisation, warning of a future in which iron ore and polluting coal exports no longer prop up the economy. Dutton's signature policy is a US$200 billion scheme to construct seven industrial-scale nuclear reactors, doing away with the need to ramp up renewables. The 36-day campaign was a largely staid affair but there were a few moments of unscripted levity. Albanese tumbled backwards off the stage at a heaving campaign rally, while Dutton drew blood when he hit an unsuspecting cameraman in the head with a stray football. It remains to be seen whether Albanese or Dutton will command an outright majority, or whether they are forced to cobble together a coalition with the support of minor parties. Growing disenchantment among voters has emboldened independents pushing for greater transparency and climate progress. Polls have suggested 10 or more unaligned crossbenchers could hold the balance of power -- making a rare minority government a distinct possibility.

He looked for an open space to land but had to settle for a swamp near a lagoon. The five found themselves ""surrounded by alligators that came within three meters of us,"" Velarde said, adding he suspected that the kerosene leaking from the plane had kept the toothy predators at bay. He said they also saw an anaconda in the murky waters. For sustenance, they ate a local cassava flour that one of the passengers had brought on the trip. ""We couldn't drink water and we couldn't go anywhere else because of the alligators,"" Velarde said. The five were rescued after being spotted by local fishermen and taken to hospital.

The Lucknow bench of the court said a relative's wedding overseas and a pleasure trip to another country are not considered essential reasons for an undertrial accused to travel internationally. Justice Subhash Vidyarthi delivered the verdict while dismissing a plea filed by Aditya Murti, a consultant at the Shri Ram Murti Smarak Institute of Medical Sciences, Bareilly. Murti had sought permission to travel to the United States for his relative's wedding and subsequently, to France for a related celebration from May 3 to 22. ""An accused person who has been enlarged on bail can be granted permission to travel abroad for some pressing necessity like medical treatment, attending essential official duties and the like,"" the bench clarified, adding that attending a relative's wedding does not constitute a pressing necessity. Furthermore, the court addressed the petitioner's argument that he was previously granted permission for foreign travel for non-essential purposes. ""Merely because the trial court had earlier granted permission to the applicant to travel abroad for non-essential objects on numerous occasions, he does not get a right to travel abroad for non-essential objects this time also, when the trial has reached the stage of defence evidence,"" it said.  Murti had challenged a special CBI court's April 24 order that rejected his application for the foreign trip. Murti has been facing trial in a CBI case for more than a decade and even the Supreme Court had directed the trial court to expedite the proceedings, which are currently at the defence-evidence stage.

Named WD 1856+534 b, the exoplanet is a gas giant, located 81 light-years from Earth and sheds light on how planets evolve during the final stages of a star's life. While the exoplanet was first spotted in 2020, an international team of researchers last week published their findings about it. Using the Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) aboard the JWST, the scientists stated that temperatures reached a frigid -125 degrees Fahrenheit (-87 degrees Celsius), making it the coldest planet ever directly observed. ""We were all a bit surprised - and excited - to find that it was, in fact, a planet, and a really cold one at that,"" Mary Anne Limbach, an astronomer at the University of Michigan, who led the new study toldSpace.com. The previous record for the coldest planet was held by Epsilon Indi Ab, which stands at around 35 degrees Fahrenheit (2 degrees Celsius). ""The detection of WD 1856 b, with its sub-200 K temperature, marks significant progress in directly detecting exoplanets with thermal emission similar in temperature to Solar System gas giants,"" thestudyhighlighted. Also Read | Scientists Uncover Secret To Success Of Steve Jobs, Mark Zuckerberg And Bill Gates The researchers further confirmed that the exoplanet has a mass no greater than six times that of Jupiter and orbits the remnant core of a once sun-like star, every 1.4 days. Scientists added that it was the first intact exoplanet to have been found in the forbidden zone of a star.  ""WD 1856+534 b is now the first intact exoplanet confirmed within a white dwarf's ""forbidden zone,"" a region where planets would have been engulfed during the star's red giant phase. Its presence provides direct evidence that planetary migration into close orbits-including the habitable zone-around white dwarfs is possible."" Ms Limbach said their findings provide ""compelling evidence"" that not only can planets survive the violent death of their star but also move into orbits where previously they would have not expected them to exist. Buoyed by the success, the researchers are hoping that JWST's full potential could be used to directly image even colder gas giants in closer systems with ""temperatures as low as 75 K"". This capability could provide an opportunity to explore the atmospheres and thermal properties of planets with temperatures comparable to the coldest gas giants in our Solar System.",2025-05-03 11:14:07,Positive
https://www.ndtv.com/travel/travel-smart-booking-hacks-flights-hotels-8318315,"Travel Smart: 8 Booking Hacks That'll Save You Serious Cash On Flights, Hotels And More","May 03, 2025 10:39 am IST","If there's one thing better than booking a holiday, it's saving a boatload of money while doing it. Whether you're planning a quick city break or a long-haul escape, cutting down on travel costs can mean splashing out on a few more cocktails poolside — or simply stretching your budget a bit further. Luckily, scoring a deal doesn't mean refreshing airline pages for hours or gambling on shady last-minute sites. With a few clever hacks, you can seriously cut down on the cost of flights, accommodation, and everything in between. Here's what savvy travellers swear by. Also Read:Why You Need An eSIM For Your Next Trip And How It Will Change The Way You Travel  You've probably used Skyscanner, Google Flights or Kayak before. They're brilliant for comparing prices across airlines, but don't take them at face value. Always double-check prices on the airline's official website before booking. Why? Some budget airlines charge less if you book direct, especially in Europe. Plus, booking direct often comes with more flexible cancellation policies or fewer sneaky fees. Top tip: Clear your cookies or browse in incognito mode. Dynamic pricing is real-many sites hike up prices if they know you're interested. Yes, the day you book and fly does matter. According to data from Google Flights and Expedia,booking your flightson a Tuesday or Wednesday often nets the lowest fares. As for travel days? Flying on a Tuesday or Saturday tends to be cheaper than departing on Friday or Sunday, which are peak travel days. Bonus: Early-morning or red-eye flights usually cost less too. Not glamorous, but your wallet will thank you. Budget carriers like Ryanair, EasyJet, and Wizz Air offer ultra-cheap fares across Europe and beyond — but they make their money on extras. Seats, luggage, even printing your boarding pass can cost you. Hack it: Travel with just a backpack or small cabin bag (check airline dimensions carefully), and skip seat selection if you're not fussed. If you're flying with someone, book tickets separately-sometimes two singles are cheaper than booking together. If your dates are flexible, you've got way more chances to save. Use price alert features on Hopper, Skyscanner or Google Flights to get notified when prices drop. Some apps even tell you whether to book now or wait. Google Flights also has a handy calendar view showing which days are cheaper-perfect if you've got wiggle room. Compare prices on different sites or apps. Photo: iStock Chain hotels are convenient, but often not the cheapest or most characterful. Try locally-owned stays, boutique hotels or hostels with private rooms. Sites like Booking.com and Agoda offer great filters to find these gems. If you want hotel-like perks but a better deal, check out ""soft brands"" like Marriott's Autograph Collection or Hilton's Curio Collection. They're independently run hotels that still offer loyalty perks-but with more competitive pricing. Airbnb isn't always cheaper-especially after cleaning and service fees. For short stays (1-2 nights), a hotel might actually be a better deal. But for longer trips, especially with friends or family, splitting an Airbnb can save serious money. Extra win: You can cook your own meals. Even if it's just breakfast, that's a few pounds saved every day. Also Read:8 Smart Ways To Keep Track Of The Weather And Pack Like A Pro Don't sleep on cashback websites like TopCashback or Quidco. You can often get 5-10% back on bookings from Expedia, Hotels.com, Booking.com, and even some airlines. Also, sign up for airline and hotel loyalty programmes — they're free and sometimes offer instant perks like free Wi-Fi, early check-in, or extra baggage. Even if you only travel a couple of times a year, the points can add up. Flying into a smaller or alternative airport can be drastically cheaper. For example, flying into Girona instead of Barcelona, or Milan Bergamo instead of Milan Malpensa. Pair this with cheap ground transport (hello, FlixBus or regional trains) and you're golden. Just make sure you factor in the travel time and cost so it's still worth it.",2025-05-03 11:14:09,Positive

The Museum of East Bohemia, which took possession of the items said that the hikers had found 598 gold coins, jewellry and tobacco bags, cumulatively weighing around 15 pounds. The coins appear to have been ""hidden in the ground for over a hundred years"" and are dated from 1808 to the early 19th century. The coins are believed to have been likely buried after 1921 and include currency from France, Belgium, the Ottoman Empire and former Austria-Hungary. ""When he [one of the hikers] opened it, my jaw dropped,"" said Miroslav Novak, head of archaeology at the museum. Calling the collection a ""very specific set"", the local media reported that small marks on the currency indicate that they were minted for use in former Yugoslavia, which existed from 1918 to 1992. Also Read | Scientists Uncover Secret To Success Of Steve Jobs, Mark Zuckerberg And Bill Gates Though the discovery was made in February, it was only last week that the museum officials made the information public. ""We will need to analyse the rest, but at the current price of precious metals, the value of the find can start at 7.5 million [Czech] Crowns ($340,000),""saidMr Novak. Experts are now trying to determine how the treasure ended buried up on the side of the mountain. ""To store valuable objects in the ground in the form of treasures, so-called depots have been a common practice since prehistoric times. At first, religious movements were more common; later it was property stored in uncertain times with the intention of returning later for it."" One of the prevailing theories is that the treasure could have been hidden by Nazis retreating from advancing Russian forces when they were ousted at the end of World War II.  “It is difficult to say whether this is the gold of a Czech who had to leave the occupied territory after the Nazi invasion of 1938 [or] the gold of a German who feared displacement after 1945,” said museum director Petr Grulich. “It could also be stolen goods from an antique shop, but we are not inclined to this option.” While the investigation continues, the lucky hikers will get around 10 per cent of the discovery's total value, following Czech law.",2025-05-03 11:14:21,Positive

The videos, which are just over two minutes long and are presented in Mandarin with Chinese subtitles, represent a major shift in the CIA's approach to hiring officials in China. The US views China as its main military and strategic adversary. One of the videos portrays the internal turmoil of a high-ranking Chinese Communist Party official. The video shows the official is haunted by the growing unpredictability of Chinese President Xi Jinping's sweeping anti-corruption drive. “As I rise within the party, I watch those above me being discarded like worn-out shoes, but now I realise that my fate was just as precarious as theirs,” the narrator reflects, accompanied by visuals of surveillance and hushed anxiety. The other video is about a young government employee disillusioned by the stark gap between the party's promises and the lived reality of common citizens. The protagonist toils through bureaucratic drudgery and late nights, only to return to a cramped apartment shared with his parents.  “From a young age, the party taught us that as long as we diligently followed the path laid out by our leaders, we would have a bright future,” the narrator laments. Both narratives culminate with the characters reaching out to the CIA through its secure online platform — an invitation introduced by the agency last year through a simple text video. That previous effort provided step-by-step instructions in Chinese for contacting the agency. It formed part of a broader campaign to gather intelligence from hard-to-penetrate countries like China, Iran and North Korea. Both videos can be found on YouTube and are titled in Chinese. One is called, “Why I contacted the CIA: to take control of my fate,” and the other is titled, “Why I contacted the CIA: for a better life.” Watch the videos here:  These videos reflect a more aggressive push in CIA's outreach initiatives. It shows the agency's conviction that, in spite of strict internet regulations, its messaging is effectively reaching audiences within China. “If it weren't working, we wouldn't be making more videos,”Reutersquoted a CIA official as saying. The official said that the US was not just interested in counterintelligence, but was also seeking information on advanced science, military and cyber technology, valuable economic data, and China's foreign policy secrets. China has not officially responded to the campaign.",2025-05-03 11:14:32,Positive

What Led To Deadly Stampede At Goa Temple","May 03, 2025 09:58 am IST","A stampede left at least six dead and dozens injured at a temple in the coastal city of Goa last night. The incident occurred during a large gathering at theShirgaon temple. The devotees were participating in an annual procession when panic spread through the crowd, causing a sudden rush. Eyewitnesses have described a chaotic scene at the temple when the tragedy struck. Lairai Jatra The Shirgaon temple was packed with devotees for the Lairai Devi jatra, the procession of Goddess Lairai and her siblings held annually during April or May. Lairai, who is believed to be an incarnation of Goddess Parvati, is among the seven sister deities in Goan folklore. The festival draws a huge number of devotees from across Goa, Maharashtra, and Karnataka. An elaborate security arrangement was made for the grand event last night in coordination with the temple committee. Over a thousand police personnel were deployed at the temple, including a Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP)-level officer. Dozens of other senior officers and hundreds of constables and women cops were part of the security structure. Several officers were in civilian clothes to prevent pickpocketing. The Goa Reserve Police Force was also on the ground. To ensure smooth traffic, over 300 traffic police personnel were deployed. The police used drone surveillance to keep an eye on the crowd. A Vajra Van, or riot control vehicle, was also on standby.  What Led To Stampede Midnight visuals showed a crowd of devotees gathered around a huge fire at the temple for a custom that involves sitting around the fire and making wishes. Devotees believe their wishes come true if they participate in this ritual. Some even walk on embers for a ritual called 'agnidivya'. But it is not known if people were taking part in the custom at the time of the stampede. Around 4-4:30 am, a sudden rush was seen among the crowd. Panic spread and chaotic scenes unfolded as devotees started jostling to escape, as described by eyewitnesses. Initial reports suggest overcrowding and a lack of crowd control measures led to the rush. Chief Minister Pramod Sawant said a sudden electric shock is said to have sparked panic in the crowd. But the exact cause is not known yet. The emergency services were put on alert. The police rushed to the stampede site and began rescue operations. At least six people, including a 17-year-old boy, lost their lives in the stampede while 50 others suffered serious injuries. The injured were taken to nearby hospitals. Authorities' Response Mr Sawant said the injured are being treated at the Goa Medical College and North Goa District Hospital. Additional teams of doctors were deployed at these two hospitals. The Chief Minister met the injured at the hospital and is monitoring the situation. Every necessary measure is being taken, he assured, adding that Prime Minister Narendra Modi has taken detailed stock of the situation. PM Modi also offered condolences and wished a speedy recovery to the injured. ""Saddened by the loss of lives due to a stampede in Shirgao, Goa. Condolences to those who lost their loved ones. May the injured recover soon. The local administration is assisting those affected,"" said the Prime Minister. A 24/7 helpline has been started; for medical emergencies, one can dial 104, informed Goa health minister Vishwajit Rane.

Everyone on board -- three women, a child, and the 29-year-old pilot -- were rescued from their perch atop the capsized plane in ""excellent condition,"" said Wilson Avila, director of the emergency operations center in the Beni region. The plane was flying from the town of Baures to the north-central city of Trinidad, 180 kilometers (112 miles) away, when it ran into trouble. Andres Velarde, the 29-year-old pilot of the single-engine aircraft, told local media from his hospital bed that the plane suddenly began to lose altitude.  He looked for an open space to land but had to settle for a swamp near a lagoon. The five found themselves ""surrounded by alligators that came within three meters of us,"" Velarde said, adding he suspected that the kerosene leaking from the plane had kept the toothy predators at bay. He said they also saw an anaconda in the murky waters. For sustenance, they ate a local cassava flour that one of the passengers had brought on the trip. ""We couldn't drink water and we couldn't go anywhere else because of the alligators,"" Velarde said. The five were rescued after being spotted by local fishermen and taken to hospital. People frequently use air taxis in the Beni area, due to the lack of paved roads and the poor maintenance of those that do exist.

The Lucknow bench of the court said a relative's wedding overseas and a pleasure trip to another country are not considered essential reasons for an undertrial accused to travel internationally. Justice Subhash Vidyarthi delivered the verdict while dismissing a plea filed by Aditya Murti, a consultant at the Shri Ram Murti Smarak Institute of Medical Sciences, Bareilly. Murti had sought permission to travel to the United States for his relative's wedding and subsequently, to France for a related celebration from May 3 to 22. ""An accused person who has been enlarged on bail can be granted permission to travel abroad for some pressing necessity like medical treatment, attending essential official duties and the like,"" the bench clarified, adding that attending a relative's wedding does not constitute a pressing necessity. Furthermore, the court addressed the petitioner's argument that he was previously granted permission for foreign travel for non-essential purposes. ""Merely because the trial court had earlier granted permission to the applicant to travel abroad for non-essential objects on numerous occasions, he does not get a right to travel abroad for non-essential objects this time also, when the trial has reached the stage of defence evidence,"" it said.  Murti had challenged a special CBI court's April 24 order that rejected his application for the foreign trip. Murti has been facing trial in a CBI case for more than a decade and even the Supreme Court had directed the trial court to expedite the proceedings, which are currently at the defence-evidence stage.

Named WD 1856+534 b, the exoplanet is a gas giant, located 81 light-years from Earth and sheds light on how planets evolve during the final stages of a star's life. While the exoplanet was first spotted in 2020, an international team of researchers last week published their findings about it. Using the Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) aboard the JWST, the scientists stated that temperatures reached a frigid -125 degrees Fahrenheit (-87 degrees Celsius), making it the coldest planet ever directly observed. ""We were all a bit surprised - and excited - to find that it was, in fact, a planet, and a really cold one at that,"" Mary Anne Limbach, an astronomer at the University of Michigan, who led the new study toldSpace.com. The previous record for the coldest planet was held by Epsilon Indi Ab, which stands at around 35 degrees Fahrenheit (2 degrees Celsius). ""The detection of WD 1856 b, with its sub-200 K temperature, marks significant progress in directly detecting exoplanets with thermal emission similar in temperature to Solar System gas giants,"" thestudyhighlighted. Also Read | Scientists Uncover Secret To Success Of Steve Jobs, Mark Zuckerberg And Bill Gates The researchers further confirmed that the exoplanet has a mass no greater than six times that of Jupiter and orbits the remnant core of a once sun-like star, every 1.4 days. Scientists added that it was the first intact exoplanet to have been found in the forbidden zone of a star.  ""WD 1856+534 b is now the first intact exoplanet confirmed within a white dwarf's ""forbidden zone,"" a region where planets would have been engulfed during the star's red giant phase. Its presence provides direct evidence that planetary migration into close orbits-including the habitable zone-around white dwarfs is possible."" Ms Limbach said their findings provide ""compelling evidence"" that not only can planets survive the violent death of their star but also move into orbits where previously they would have not expected them to exist. Buoyed by the success, the researchers are hoping that JWST's full potential could be used to directly image even colder gas giants in closer systems with ""temperatures as low as 75 K"". This capability could provide an opportunity to explore the atmospheres and thermal properties of planets with temperatures comparable to the coldest gas giants in our Solar System.",2025-05-03 11:14:07,Positive
https://www.ndtv.com/travel/travel-smart-booking-hacks-flights-hotels-8318315,"Travel Smart: 8 Booking Hacks That'll Save You Serious Cash On Flights, Hotels And More","May 03, 2025 10:39 am IST","If there's one thing better than booking a holiday, it's saving a boatload of money while doing it. Whether you're planning a quick city break or a long-haul escape, cutting down on travel costs can mean splashing out on a few more cocktails poolside — or simply stretching your budget a bit further. Luckily, scoring a deal doesn't mean refreshing airline pages for hours or gambling on shady last-minute sites. With a few clever hacks, you can seriously cut down on the cost of flights, accommodation, and everything in between. Here's what savvy travellers swear by. Also Read:Why You Need An eSIM For Your Next Trip And How It Will Change The Way You Travel  You've probably used Skyscanner, Google Flights or Kayak before. They're brilliant for comparing prices across airlines, but don't take them at face value. Always double-check prices on the airline's official website before booking. Why? Some budget airlines charge less if you book direct, especially in Europe. Plus, booking direct often comes with more flexible cancellation policies or fewer sneaky fees. Top tip: Clear your cookies or browse in incognito mode. Dynamic pricing is real-many sites hike up prices if they know you're interested. Yes, the day you book and fly does matter. According to data from Google Flights and Expedia,booking your flightson a Tuesday or Wednesday often nets the lowest fares. As for travel days? Flying on a Tuesday or Saturday tends to be cheaper than departing on Friday or Sunday, which are peak travel days. Bonus: Early-morning or red-eye flights usually cost less too. Not glamorous, but your wallet will thank you. Budget carriers like Ryanair, EasyJet, and Wizz Air offer ultra-cheap fares across Europe and beyond — but they make their money on extras. Seats, luggage, even printing your boarding pass can cost you. Hack it: Travel with just a backpack or small cabin bag (check airline dimensions carefully), and skip seat selection if you're not fussed. If you're flying with someone, book tickets separately-sometimes two singles are cheaper than booking together. If your dates are flexible, you've got way more chances to save. Use price alert features on Hopper, Skyscanner or Google Flights to get notified when prices drop. Some apps even tell you whether to book now or wait. Google Flights also has a handy calendar view showing which days are cheaper-perfect if you've got wiggle room. Compare prices on different sites or apps. Photo: iStock Chain hotels are convenient, but often not the cheapest or most characterful. Try locally-owned stays, boutique hotels or hostels with private rooms. Sites like Booking.com and Agoda offer great filters to find these gems. If you want hotel-like perks but a better deal, check out ""soft brands"" like Marriott's Autograph Collection or Hilton's Curio Collection. They're independently run hotels that still offer loyalty perks-but with more competitive pricing. Airbnb isn't always cheaper-especially after cleaning and service fees. For short stays (1-2 nights), a hotel might actually be a better deal. But for longer trips, especially with friends or family, splitting an Airbnb can save serious money. Extra win: You can cook your own meals. Even if it's just breakfast, that's a few pounds saved every day. Also Read:8 Smart Ways To Keep Track Of The Weather And Pack Like A Pro Don't sleep on cashback websites like TopCashback or Quidco. You can often get 5-10% back on bookings from Expedia, Hotels.com, Booking.com, and even some airlines. Also, sign up for airline and hotel loyalty programmes — they're free and sometimes offer instant perks like free Wi-Fi, early check-in, or extra baggage. Even if you only travel a couple of times a year, the points can add up. Flying into a smaller or alternative airport can be drastically cheaper. For example, flying into Girona instead of Barcelona, or Milan Bergamo instead of Milan Malpensa. Pair this with cheap ground transport (hello, FlixBus or regional trains) and you're golden. Just make sure you factor in the travel time and cost so it's still worth it.",2025-05-03 11:14:09,Positive

The Museum of East Bohemia, which took possession of the items said that the hikers had found 598 gold coins, jewellry and tobacco bags, cumulatively weighing around 15 pounds. The coins appear to have been ""hidden in the ground for over a hundred years"" and are dated from 1808 to the early 19th century. The coins are believed to have been likely buried after 1921 and include currency from France, Belgium, the Ottoman Empire and former Austria-Hungary. ""When he [one of the hikers] opened it, my jaw dropped,"" said Miroslav Novak, head of archaeology at the museum. Calling the collection a ""very specific set"", the local media reported that small marks on the currency indicate that they were minted for use in former Yugoslavia, which existed from 1918 to 1992.

Experts are now trying to determine how the treasure ended buried up on the side of the mountain. ""To store valuable objects in the ground in the form of treasures, so-called depots have been a common practice since prehistoric times. At first, religious movements were more common; later it was property stored in uncertain times with the intention of returning later for it."" One of the prevailing theories is that the treasure could have been hidden by Nazis retreating from advancing Russian forces when they were ousted at the end of World War II.  “It is difficult to say whether this is the gold of a Czech who had to leave the occupied territory after the Nazi invasion of 1938 [or] the gold of a German who feared displacement after 1945,” said museum director Petr Grulich. “It could also be stolen goods from an antique shop, but we are not inclined to this option.” While the investigation continues, the lucky hikers will get around 10 per cent of the discovery's total value, following Czech law.",2025-05-03 11:14:21,Positive

https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/how-uss-central-intelligence-agency-cia-is-trying-to-recruit-chinese-officials-8318081,How US's Central Intelligence Agency Is Trying To Recruit Chinese Officials,"May 03, 2025 10:13 am IST","The US's Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) has released two cinematic recruitment videos in a step aimed at deepening its intelligence reach inside China. The videos, which are just over two minutes long and are presented in Mandarin with Chinese subtitles, represent a major shift in the CIA's approach to hiring officials in China. The US views China as its main military and strategic adversary. One of the videos portrays the internal turmoil of a high-ranking Chinese Communist Party official. The video shows the official is haunted by the growing unpredictability of Chinese President Xi Jinping's sweeping anti-corruption drive. “As I rise within the party, I watch those above me being discarded like worn-out shoes, but now I realise that my fate was just as precarious as theirs,” the narrator reflects, accompanied by visuals of surveillance and hushed anxiety. The other video is about a young government employee disillusioned by the stark gap between the party's promises and the lived reality of common citizens. The protagonist toils through bureaucratic drudgery and late nights, only to return to a cramped apartment shared with his parents.  “From a young age, the party taught us that as long as we diligently followed the path laid out by our leaders, we would have a bright future,” the narrator laments. Both narratives culminate with the characters reaching out to the CIA through its secure online platform — an invitation introduced by the agency last year through a simple text video. That previous effort provided step-by-step instructions in Chinese for contacting the agency. It formed part of a broader campaign to gather intelligence from hard-to-penetrate countries like China, Iran and North Korea. Both videos can be found on YouTube and are titled in Chinese. One is called, “Why I contacted the CIA: to take control of my fate,” and the other is titled, “Why I contacted the CIA: for a better life.” Watch the videos here:  These videos reflect a more aggressive push in CIA's outreach initiatives. It shows the agency's conviction that, in spite of strict internet regulations, its messaging is effectively reaching audiences within China. “If it weren't working, we wouldn't be making more videos,”Reutersquoted a CIA official as saying. The official said that the US was not just interested in counterintelligence, but was also seeking information on advanced science, military and cyber technology, valuable economic data, and China's foreign policy secrets. China has not officially responded to the campaign.",2025-05-03 11:14:32,Positive

What Led To Deadly Stampede At Goa Temple","May 03, 2025 09:58 am IST","A stampede left at least six dead and dozens injured at a temple in the coastal city of Goa last night. The incident occurred during a large gathering at theShirgaon temple. The devotees were participating in an annual procession when panic spread through the crowd, causing a sudden rush. Eyewitnesses have described a chaotic scene at the temple when the tragedy struck. Lairai Jatra The Shirgaon temple was packed with devotees for the Lairai Devi jatra, the procession of Goddess Lairai and her siblings held annually during April or May. Lairai, who is believed to be an incarnation of Goddess Parvati, is among the seven sister deities in Goan folklore. The festival draws a huge number of devotees from across Goa, Maharashtra, and Karnataka. An elaborate security arrangement was made for the grand event last night in coordination with the temple committee. Over a thousand police personnel were deployed at the temple, including a Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP)-level officer. Dozens of other senior officers and hundreds of constables and women cops were part of the security structure. Several officers were in civilian clothes to prevent pickpocketing. The Goa Reserve Police Force was also on the ground. To ensure smooth traffic, over 300 traffic police personnel were deployed. The police used drone surveillance to keep an eye on the crowd. A Vajra Van, or riot control vehicle, was also on standby.  What Led To Stampede Midnight visuals showed a crowd of devotees gathered around a huge fire at the temple for a custom that involves sitting around the fire and making wishes. Devotees believe their wishes come true if they participate in this ritual. Some even walk on embers for a ritual called 'agnidivya'. But it is not known if people were taking part in the custom at the time of the stampede. Around 4-4:30 am, a sudden rush was seen among the crowd. Panic spread and chaotic scenes unfolded as devotees started jostling to escape, as described by eyewitnesses. Initial reports suggest overcrowding and a lack of crowd control measures led to the rush. Chief Minister Pramod Sawant said a sudden electric shock is said to have sparked panic in the crowd. But the exact cause is not known yet. The emergency services were put on alert. The police rushed to the stampede site and began rescue operations. At least six people, including a 17-year-old boy, lost their lives in the stampede while 50 others suffered serious injuries. The injured were taken to nearby hospitals. Authorities' Response Mr Sawant said the injured are being treated at the Goa Medical College and North Goa District Hospital. Additional teams of doctors were deployed at these two hospitals. The Chief Minister met the injured at the hospital and is monitoring the situation. Every necessary measure is being taken, he assured, adding that Prime Minister Narendra Modi has taken detailed stock of the situation. PM Modi also offered condolences and wished a speedy recovery to the injured. ""Saddened by the loss of lives due to a stampede in Shirgao, Goa. Condolences to those who lost their loved ones. May the injured recover soon. The local administration is assisting those affected,"" said the Prime Minister. A 24/7 helpline has been started; for medical emergencies, one can dial 104, informed Goa health minister Vishwajit Rane. Goa Medical College and other district hospitals are fully equipped, and 10 advanced ambulances have been deployed, he said.",2025-05-03 11:14:36,Positive

Questioning the security arrangements in Jammu and Kashmir after the April 22Pahalgam attack, Mr Siddaramiah had said, ""There is no necessity to wage a war against Pakistan. Strict security measures must be initiated. We are not in favour of waging war. There should be peace, people must feel secure, and the Central government should ensure effective security arrangements.""  He later issued a clarification and said that war should always be a nation's last resort. ""Only when every other means to defeat the enemy has failed, should a country be compelled to go to war... The central government has already initiated certain diplomatic steps, including revisiting the Indus Waters Treaty - a move we wholeheartedly welcome. We trust that even sterner actions are on the horizon. Not every move needs to be broadcast to the world; rest assured, the nation stands fully united behind every strong and decisive step taken,"" he said. ""At this crucial moment, nations across the world have come out in strong condemnation of Pakistan-sponsored terrorism, standing firmly with India. We must seize this unprecedented global support and teach Pakistan a lesson so profound that they dare not commit such reckless acts ever again,"" he added. Mr Siddaramaiah's remarks were covered by Pakistani media, prompting the BJP to launch a scathing attack on the Congress veteran. Therelations between India and Pakistanhave soured after the terror attack in Pahalgam left 26 people dead.

The meeting is aimed at building a unified political stance on the state's long-standing contention with Punjab regarding water allocation from the Bhakra system. The ongoing row was triggered by the Bhakra Beas Management Board's (BBMB) decision to release 8,500 cusecs of water from the reservoir to Haryana, which is an additional 4,500 cusecs. The Haryana government, led by the BJP, seeks to formulate a comprehensive strategy to assert its rights over water distribution. Political leaders across party lines have been invited to participate in the meeting. Representatives from the ruling BJP, Congress, Indian National Lok Dal (INLD), Jannayak Janata Party (JJP), Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), and the Communist Party of India (Marxist) have all confirmed attendance.  Notable leaders slated to attend include BJP's Mohan Lal Badoli, Congress state president Udai Bhan, INLD's Ram Pal Majra, JJP leader Dushyant Chautala, AAP's Sushil Gupta, Krishan Jamalpur of BSP, and CPI(M)'s Prem Chand. The National People's Party, though headquartered in Shillong, has also been invited to join the dialogue. The move comes shortly after Punjab held a similar all-party consultation on the issue on Friday. The all-party meeting, chaired by Punjab Chief Minister Bhagwant Mann on Friday to discuss the issue of giving additional water to neighbouring Haryana, unanimously decided that the state itself has no surplus water. They also decided to meet either Prime Minister Narendra Modi or Union Home Minister Amit Shah, to apprise them of the situation. The meeting comprised leaders from the AAP, BJP, the Congress and the Shiromani Akali Dal. Later there was a media interaction after the all-party meeting of all prominent parties expressed unanimity with the AAP government's refusal to share extra water with Haryana. Chief Minister Mann told the media that all the political parties, rising above their ideology, suggested to the government that it must save every drop of the water which is the state's lifeline. Chief Minister Mann said Haryana, which is already receiving 4,700 cusecs against its allocated 1,700 cusecs, is now set to benefit from additional 'theft' of Punjab's rightful share. Chief Minister Mann clarified that Haryana has already used 103 per cent of its share and warned of agitation ""if Punjab's rights are denied"". He said the government of Punjab has convened a special Assembly session on sharing water on May 5. Similarly, addressing the media in Panchkula on Friday, Chief Minister Saini criticised Punjab's AAP-led government for allegedly politicising the water crisis, stating that Haryana has a legal and moral claim to its rightful share. The chief minister emphasised that the issue transcends party lines and requires a united front to safeguard Haryana's interests. Interestingly, the water dispute has created a peculiar political scenario, with national parties such as the BJP, Congress, and AAP facing internal contradictions. While their Haryana units are pushing for rightful water allocation, their Punjab counterparts maintain there is no surplus water to share and Haryana has already got its share of the water. The latest stand-off began on April 23, when Haryana sought 8,500 cusecs of water from the Bhakra-Nangal project, 4,500 cusecs more than what it is currently receiving. Punjab Chief Minister Mann refused, putting the ball in the court of the BBMB.

""Every time I ask a question, at the end it asks another little question to see if it can get yet another question out of me."" As per Mr Systrom, the chatbots being too engaging was not a bug but instead an intentional feature, inserted by AI companies to inflate metrics such as time spent and daily active users. He added that companies should be ""laser-focused"" on providing high-quality answers rather than moving the metrics.

Police sources stated that the department is likely to formalise the arrests and make an official announcement later on Saturday. The police had formed five special teams to apprehend the killers. All the accused are being interrogated, and they were arrested from various locations within Mangaluru district. Investigators have obtained video footage of the incident, which helped in identifying and apprehending the suspects, sources said. However, Leader of the Opposition (LoP), R Ashoka, alleged that a week before the murder, Suhas Shetty was warned by police not to carry weapons in his vehicle, and his vehicle was searched. ""How did this message reach the killers? If he had a weapon, he might have survived. The murder took place within half a kilometre of a police presence, yet no officer rushed to the spot,"" Mr Ashoka stated. ""A week before, the killers had put up a message saying Suhas Shetty will be finished. After the murder they had put up another message celebrating the murder,"" he said. Union Minister of State Shobha Karandlaje and Mangaluru BJP MP Captain Brijesh Chowta have appealed to Union Home Minister Amit Shah to transfer the case to the National Investigation Agency (NIA).  BJP State President BY Vijayendra has announced a compensation of Rs 25 lakh for Suhas Shetty's family. BJP MLC CT Ravi and other party leaders warned that if police fail to act, revenge killings will continue in Mangaluru. ""There is no one who has the mindset to let Suhas' murderers go free,"" Mr Ravi said. Multiple stabbing incidents have been reported from the Mangaluru and Udupi districts in the coastal Karnataka region following Shetty's murder, and the situation remains tense and volatile. Karnataka Home Minister G Parameshwara is visiting Mangaluru on Saturday to assess the situation and review the law and order situation. He is expected to hold a meeting with senior officers at the Mangaluru Police Commissionerate. According to the investigation, the accused first rammed a goods vehicle into the car in which Suhas Shetty was travelling. Then, a gang of assailants, who were following in a Swift car, emerged with weapons and brutally hacked him to death. LoP R Ashoka alleged that members of the banned Popular Front of India (PFI) and the Karnataka Forum for Dignity were responsible for Shetty's murder. Suhas Shetty was a Bajrang Dal activist and the prime accused in the murder of Mohammad Fazil, a resident of Surathkal. Shetty and his associates allegedly killed Fazil in a public place on July 28, 2022, in retaliation for the murder of BJP youth worker Praveen Kumar Nettaru. Nettaru, a BJP activist from the same communally sensitive region, was hacked to death during the height of the 'hijab' row. His murder had triggered a series of revenge killings and multiple stabbing incidents across Karnataka. Mangaluru also recently witnessed the mob lynching of a man from Kerala, identified as Mohammad Ashraf, who was allegedly heard shouting ""Pakistan Zindabad"" during a cricket tournament. Police are currently investigating whether there is any connection between the murder of Suhas Shetty and the recent lynching incident.

Mr Patra coined an analogy, saying, ""On the outside, it may be the Congress Working Committee (CWC), but on the inside, it's a Pakistan Working Committee (PWC)."" Mr Patra criticised Congress MP and former Punjab Chief Minister Charanjit Singh Channi for questioning the authenticity of the 2019 Indian Armed Force surgical strike carried out in response to the Pulwama terror attack. ""The Congress Party, after its Working Committee meeting, held a separate press conference strategically led by Channi, who cast doubt on the very existence of the surgical strikes. This isn't just irresponsible, it's dangerous,"" Mr Patra said. Highlighting a recent terrorist attack at Pahalgam in Jammu and Kashmir, Mr Patra questioned the Congress' seriousness towards national security. ""Even if the Congress party does not take terrorist attacks seriously, even if the sentiments of the people of the country are disregarded by the Congress party, Rahul Gandhi, former party President Sonia Gandhi and the Gandhi family, but they do not have the liberty to repeatedly demoralise the nation's armed forces or to play with the sentiments of the people,"" he added. Further escalating his attack, Mr Patra referenced recent statements from Pakistan's Parliament, where a PTI senator, Saifullah Abro, praised Indian Opposition parties like the Aam Aadmi Party and Samajwadi Party for criticising Prime Minister Modi rather than condemning terrorism.  ""In Pakistan's Parliament, PTI Senator Saifullah Abro stated that the entire Indian Opposition is condemning the Pahalgam attack whether it is Delhi's Aam Aadmi Party or Uttar Pradesh's Samajwadi Party. No one is supporting Modi; everyone is opposing him. They are saying that Modi has always been against Muslims and now he won't get any cover. In Pakistan's Parliament, there is praise for Akhilesh Yadav and Arvind Kejriwal,"" he said. ""So Rahul Gandhi thought, why stay behind? That's why he pushed Charanjit Singh Channi to hold a press conference which is now also being praised in Pakistan,"" Mr Patra claimed. He said that the Congress Party's actions amount to providing ""oxygen"" to Pakistan-sponsored terrorism. ""This isn't just political posturing; it's a betrayal of national interest. The Congress must answer why it continues to speak Pakistan's language on Indian soil,"" Mr Patra said.

There's little doubt over the outcome of the ballot that will likely name a senior SpaceX representative as mayor of the new settlement. Most of the 283 eligible voters are SpaceX employees working at the site on Boca Chica Bay bordering Mexico, or have connections to the company whose billionaire chief has long eyed a human mission to Mars. Most ballots have already been cast ahead of the 7:00 pm (0100 GMT) deadline on Saturday. Musk himself is registered to vote, Cameron County Election Coordinator Remi Garza told AFP, but the South African-born embattled 53-year-old had yet to cast his ballot when the early voting period closed on April 29.  Nearly 500 people live around the base in Cameron County, on land mostly owned by SpaceX or its employees, official documents show. The change would allow Starbase to control building and permitting and avoid other regulatory hurdles, while collecting taxes and writing local law. The vote comes at a difficult time for Musk, who is expected to reduce his role as the unofficial head of US President Donald Trump's cost-cutting ""Department of Government Efficiency"" to instead focus more on his troubled car company, Tesla. The vote on Saturday includes a mayoral election, but Bobby Peden, vice president of testing and launch at SpaceX, according to LinkedIn, is the only candidate on the ballot for this position. The Texas base launched in 2019 and is a key testing site for the company's rocket launches. Not everyone is upbeat about the prospect of a SpaceX town. Bekah Hinojosa, co-founder of the South Texas Environmental Justice Network, voiced concerns over the environmental impact, warning of ""more environmental destruction."" ""They would attempt more illegal dumping, they would build up their dangerous rocket operations and cause more seismic activity, cause our homes to shake, and that they would destroy more of the wildlife habitat in the region,"" she told AFP. - Environmental concerns - It was Musk himself who proposed the name Starbase in a social media post during a visit to the site four years ago. Then, last December, general manager of SpaceX Kathryn Lueders appealed to local authorities to grant the site city status. Lueders argued in her letter that SpaceX already maintained infrastructure there like roads, education services and medical care. Lueders promised the creation of the new city would not undermine SpaceX efforts to mitigate the base's environmental impact. SpaceX did not respond to an AFP request for comment. The hub overlooks the Gulf of Mexico -- renamed the Gulf of America by Trump -- and there is controversy over access to Boca Chica Beach. A Texas House State Affairs committee rejected a bill this week by Republican lawmakers that would have given coastal cities with spaceports control over beach access. Hinojosa, the activist, said SpaceX has limited access to Boca Chica Beach for many years and told AFP she worried the vote could cut access entirely to a beach ""our families have been going to for generations."" The Carrizo/Comecrudo Nation of Texas, descendants of an Indigenous tribe in the area, has also complained. In 2024, the Environmental Protection Agency and Texas authorities found that SpaceX was responsible for repeated spills and releasing pollutants into Texas waterways. In response to reports that its rockets had caused damage to wild bird nests, Musk quipped on social media: ""To make up for this heinous crime, I will refrain from having omelette for a week.""

For 18 years, starting in 2001, California-based Tim Friede got himself knowingly bitten by some of the most venomous snakes on the planet in hopes of finding a cure for all snake bites. According to a report inCNN, antibodies found in Mr Friede's blood have now been shown to protect against fatal doses from a wide range of species in animal tests. Immunologist Jacob Glanville first heard about Mr Friede through media reports in 2017 and decided that there was an opportunity to do something groundbreaking. ""We had this conversation. And I said, I know it's awkward, but I'm really interested in looking at some of your blood,"" said Mr Glanville. ""And he [Tim Friede] said, 'Finally, I've been waiting for this call.'"" As the pair began working together, Mr Friede donated a 40-millilitre blood sample to Mr Glanville and his colleagues. Eight years later, Mr Glanville and Peter Kwong, Richard J. Stock, Professor of medical sciences at Columbia University's Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons havepublisheddetails of the antivenom that can protect against the bites from 19 species of poisonous snakes.  Currently, antivenom is made by injecting small doses of snake venom into animals, such as horses. Once the immune system fights the venom and produces the antibodies, scientists harvest them to be used as antivenom. However, venom and antivenom have to be closely matched. For example, antivenom made from snakes in India may not be as effective against the same species in Thailand. Also Read | Coldest Exoplanet Orbiting A Dead Star Found By Scientists While the antivenom cocktail prepared using MrFriede's blood has not been tested in humans yet, experts predict that the human origin of the antibodies would mean fewer side effects than antivenoms made the traditional way. ""Tim's antibodies are really quite extraordinary - he taught his immune system to get this very, very broad recognition,"" said Prof Kwong. Notably, Mr Friede gave up on injecting himself with snake venom in 2018 after some close calls. He is now employed by Glanville's biotechnology company Centivax and contributing to the research. As per the World Health Organization (WHO), every year, venomous snake bites kill tens of thousands of people globally and permanently disable several hundred thousand more.",2025-05-03 13:26:31,Positive

Questioning the security arrangements in Jammu and Kashmir after the April 22Pahalgam attack, Mr Siddaramiah had said, ""There is no necessity to wage a war against Pakistan. Strict security measures must be initiated. We are not in favour of waging war. There should be peace, people must feel secure, and the Central government should ensure effective security arrangements.""  He later issued a clarification and said that war should always be a nation's last resort. ""Only when every other means to defeat the enemy has failed, should a country be compelled to go to war... The central government has already initiated certain diplomatic steps, including revisiting the Indus Waters Treaty - a move we wholeheartedly welcome. We trust that even sterner actions are on the horizon. Not every move needs to be broadcast to the world; rest assured, the nation stands fully united behind every strong and decisive step taken,"" he said. ""At this crucial moment, nations across the world have come out in strong condemnation of Pakistan-sponsored terrorism, standing firmly with India. We must seize this unprecedented global support and teach Pakistan a lesson so profound that they dare not commit such reckless acts ever again,"" he added. Mr Siddaramaiah's remarks were covered by Pakistani media, prompting the BJP to launch a scathing attack on the Congress veteran. Therelations between India and Pakistanhave soured after the terror attack in Pahalgam left 26 people dead. India, citing ""cross-border linkages"" to the attack, has announced a raft of punitive measures against Pakistan, including suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty, shutting down of the only operational land border crossing at Attari and downgrading of diplomatic ties.

The meeting is aimed at building a unified political stance on the state's long-standing contention with Punjab regarding water allocation from the Bhakra system. The ongoing row was triggered by the Bhakra Beas Management Board's (BBMB) decision to release 8,500 cusecs of water from the reservoir to Haryana, which is an additional 4,500 cusecs. The Haryana government, led by the BJP, seeks to formulate a comprehensive strategy to assert its rights over water distribution. Political leaders across party lines have been invited to participate in the meeting. Representatives from the ruling BJP, Congress, Indian National Lok Dal (INLD), Jannayak Janata Party (JJP), Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), and the Communist Party of India (Marxist) have all confirmed attendance.  Notable leaders slated to attend include BJP's Mohan Lal Badoli, Congress state president Udai Bhan, INLD's Ram Pal Majra, JJP leader Dushyant Chautala, AAP's Sushil Gupta, Krishan Jamalpur of BSP, and CPI(M)'s Prem Chand. The National People's Party, though headquartered in Shillong, has also been invited to join the dialogue. The move comes shortly after Punjab held a similar all-party consultation on the issue on Friday. The all-party meeting, chaired by Punjab Chief Minister Bhagwant Mann on Friday to discuss the issue of giving additional water to neighbouring Haryana, unanimously decided that the state itself has no surplus water. They also decided to meet either Prime Minister Narendra Modi or Union Home Minister Amit Shah, to apprise them of the situation. The meeting comprised leaders from the AAP, BJP, the Congress and the Shiromani Akali Dal. Later there was a media interaction after the all-party meeting of all prominent parties expressed unanimity with the AAP government's refusal to share extra water with Haryana. Chief Minister Mann told the media that all the political parties, rising above their ideology, suggested to the government that it must save every drop of the water which is the state's lifeline. Chief Minister Mann said Haryana, which is already receiving 4,700 cusecs against its allocated 1,700 cusecs, is now set to benefit from additional 'theft' of Punjab's rightful share. Chief Minister Mann clarified that Haryana has already used 103 per cent of its share and warned of agitation ""if Punjab's rights are denied"". He said the government of Punjab has convened a special Assembly session on sharing water on May 5. Similarly, addressing the media in Panchkula on Friday, Chief Minister Saini criticised Punjab's AAP-led government for allegedly politicising the water crisis, stating that Haryana has a legal and moral claim to its rightful share. The chief minister emphasised that the issue transcends party lines and requires a united front to safeguard Haryana's interests. Interestingly, the water dispute has created a peculiar political scenario, with national parties such as the BJP, Congress, and AAP facing internal contradictions. While their Haryana units are pushing for rightful water allocation, their Punjab counterparts maintain there is no surplus water to share and Haryana has already got its share of the water. The latest stand-off began on April 23, when Haryana sought 8,500 cusecs of water from the Bhakra-Nangal project, 4,500 cusecs more than what it is currently receiving. Punjab Chief Minister Mann refused, putting the ball in the court of the BBMB.

""Every time I ask a question, at the end it asks another little question to see if it can get yet another question out of me.""

All the accused are being interrogated, and they were arrested from various locations within Mangaluru district. Investigators have obtained video footage of the incident, which helped in identifying and apprehending the suspects, sources said. However, Leader of the Opposition (LoP), R Ashoka, alleged that a week before the murder, Suhas Shetty was warned by police not to carry weapons in his vehicle, and his vehicle was searched. ""How did this message reach the killers? If he had a weapon, he might have survived. The murder took place within half a kilometre of a police presence, yet no officer rushed to the spot,"" Mr Ashoka stated. ""A week before, the killers had put up a message saying Suhas Shetty will be finished. After the murder they had put up another message celebrating the murder,"" he said. Union Minister of State Shobha Karandlaje and Mangaluru BJP MP Captain Brijesh Chowta have appealed to Union Home Minister Amit Shah to transfer the case to the National Investigation Agency (NIA).  BJP State President BY Vijayendra has announced a compensation of Rs 25 lakh for Suhas Shetty's family. BJP MLC CT Ravi and other party leaders warned that if police fail to act, revenge killings will continue in Mangaluru. ""There is no one who has the mindset to let Suhas' murderers go free,"" Mr Ravi said. Multiple stabbing incidents have been reported from the Mangaluru and Udupi districts in the coastal Karnataka region following Shetty's murder, and the situation remains tense and volatile. Karnataka Home Minister G Parameshwara is visiting Mangaluru on Saturday to assess the situation and review the law and order situation. He is expected to hold a meeting with senior officers at the Mangaluru Police Commissionerate. According to the investigation, the accused first rammed a goods vehicle into the car in which Suhas Shetty was travelling. Then, a gang of assailants, who were following in a Swift car, emerged with weapons and brutally hacked him to death. LoP R Ashoka alleged that members of the banned Popular Front of India (PFI) and the Karnataka Forum for Dignity were responsible for Shetty's murder. Suhas Shetty was a Bajrang Dal activist and the prime accused in the murder of Mohammad Fazil, a resident of Surathkal. Shetty and his associates allegedly killed Fazil in a public place on July 28, 2022, in retaliation for the murder of BJP youth worker Praveen Kumar Nettaru. Nettaru, a BJP activist from the same communally sensitive region, was hacked to death during the height of the 'hijab' row. His murder had triggered a series of revenge killings and multiple stabbing incidents across Karnataka. Mangaluru also recently witnessed the mob lynching of a man from Kerala, identified as Mohammad Ashraf, who was allegedly heard shouting ""Pakistan Zindabad"" during a cricket tournament. Police are currently investigating whether there is any connection between the murder of Suhas Shetty and the recent lynching incident.

Mr Patra coined an analogy, saying, ""On the outside, it may be the Congress Working Committee (CWC), but on the inside, it's a Pakistan Working Committee (PWC)."" Mr Patra criticised Congress MP and former Punjab Chief Minister Charanjit Singh Channi for questioning the authenticity of the 2019 Indian Armed Force surgical strike carried out in response to the Pulwama terror attack. ""The Congress Party, after its Working Committee meeting, held a separate press conference strategically led by Channi, who cast doubt on the very existence of the surgical strikes. This isn't just irresponsible, it's dangerous,"" Mr Patra said. Highlighting a recent terrorist attack at Pahalgam in Jammu and Kashmir, Mr Patra questioned the Congress' seriousness towards national security. ""Even if the Congress party does not take terrorist attacks seriously, even if the sentiments of the people of the country are disregarded by the Congress party, Rahul Gandhi, former party President Sonia Gandhi and the Gandhi family, but they do not have the liberty to repeatedly demoralise the nation's armed forces or to play with the sentiments of the people,"" he added. Further escalating his attack, Mr Patra referenced recent statements from Pakistan's Parliament, where a PTI senator, Saifullah Abro, praised Indian Opposition parties like the Aam Aadmi Party and Samajwadi Party for criticising Prime Minister Modi rather than condemning terrorism.  ""In Pakistan's Parliament, PTI Senator Saifullah Abro stated that the entire Indian Opposition is condemning the Pahalgam attack whether it is Delhi's Aam Aadmi Party or Uttar Pradesh's Samajwadi Party. No one is supporting Modi; everyone is opposing him. They are saying that Modi has always been against Muslims and now he won't get any cover. In Pakistan's Parliament, there is praise for Akhilesh Yadav and Arvind Kejriwal,"" he said. ""So Rahul Gandhi thought, why stay behind? That's why he pushed Charanjit Singh Channi to hold a press conference which is now also being praised in Pakistan,"" Mr Patra claimed. He said that the Congress Party's actions amount to providing ""oxygen"" to Pakistan-sponsored terrorism. ""This isn't just political posturing; it's a betrayal of national interest. The Congress must answer why it continues to speak Pakistan's language on Indian soil,"" Mr Patra said.

There's little doubt over the outcome of the ballot that will likely name a senior SpaceX representative as mayor of the new settlement. Most of the 283 eligible voters are SpaceX employees working at the site on Boca Chica Bay bordering Mexico, or have connections to the company whose billionaire chief has long eyed a human mission to Mars. Most ballots have already been cast ahead of the 7:00 pm (0100 GMT) deadline on Saturday. Musk himself is registered to vote, Cameron County Election Coordinator Remi Garza told AFP, but the South African-born embattled 53-year-old had yet to cast his ballot when the early voting period closed on April 29.  Nearly 500 people live around the base in Cameron County, on land mostly owned by SpaceX or its employees, official documents show. The change would allow Starbase to control building and permitting and avoid other regulatory hurdles, while collecting taxes and writing local law. The vote comes at a difficult time for Musk, who is expected to reduce his role as the unofficial head of US President Donald Trump's cost-cutting ""Department of Government Efficiency"" to instead focus more on his troubled car company, Tesla. The vote on Saturday includes a mayoral election, but Bobby Peden, vice president of testing and launch at SpaceX, according to LinkedIn, is the only candidate on the ballot for this position. The Texas base launched in 2019 and is a key testing site for the company's rocket launches. Not everyone is upbeat about the prospect of a SpaceX town. Bekah Hinojosa, co-founder of the South Texas Environmental Justice Network, voiced concerns over the environmental impact, warning of ""more environmental destruction."" ""They would attempt more illegal dumping, they would build up their dangerous rocket operations and cause more seismic activity, cause our homes to shake, and that they would destroy more of the wildlife habitat in the region,"" she told AFP. - Environmental concerns - It was Musk himself who proposed the name Starbase in a social media post during a visit to the site four years ago. Then, last December, general manager of SpaceX Kathryn Lueders appealed to local authorities to grant the site city status. Lueders argued in her letter that SpaceX already maintained infrastructure there like roads, education services and medical care. Lueders promised the creation of the new city would not undermine SpaceX efforts to mitigate the base's environmental impact. SpaceX did not respond to an AFP request for comment. The hub overlooks the Gulf of Mexico -- renamed the Gulf of America by Trump -- and there is controversy over access to Boca Chica Beach. A Texas House State Affairs committee rejected a bill this week by Republican lawmakers that would have given coastal cities with spaceports control over beach access. Hinojosa, the activist, said SpaceX has limited access to Boca Chica Beach for many years and told AFP she worried the vote could cut access entirely to a beach ""our families have been going to for generations."" The Carrizo/Comecrudo Nation of Texas, descendants of an Indigenous tribe in the area, has also complained. In 2024, the Environmental Protection Agency and Texas authorities found that SpaceX was responsible for repeated spills and releasing pollutants into Texas waterways. In response to reports that its rockets had caused damage to wild bird nests, Musk quipped on social media: ""To make up for this heinous crime, I will refrain from having omelette for a week.""

For 18 years, starting in 2001, California-based Tim Friede got himself knowingly bitten by some of the most venomous snakes on the planet in hopes of finding a cure for all snake bites. According to a report inCNN, antibodies found in Mr Friede's blood have now been shown to protect against fatal doses from a wide range of species in animal tests. Immunologist Jacob Glanville first heard about Mr Friede through media reports in 2017 and decided that there was an opportunity to do something groundbreaking. ""We had this conversation. And I said, I know it's awkward, but I'm really interested in looking at some of your blood,"" said Mr Glanville. ""And he [Tim Friede] said, 'Finally, I've been waiting for this call.'"" As the pair began working together, Mr Friede donated a 40-millilitre blood sample to Mr Glanville and his colleagues. Eight years later, Mr Glanville and Peter Kwong, Richard J. Stock, Professor of medical sciences at Columbia University's Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons havepublisheddetails of the antivenom that can protect against the bites from 19 species of poisonous snakes.  Currently, antivenom is made by injecting small doses of snake venom into animals, such as horses. Once the immune system fights the venom and produces the antibodies, scientists harvest them to be used as antivenom. However, venom and antivenom have to be closely matched. For example, antivenom made from snakes in India may not be as effective against the same species in Thailand. Also Read | Coldest Exoplanet Orbiting A Dead Star Found By Scientists While the antivenom cocktail prepared using MrFriede's blood has not been tested in humans yet, experts predict that the human origin of the antibodies would mean fewer side effects than antivenoms made the traditional way. ""Tim's antibodies are really quite extraordinary - he taught his immune system to get this very, very broad recognition,"" said Prof Kwong. Notably, Mr Friede gave up on injecting himself with snake venom in 2018 after some close calls. He is now employed by Glanville's biotechnology company Centivax and contributing to the research. As per the World Health Organization (WHO), every year, venomous snake bites kill tens of thousands of people globally and permanently disable several hundred thousand more.",2025-05-03 13:27:21,Positive

On Friday, the Ashoka Garden Police Station secured Farhan's remand for further investigation. The officers were escorting Farhan to verify the whereabouts of another suspect and collect other evidence in the case, a senior police officer said. ""When the team of Ashoka Garden police station was taking him to the location, Farhan requested that the vehicle be halted, stating he needed to relieve himself, said a senior police officer. ""Upon stopping near Sarwar village in the Ratibad police jurisdiction, the Sub-Inspector alighted with Farhan. However, Farhan attempted to seize the officer's service revolver. In the ensuing struggle, the firearm discharged, and the accused sustained a gunshot wound to his leg,"" said the officer. The incident occurred on Friday night. Farhan deliberately misled authorities by claiming that another fugitive in the case, Abrar, was hiding in Bilkisganj, a locality in Sehore district, the senior police officer said.  Acting on this information, five officers, including Sub-Inspector Vijay Bamne, accompanied Farhan in the police vehicle for further verification. According to the complaint filed, the accused individuals allegedly misled female students at a college in Bhopal by concealing their true identities.

Additionally, they coerced victims into involving other female students in similar situations. According to police, the victims have stated that they were repeatedly assaulted under the influence of intoxicants and were threatened with exposure if they refused to comply with the accused's demands.

It's a simple grilled sausage wrapped in a slice of white bread and topped with onions and ketchup, however, when the same is offered at polling places on election day, it becomes a 'democracy sausage' that has become a national symbol for participating in elections, and is served everywhere Australians vote.Not just in Australia, but these democracy sausages are also served at polling places for citizens abroad at Australian embassies in New York, Riyadh, Nairobi and Tokyo, and even at a research station in Antarctica. There is a website that also tracks in real-time crowd-sourced democracy sausage locations on polling day: ""It's practically part of the Australian Constitution."" The spokesperson of the website democracysausage.org, added, ""We've heard reports of people who are tourists over here, foreign students, that will go along to election days just to get the sausages. I think that's a great piece of Australian culture for people to take home with them.""  The sausage is also a way for aspiring leaders to show that they are humble enough to eat a cheap piece of meat wrapped in bread, and photographs of politicians eating these democracy sausages have become memes, and generally a part of Australian political folklore. The Australian National Dictionary Centre also named ""democracy sausage"" as its word of the year. Moreover, the Australian constitution does not mention anything about a dress code for voting, and it has become a tradition to vote in swimwear. This started when the maker of ""Budgie Smuggler"" was giving out free swimming trunks to the first 200 people who voted in smugglers. ""It's a little bit revealing and may be confronting for some of your viewers. But a lot people here come out of the water and come and vote. I think it's a nice statement of Australian democracy"", Nick Fabbri, a voter in the Bondi area of Sydney, told Reuters. Voting in Australia for the national election began on Saturday. Per polls, voter appetite for change has been dampened by US tariffs, and hence the elections might favour Labour Prime Minister Anthony Albanese over conservative challenger Peter Dutton.",2025-05-03 14:24:28,Positive

The faux Mount Fuji, dubbed the Universe Fantasy Land, is situated in the Hebei province of northern China, with visitors being charged Rs 1,138 (98 yuan) for each visit. According to a report inSouth China Morning Post, the tourist spot went viral on Chinese social media platforms after users posted videos and photos of the hill. The authorities responsible for the site sold it to prospective visitors as a fairy tale landscape, featuring a mountain, a lake, lush green grass, a white horse and a charming wooden cottage. The fantasy land was meant to be a getaway for urban dwellers from the capital city of Beijing who were eager to escape the mundane reality of life. One of the promotional videos of the location showed tourists nestled up in a nearby building as artificial pink smoke released from the hill -- designed as an ""eruption"" from the volcano hill. While many visitors were drawn by the clever promo material, they could not help but feel scammed as the mountain advertised turned out to be nothing more than a modest hilltop, painted white.  ""Just a small hill with white paint on its top. It has nothing to do with Mount Fuji,"" one visitor said, while another added: ""Just another instance of how modern individuals are misled by glamorous photographs."" A third commented: ""You do not need to pay to capture photos with the real Mount Fuji, yet here you have to pay for the fake one."" This is not the first instance when the Hebei province has gained headlines for its depiction of monuments and tourist attractions. Previously, the Eiffel Tower, the Great Sphinx of Giza, and even sections of the Great Wall have been replicated in the province, much to the amusement of the tourists.

On his YouTube channel ""Naa Anveshana"", Visakhapatnam-based Anvesh had posted a video in which he claimed DGP Jitender and the IAS officers accepted the amount to allow betting apps. He also accused the officials of misappropriating funds through the app, adding that the officials allowed promotion of the betting apps through advertisements on the Hyderabad Metro Rail. The other officials he named included Hyderabad Metro Rail Managing Director NVS Reddy, IAS officers Santhi Kumar, Dana Kishor and Vikas Raj. A First Information Report (FIR) against Anvesh was registered on a complaint by A Naveen Kumar, a constable working in the social media cell of Cyberabad Police Commissionerate. The police have called allegations baseless and have initiated legal action against him for disseminating unverified information.  Anvesh, who has 2.4 million subscribers on YouTube and 2 million followers on Instagram, had claimed that transactions worth Rs 1,000 crore occurred through betting apps, naming several Tollywood actors and social media influencers who were promoting and profiting from the business. Hyderabad Metro Rail Limited (HMRL) had last week removed advertisements related to betting apps from all metro premises after a Telangana High Court notice in response to a plea. The case comes months after cases were registered against actors Rana Daggubati, Vijay Devarakonda, Prakash Raj, Manchu Lakshmi, Nidhi Agarwal and 19 social media influencers for allegedly promoting betting apps.",2025-05-04 17:02:18,Positive

Iran-backed Houthi rebels have claimed responsibility for the attack, saying it demonstrated their ability to strike sensitive targets in Israel. The missile struck near Israel's biggest airport after multiple interception attempts by the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) failed, prompting a temporary halt in all takeoffs and landings at the country's main international airport. Around an hour after the strike, the Israel Airport Authority said the airspace was reopened and flight operations resumed. Local media said though a direct hit on terminal infrastructure was averted, the missile impacted a grove adjacent to an access road within the airport's perimeter. Following the strike, Israel's Defence Minister, Israel Katz, in a terse statement, said, ""Whoever harms us, we will strike them sevenfold.""  So far, Israel has refrained from launching retaliatory strikes on Yemen despite a series of Houthi attacks, as the United States leads a broader military campaign against the Iran-backed group. Meanwhile, Mohammed al-Bukhaiti, a senior official in Yemen's Houthi rebel movement, told the Qatari Al-Araby TV channel that the attack demonstrated their ability to strike sensitive targets in Israel and that the Iran-backed group has ""no red lines"" in its fight against Israel. Nasser al-Din Omar, media head for the Houthis, also reportedly warned the airlines against operations in Israel, saying it endangers the safety of their aircraft. Palestinian group Hamas also praised the 'precision' strike by Yemen's Huthis on the Israeli airport. Israel Probing Incident The Israeli Air Force's aerial defence units are now probing the reasons behind the unsuccessful interceptions of the missile fired by Houthis that breached Israel's air defence near one of the country's most sensitive zones. Magen David Adom (MDA), Israel's national emergency service, reported that eight people were injured in the attack. The Iran-backed Huthi rebels, who control swathes of Yemen, have launched missiles and drones targeting Israel and Red Sea shipping throughout the Gaza war, saying they are acting in solidarity with Palestinians. On Saturday, the Huthis claimed a third missile attack on Israel in two days. The vast majority of missiles fired by the Huthis since the start of the Gaza war in 2023 have been intercepted by Israeli air defences. The Yemeni rebels had paused their attacks during a recent two-month ceasefire in the Gaza war. But in March, they threatened to resume attacks on international shipping over Israel's aid blockade on the Gaza Strip. The move triggered a response from the US military, which began hammering the rebels with near-daily air strikes starting March 15 in a bid to keep them from threatening shipping in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden. US strikes on the rebels began under former president Joe Biden, but intensified under his successor Donald Trump. Since March, the United States says it has struck more than 1,000 targets in Yemen.",2025-05-04 17:02:19,Positive

https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/minimoons-rock-circling-near-earth-could-be-a-chunk-of-the-moon-8327113,'Minimoons': Rocks Circling Near Earth Could Be A Chunk Of The Moon,"May 04, 2025 15:23 pm IST","A whole population of 'minimoons' - tiny natural satellites - may be quietly circling near Earth, scientists now believe, after discovering a second Moon-origin rock drifting close to our planet. The newly observed object, named 2024 PT5, was spotted near Earth last August and is thought to be a lunar fragment, possibly blasted off the Moon during a massive impact long ago. This makes it only the second known piece of the Moon found orbiting in near-Earth space. ""If there were only one object, that would be interesting but an outlier,"" said Teddy Kareta, a planetary scientist at Lowell Observatory in Arizona. ""If there's two, we're pretty confident that's a population."" The findings were published inThe Astrophysical Journal Lettersin January and presented in March at the 56th Lunar and Planetary Sciences Conference in Texas. 2024 PT5 stood out when it was first observed by astronomers in South Africa, thanks to its unusually slow movement, just 2 metres per second relative to Earth. That made it a promising candidate for the Mission Accessible Near-Earth Object Survey (MANOS), which focuses on finding asteroids that are easiest to reach with spacecraft.  The rock, just 26 to 39 feet (8 to 12 metres) wide, didn't look like a typical asteroid. Mr Kareta and his team believe it may have been ejected from the Moon's surface during a violent impact. The discovery suggests that other such fragments might be hiding in near-Earth space. Earth regularly travels through a cloud of debris, both natural and man-made, as it orbits the Sun. Some of it is leftover rock from the early solar system, and scientists keep a close eye on these near-Earth objects (NEOs) in case any pose a threat. Material that gets blasted off the Moon during an impact usually stays close to Earth's orbit, especially the slower pieces. 2024 PT5 was briefly called a minimoon in September because it moved alongside Earth for a short time. But it didn't stay for long and eventually drifted away. Scientists think it will come close to Earth again in 2055. Within a week of the discovery, Mr Kareta and MANOS principal investigator Nick Moskovitz turned the Lowell Discovery Telescope toward 2024 PT5. After analysing the rock in visible and near-infrared light, they found its composition closely resembled moon rocks brought back by the Apollo missions and the Soviet Luna 24 mission. ""It's like realising a crime scene has a totally new kind of evidence you didn't know you had before,"" Mr Kareta toldSpace.com. ""It might not help you solve the crime right away, but considering the importance of the task, new details to compare are always welcome."" This is only the second known lunar fragment spotted in near-Earth space. The first, called Kamo'oalewa, was discovered in 2016 and linked to the Moon in 2021.",2025-05-04 17:02:27,Positive

The missile reportedly bypassed four layers of air defence and hit a grove adjacent to an access road within the airport's perimeter--one of the country's most sensitive zones-- creating a 25-meter deep crater. Israel Defence Forces (IDF) said their several attempts to intercept the missile failed before it landed near the airport, sending a plume of smoke into the air. However, a direct hit on terminal infrastructure was averted, yet it caused panic among passengers in the terminal building. At least eight people were injured in the attack, Magen David Adom (MDA), Israel's national emergency service, said.

This year, Google is also celebrating the day by throwing confetti around the search page when a user types the term ""Star Wars"" or ""May the fourth be with you"".

Fans dress up as their favourite characters and get together to celebrate the movie franchise.

Around an hour after the strike, the Israel Airport Authority said the airspace was reopened and flight operations resumed.

Magen David Adom (MDA), Israel's national emergency service, reported that eight people were injured in the attack. The Iran-backed Huthi rebels, who control swathes of Yemen, have launched missiles and drones targeting Israel and Red Sea shipping throughout the Gaza war, saying they are acting in solidarity with Palestinians. On Saturday, the Huthis claimed a third missile attack on Israel in two days. The vast majority of missiles fired by the Huthis since the start of the Gaza war in 2023 have been intercepted by Israeli air defences. The Yemeni rebels had paused their attacks during a recent two-month ceasefire in the Gaza war. But in March, they threatened to resume attacks on international shipping over Israel's aid blockade on the Gaza Strip. The move triggered a response from the US military, which began hammering the rebels with near-daily air strikes starting March 15 in a bid to keep them from threatening shipping in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden. US strikes on the rebels began under former president Joe Biden, but intensified under his successor Donald Trump.

The newly observed object, named 2024 PT5, was spotted near Earth last August and is thought to be a lunar fragment, possibly blasted off the Moon during a massive impact long ago. This makes it only the second known piece of the Moon found orbiting in near-Earth space. ""If there were only one object, that would be interesting but an outlier,"" said Teddy Kareta, a planetary scientist at Lowell Observatory in Arizona. ""If there's two, we're pretty confident that's a population."" The findings were published inThe Astrophysical Journal Lettersin January and presented in March at the 56th Lunar and Planetary Sciences Conference in Texas. 2024 PT5 stood out when it was first observed by astronomers in South Africa, thanks to its unusually slow movement, just 2 metres per second relative to Earth. That made it a promising candidate for the Mission Accessible Near-Earth Object Survey (MANOS), which focuses on finding asteroids that are easiest to reach with spacecraft.  The rock, just 26 to 39 feet (8 to 12 metres) wide, didn't look like a typical asteroid. Mr Kareta and his team believe it may have been ejected from the Moon's surface during a violent impact. The discovery suggests that other such fragments might be hiding in near-Earth space. Earth regularly travels through a cloud of debris, both natural and man-made, as it orbits the Sun. Some of it is leftover rock from the early solar system, and scientists keep a close eye on these near-Earth objects (NEOs) in case any pose a threat. Material that gets blasted off the Moon during an impact usually stays close to Earth's orbit, especially the slower pieces. 2024 PT5 was briefly called a minimoon in September because it moved alongside Earth for a short time. But it didn't stay for long and eventually drifted away. Scientists think it will come close to Earth again in 2055. Within a week of the discovery, Mr Kareta and MANOS principal investigator Nick Moskovitz turned the Lowell Discovery Telescope toward 2024 PT5. After analysing the rock in visible and near-infrared light, they found its composition closely resembled moon rocks brought back by the Apollo missions and the Soviet Luna 24 mission. ""It's like realising a crime scene has a totally new kind of evidence you didn't know you had before,"" Mr Kareta toldSpace.com. ""It might not help you solve the crime right away, but considering the importance of the task, new details to compare are always welcome."" This is only the second known lunar fragment spotted in near-Earth space. The first, called Kamo'oalewa, was discovered in 2016 and linked to the Moon in 2021.",2025-05-04 17:02:27,Positive

In a statement on Telegram, the Kremlin said that Xi will discuss with Russian President Vladimir Putin the development of the two countries' strategic partnership, as well as signing a number of documents. ""During the talks, the main issues of further development of relations of comprehensive partnership and strategic interaction, as well as current issues on the international and regional agenda will be discussed,"" the Kremlin said. The Soviet Union lost 27 million people in World War Two but pushed Nazi forces back to Berlin, where Hitler committed suicide and the red Soviet Victory Banner was raised over the Reichstag in 1945. Several other national leaders are expected at the celebrations, including the presidents of Brazil and Serbia, and the prime minister of Slovakia.  Putin has proposed a three day ceasefire with Ukraine around the May 9 celebration, one of the most important in the Russian calendar. Responding to Moscow's offer of the three-day ceasefire, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said he was ready as long as the ceasefire would be 30 days in length, something Putin had already ruled out in the near term, saying he wants a long-term settlement not a brief pause. Zelenskiy said Ukraine, given the continued war with Russia, could not guarantee the safety of any foreign dignitaries who came to Moscow for the traditional May 9 victory parade.

In his report, he suggested a slew of measures, including setting up an inquiry commission and outposts of central forces in districts bordering Bangladesh, besides writing, ""needless to add, the provisions under Article 356 of the Constitution also remain"". Asked about the mention of ""the provisions under Article 356 of the Constitution"" in the report, an official told PTI, ""The governor has not proposed for implementation of Article 356. He meant to say that the provisions of Article 356 of the Constitution are open to the Centre if the situation in the state further deteriorates."" The imposition of Article 356 of the Constitution refers to the President's rule in a state. The governor also expressed apprehension about a ""spillover"" of the Murshidabad violence to other districts of the state and recommended that the central government should consider ""constitutional options to put a check on the current situation besides generating confidence of people in the rule of law"".  ""The twin spectre of radicalisation and militancy poses a serious challenge for West Bengal, especially in two of the several districts sharing an international border with Bangladesh, viz., Murshidabad and Malda. In both these districts, there is an adverse demographic composition with Hindus being minorities. Another district, viz., Uttar Dinajpur, has a plurality,"" Mr Bose mentioned in his report, a copy of which is with PTI. The governor suggested several measures in the aftermath of violence that claimed the lives of at least three people, including a man and his son, and left several injured. The riot occurred amid anti-Waqf (Amendment) Act protests. ""Formulating an overarching legislation to empower the Union Government to maintain law and order when the state machinery fails to act effectively. Appointing a commission of Inquiry under the Commissions of Inquiry Act, 1952, to look into the reported acts of omission and commission as indicated above and to suggest measures to prevent such incidents in future and needless to add, the provisions under Article 356 of the Constitution also remain,"" the report mentioned. Of late, there are ""indications of radicalisation and polarisation"", it said. ""The divisions are so deep that even in the face of escalation of violence, the chief minister's repeated 'undertaking' that she would protect minority interests, and that the Act would not be implemented in the state, have done little to assuage the Muslim community or stem the tide. It is imperative that the rule of law must be firmly established, and the police must prevent violence,"" Mr Bose wrote in the report. The governor also said, ""To go by the history of political violence that the state is prone to and from the spillover effect that the Murshidabad violence had over other districts in the state, may I suggest that the Government of India considers the Constitutional options not only to put a check on the current situation but also to generate confidence of people in the rule of law."" In the report, the Bengal governor also claimed that the riots appeared ""premeditated"" and the state government was ""aware of the imminent build-up of a threat to law and order in Murshidabad"". ""As the Notification of the Waqf (Amendment) Act, 2025 was issued on 08.04.2025, conflagration unfolded in Murshidabad district that spiralled out of control and continued for several days. On 08.04.2025, the state government promulgated temporary suspension order of internet...Thus, the state government was aware of the imminent build-up of threat to law and order in Murshidabad,"" Mr Bose alleged in his report. It was expected that the state government also put in place a ""viable security mechanism on the ground that could prevent any occurrence and escalation of violence"", he said. ""Clearly, the sequence of events that unfolded shows the woeful lack of coordination among administration and law enforcement agencies that were either too feeble to rise up to the challenge or were reluctant to do so,"" Mr Bose alleged. The ruling TMC functionaries and the state government officials could not be reached for their comments on the governor's report.

Viyana Jain, daughter of IT professionals Piyush and Varsha Jain, was diagnosed with brain tumour last December. After surgery and treatment failed, the family turned to spiritual guidance. On March 21, during a visit to Jain monk Rajesh Muni Maharaj, the child was given theSantharavow with her parents' consent. Minutes later, she died. What IsSanthara? Santhara, also known asSallekhana, is a Jain religious practice in which an individual voluntarily chooses to end their life through fasting, according toA Sundara, head of the Department of Archaeology and Museums in Karnataka. The practice involves gradually abstaining from food and water, and is undertaken by Jains as a way to purify the soul and attain liberation. The vow cannot be taken at will. According to A Sundara's research, Jain scriptures clearly say thatSantharashould only be observed when death is near, or when a person is unable to follow religious duties due to old age, incurable illness, or extreme conditions like famine.  For example, if someone's worsening eyesight leads them to unknowingly harm living beings – violating the principle ofahimsa– they may chooseSanthara. The Practice OfSanthara An importantJain textfrom around the 4th century AD,Ratnakaranda Shravakacharaby Samantabhadra, gives a clear explanation of theSantharavow and how it should be followed. The text says that this vow should be taken to free the soul from the body, but only during extreme situations – like a natural disaster, old age, or an illness that cannot be cured. Anyone taking the vow must control their emotions, give up all their possessions, and mentally detach from loved ones. They should forgive everyone, ask for forgiveness, and feel sorry for their wrongdoings. Then, with a peaceful mind, they should focus on prayers and slowly stop eating and drinking and fast until death. IsSantharaLegal? WhileSantharais an accepted and revered practice in Jainism, it hasfaced legal challengesin India. In 2015, the Rajasthan High Court ruled thatSantharashould be considered illegal, equating it to suicide under Section 306 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). The court's reasoning was that the voluntary decision to end one's life was a form of self-harm and could not be justified as a religious practice. The ruling, however, was met with protests from the Jain community. A month later, theSupreme Court stayed the order, allowingSantharato continue under religious freedom protections.",2025-05-04 18:04:24,Negative

Henry targeted recently divorced women on dating platforms like Bumble, Tinder and presented himself as a charming and attentive individual who was ready to settle down. “Looking for a beautiful woman who understands the ups and downs of life, is trustworthy and no games,” read Henry's dating app bio. After meeting the woman for the first time, Henry escalated the relationship quickly and tied the knot within weeks. Post the wedding, Henry insisted on a joint bank account and revealed his true colours, often indulging in domestic violence. Tonya Betsey was one of the first victims of Henry, having met him on Tinder in 2020. They got married at the Duval County Courthouse in November of the same year. Despite being married, Henry later met Brandi Betsey on the dating app Stir and married her in Manatee County on February 22, 2022.  Not long after, Henry connected with Michele Betsey through Match.com and married her in Hernando County on November 23, 2022, while still married to Ms Tonya and Ms Brandi.

Now, the 'Omkara' actor has cleared the air around his remark saying that he had apologized for being evil in the film, and not for the film itself. Setting the record straight, she said, “I apologized to Tim for being the evil villain in the film. I was growling and smashing everyone in sight! He said next time you should play the hero. I stand by all my films, and this one too.”  Saif was in conversation with his 'Jewel Thief', co-star Jaideep Ahlawat during a segment on Netflix India's YouTube channel, where he shared that his son was not impressed by ""Adipurush"". Looking back at the experience, Saif revealed, “My son and I were watching the film recently, and I understood that it was bad. My son gave me a look as if to ask why he was being made to watch it, and I understood the situation. I quickly apologised to him.” Saif essayed the role of Lankesh, a character based on Ravana in the retelling of the epic tale of Ramayana. The project which also saw Prabhas and Kriti Sanon as the lead turned out to be a box office debacle with director Om Raut's directorial facing criticism for poor VFX, and mediocre dialogues. Recently, speaking with Ted Sarandos, Co-CEO of Netflix during WAVES Summit 2025, Saif opened up about the kind of content he likes to watch the most. He revealed, “I like historical films. Maybe films about other cultures, maybe Japanese. I am also very excited to see our culture on the big screens. The Mahabharata is the greatest story ever told, it's one of our great epics. I also like to watch massive war scenes, bringing life, history, and a past that is related to books. I would like to see that kind of atmosphere in movies. And I feel the long-form streaming format is just perfect for it.” (Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",2025-05-04 18:54:29,Positive

Rituals continued at the Sree Lairai Devi temple at Shirgaon in North Goa district with hundreds of devotees arriving on foot despite the temple committee appealing to people to stay away. A stampede broke out in the early hours of Saturday as thousands of devotees thronged the narrow lanes leading up to the temple. While six persons died, about 70 were injured. The fact-finding committee constituted by the Goa government is recording the statements of senior officials in charge of crowd management at the event.  The committee is headed by Sandeep Jacques, commissioner and secretary (revenue), with deputy inspector general Varsha Sharma, Director of Transport Pravimal Abhishek and Superintendent of Police Tikam Singh Verma are its members. Talking to PTI, a senior government official said the stampede broke out on a sloping ground which is prone to such accidents. ""We have learnt that a similar incident, on a minor scale, had happened at the same spot during last year's festival,"" he said. The committee will investigate why precautions were not taken this year, he added. ""The committee has recorded the statements of Collector Sneha Gitte, Superintendent of Police Akshat Kaushal, Deputy Superintendent of Police Jivba Dalvi, Deputy Collector Bhimnath Khorjuvekar, members of the temple committee and others,"" he said. The panel will need at least a couple of more days to gather inputs and file a report, the official said. It is also looking into reports that a fight between two groups of devotees triggered the stampede, he said. Despite the lanes leading to the temple being narrow, the temple committee had allowed shops to be set up on the route, adding to congestion, the official said. Director General of Police Alok Kumar had on Saturday said 30,000 to 40,000 people had gathered for the annual festival when some people standing on the slope fell, causing others to tumble and fall on each other. Goa Medical College and Hospital's medical superintendent Dr Rajesh Patil, meanwhile, said three out of the five persons who were seriously injured in the stampede were showing signs of improvement on Sunday. A total of 14 patients were admitted and only one has been discharged so far, he told PTI. Importantly, the condition of none of the critical patients has worsened, said Dr Patil. Goa Governor P S Sreedharan Pillai who visited the families of those who were killed in the stampede said the incident was ""beyond human expectation"". The government was doing its best to help the victims, he said. Notwithstanding the tragedy, hundreds of devotees visited the village on Sunday, walking at least two km to take part in a ritual where the goddess (her idol) 'visits' the houses of local residents. The ritual follows a day after the 'homkhand' rite during which devotees walk on the embers of a big fire lit in the temple grounds. Dinanath Gaonkar, president of the temple committee, said it was not possible to cancel the ritual. ""The incident on Saturday was unfortunate. Lives were lost. But we can not stop the rituals,"" he said. The temple committee had made an appeal to devotees to avoid visiting the village, he said. ""The police have also placed barricades in Assanora to stop vehicles from entering the area,"" he said. Yet, many were seen walking to the village on Sunday. Stalls set up in the lanes around the temple too remained open. A local resident said, ""You cannot stop people from attending the festival, as Devi Lairai is a revered deity with devotees across Goa, Maharashtra and Karnataka.""

The protest was called by Hefazat-e-Islam-- an influential Bangladeshi Islamist group-- claiming that some of the proposed recommendations hurt ""the sentiments of the majority of the people of this country"". Leaders of the Hefazat-e-Islam group claimed that draft recommendations of the Women's Affairs Reform Commission instituted by the Muhammad Yunus' interim government are contradictory to Sharia law. The group threatened a nationwide protest on May 23 if the government didn't meet their demands. Over 20,000 followers of the group rallied near the Dhaka University, some carrying banners and placards reading ""Say no to Western laws on our women, rise up Bangladesh"", in one of their biggest public shows of strength in years as religious activism surged in Bangladesh following the ouster of deposed prime minister Sheikh Hasina's Awami League regime last year. Protestors mostly included teachers and students of non-government or ""kawmi"" madrassas. Islamist groups in Bangladesh have increased their visibility since former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's ouster, and minority groups have complained of being intimidated.  The protestors mainly denounced proposed recommendations for ensuring equal rights, including ones related to property, for mainly Muslim women. Nayeb-e-Ameer or senior leader of the platform, Maulana Mahfuzul Huq, announced a 12-point charter of demands, with the first one being the abolition of the existing women reform commission and its members punished for the proposed changes, and constituting a new one comprising Islamic scholars and women representatives. He said the commission's proposed changes hurt ""the sentiments of the majority of the people of this country"" by labelling the religious laws of inheritance as the main cause of inequality between men and women. The group's leaders also demanded that the interim government led by Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad punus ban the Awami League party led by former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who was ousted in August. Hasina's opponents accuse her government of killing hundreds of students and others during the uprising that ended her 15-year rule. Hasina has been in exile in India since her ouster. ""Men and women can never be equal,"" a women's madrassa teacher, Mohammad Shihab Uddin, told the rally, adding that the Quran outlined specific codes of life for both genders and ""there is no way we can go beyond that"". The Hefazat called for reinstating ""complete faith and trust in almighty Allah"" in the constitution and asked the government to abandon the ""suicidal concept"" of pluralism and to protect what they said were the Muslims' faith and practices. The group also opposed the inclusion of terms such as ""gender identity,"" ""gender diversity,"" ""gender equality,"" ""gender discrimination,"" ""third gender,"" and ""other genders"". It argued that these are used to promote LGBT and transgender inclusion under ambiguous slogans such as ""Leave no one behind"" and ""inclusive"" and feared that these ideas could lead to a ""destructive, anti-religious pro-homosexual society"". The Women's Affairs Reform Commission is one of the several commissions instituted by the interim government to carry out reform. It had recently submitted its recommendations to the government.",2025-05-04 19:13:17,Positive

Claiming responsibility for the attack, Houthis said they acted in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza. In a video posted to his personal X account, Netanyahu said Israel's retaliation for the Houthi attack will not be a 'one-and-done' situation, and ""there will be blows"" in response to the attack. ""We are acting against them,"" the Israeli premier said, referring to previous Israeli Defence Force (IDF) operations against the Houthis in Yemen. צפו בעדכון חשוב ממני אליכם >>pic.twitter.com/hLLodqVnPz ""We have acted in the past, and we will act in the future. I cannot detail everything. The United States, in coordination with us, is also acting against them. It's not a one-and-done, but there will be blows,"" said Netanyahu. Israel's Defence Minister, Israel Katz, has also vowed a forceful response against the Iran-aligned Houthis. ""Whoever harms us, we'll harm them sevenfold,"" he said. A ballistic missile fired by Houthis landed just 75 meters from Terminal 3 of Ben Gurion Airport outside Tel Aviv. It reportedly bypassed four layers of air defence and hit a grove adjacent to an access road within the airport's perimeter--one of the country's most sensitive zones-- creating a 25-metre deep crater.  Israel Defence Forces (IDF) said their several attempts to intercept the missile failed before it landed near the airport, sending a plume of smoke into the air. However, a direct hit on terminal infrastructure was averted, yet it caused panic among passengers in the terminal building. Israel has a US-made THAAD system along with an indigenous Arrow system to intercept the missile, but both of them failed to stop the attack today. Authorities have launched a full-scale investigation into the breach of Israel's air defence and the missile's impact site. At least eight people were injured in the attack, Magen David Adom (MDA), Israel's national emergency service, said. Claiming responsibility, Houthi military spokesperson Yahya Saree said Israel's main airport was ""no longer safe for air travel"". Sunday's strike came as Israeli ministers were reported to be close to signing off on plans to expand the military operation in Gaza, which resumed in March following a two-month truce, prompting the Houthis to hit Israel with more missiles. Efforts to revive the ceasefire have faltered, and US President Donald Trump in March ordered large-scale strikes against the Houthis to reduce their capabilities and deter them from targeting commercial shipping in the Red Sea. The strikes have killed hundreds of people in Yemen. The Houthis, who control swathes of Yemen, began targeting Israel and Red Sea shipping in late 2023, during the early days of the war between Hamas and Israel in the Gaza Strip.",2025-05-04 19:53:08,Negative

The employment tribunal hearing the case declared that Joanne Neil, who worked for Dermalogica UK, should not have been made redundant in the manner the skincare firm did, as she was denied labour rights. The tribunal in Croydon, South London, found the sacking had ""significantly worsened"" Ms Neil's mental health, with which she had already been struggling, according to a report inThe Telegraph. She received the news of her sacking through a Microsoft Teams meeting where she wasn't given any opportunity to ask questions to the HR about the entire process. ""The short notice period she was given of the meeting and the misleading title of the invite 'catch up', meant she was unprepared and blindsided,"" said Judge Liz Ord. The meeting took place on Ms Neil's non-working day with her manager, Ian White and another executive on the call. She was told that she had ""unfortunately"" been selected to receive the sack. ""The announcement plunged her into a state of shock and despair, significantly setting back her state of mental health.""

Struggling to cope, Ms Neil often broke down in front of her colleagues but could not take an off as she was only entitled to two days' sick pay per year. The employment tribunal noted that Ms Neil's firing was indirect sex discrimination as she was selected for redundancy on the basis of her hours, which was a breach of the part-time workers' regulations since women were more likely to work part-time.

Following a vote at the Berkshire Hathaway board of directors over the weekend, Buffett will step down as chief executive of the world's 8th-largest company by market capitalization on January 1, 2026, and hand over the reins to the group's current vice-chairman, Greg Abel. The vote, which was proposed by Buffett, will bring to an end the revered investor's more than half-a-century running the group, which he turned into a financial behemoth. ""The time has arrived where Greg (Abel) should become the chief executive officer of the company at year end,"" Buffett, 94, told an annual shareholder meeting in Omaha, the city in the Midwestern state of Nebraska where Berkshire is based. Abel, 62, had been nominated to succeed Buffett in 2021. The Board of Directors voted unanimously on Sunday to appoint him to his new position, according to a statement from the group published Monday.  Berkshire Hathaway, a former small textile company, has grown over the years into a gigantic conglomerate under Buffett's leadership, and is now worth over $1 trillion on Wall Street -- a first for an American group outside the tech sector. Warren Buffett preferred to invest for the long term in stable companies whose accounts he had closely scrutinized, enabling him to build up the world's fifth-largest fortune over the decades. Today, his conglomerate owns dozens of businesses, from Duracell batteries to US insurer Geico, and shares in carefully selected companies, from Coca-Cola to Bank of America. Shortly before financial markets opened on Wall Street, Berkshire Hathaway's shares were down around 3.2 percent in pre-market.

The tribunal in Croydon, South London, found the sacking had ""significantly worsened"" Ms Neil's mental health, with which she had already been struggling, according to a report inThe Telegraph. She received the news of her sacking through a Microsoft Teams meeting where she wasn't given any opportunity to ask questions to the HR about the entire process. ""The short notice period she was given of the meeting and the misleading title of the invite 'catch up', meant she was unprepared and blindsided,"" said Judge Liz Ord. The meeting took place on Ms Neil's non-working day with her manager, Ian White and another executive on the call. She was told that she had ""unfortunately"" been selected to receive the sack. ""The announcement plunged her into a state of shock and despair, significantly setting back her state of mental health."" Also Read | Missing For 60 Years, Wisconsin Woman Found ""Alive and Well"" The court documents revealed that Ms Neill was identified for redundancy in November 2022. She had begun to struggle with her mental health in January 2022, but was not allowed to work her two days a week from home.  Struggling to cope, Ms Neil often broke down in front of her colleagues but could not take an off as she was only entitled to two days' sick pay per year. The employment tribunal noted that Ms Neil's firing was indirect sex discrimination as she was selected for redundancy on the basis of her hours, which was a breach of the part-time workers' regulations since women were more likely to work part-time. Notably, Ms Neill got to keep her job after another employee left the department.",2025-05-05 23:03:40,Negative

""This was my biggest fear my whole life, before captivity, during captivity. And it happened to me after captivity, in my safest place,"" she said, according to Israeli newspaperHaaretz. Ms Schem said she met the personal trainer, known for his celebrity clientele, at a Purim party. After attending three training sessions with him, she claimed he offered to connect her with a Hollywood producer interested in making a film about her ordeal in Gaza. When the first meeting fell through, she agreed to host a second meeting at her home. However, Ms Schem alleged that the trainer arrived late and persuaded her friend to leave, saying the meeting was sensitive. She said she remembers little of what happened afterwards, but believes she was drugged. ""My body remembers; it feels everything... but I don't know what happened,"" she said, adding that it took her days to process the physical and emotional trauma. Her mother, Keren, described her daughter's condition in the days after the alleged assault as worse than when she returned from captivity.

In its report titled ""Innovating out of the Middle-Income Trap,"" the Chintan Research Foundation has suggested that a linear approach need not be followed by a country like India that has a young, strong and skilled work force. A nation can advance by simultaneously investing in solid infrastructure, judiciously infusing foreign expertise (with caution), and nurturing local innovation ecosystems nations can craft a balanced development pathway, the report has suggested. The accepted model of advancement comes from last year's World Development Report from the World Bank. The report, titled ""The Middle-Income Trap"", suggests that middle income nations follow a linear sequence.  When a country is low-income, investment in infrastructure is required. Low-middle-income nations should begin ""infusion"" and only when it crosses the threshold of $14,000 per capita income, it can focus on ""innovating"" the received technology and exporting it globally. But India, the Chintan Research Foundation report said, is in a hurry to achieve developed country status - Viksit@47 - and ""does not have the luxury to follow the sequential approach to development"" as suggested in the World Development Report. Viksit Bharat is not a leap of faith but a calculated extension of measurable and maintainable trends. The report said the World Bank's cautionary stance on ""leapfrogging"" (jumping from investment to innovation without following infusion) negates the possibility of faster progress. It reinforces the traditional (view) 'others took 20 years to this path, so you should take the same amount of time too.'

The items are scheduled to be auctioned on Wednesday, with Sotheby's estimating the value at around HK$100 million (around Rs 107 crore). In a statement, the culture ministry said it has gathered information on the auction and issued a legal notice to Sotheby's. ""The Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) also requested the Consulate General of Hong Kong to take up the matter with authorities there demanding the immediate cessation of the auction,"" it said. In its statement, the Centre said the relics, which assume immense historical and spiritual significance, were excavated by William Claxton Peppe in 1898.  ""An inscription in Brahmi script on one of the caskets confirms these as relics of the Buddha, deposited by the Sakya clan,"" it said. A majority of these relics were transferred to the Indian Museum in Kolkata in 1899 and are classified as 'AA' antiquities under Indian law,  prohibiting their removal or sale, it added. While a portion of the bone relics was gifted to the King of Siam, a selection retained by Peppe's descendants has now been listed for auction, it said. The culture ministry said the Financial Investigation Unit (FIU) has been asked to coordinate with its counterpart in Hong Kong to highlight the illegality of the auction and ensure compliance with international laws.

But India, the Chintan Research Foundation report said, is in a hurry to achieve developed country status - Viksit@47 - and ""does not have the luxury to follow the sequential approach to development"" as suggested in the World Development Report. Viksit Bharat is not a leap of faith but a calculated extension of measurable and maintainable trends. The report said the World Bank's cautionary stance on ""leapfrogging"" (jumping from investment to innovation without following infusion) negates the possibility of faster progress. It reinforces the traditional (view) 'others took 20 years to this path, so you should take the same amount of time too.' The CRF said its research shows that scientific production is in progress, Indian researchers match or outpace many upper-middle-income peers and talent is flowing toward discovery rather than away from it.",2025-05-05 23:52:08,Positive

Nearly 1,800 jewels - pearls, rubies, sapphires, topaz, garnets, coral, amethysts, rock crystals, shells and gold - were discovered alongside bone fragments identified as belonging to the Buddha, from a stupa in Piprahwa, near his birthplace in Uttar Pradesh in 1898. The items are scheduled to be auctioned on Wednesday, with Sotheby's estimating the value at around HK$100 million (around Rs 107 crore). In a statement, the culture ministry said it has gathered information on the auction and issued a legal notice to Sotheby's. ""The Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) also requested the Consulate General of Hong Kong to take up the matter with authorities there demanding the immediate cessation of the auction,"" it said. In its statement, the Centre said the relics, which assume immense historical and spiritual significance, were excavated by William Claxton Peppe in 1898.  ""An inscription in Brahmi script on one of the caskets confirms these as relics of the Buddha, deposited by the Sakya clan,"" it said. A majority of these relics were transferred to the Indian Museum in Kolkata in 1899 and are classified as 'AA' antiquities under Indian law,  prohibiting their removal or sale, it added. While a portion of the bone relics was gifted to the King of Siam, a selection retained by Peppe's descendants has now been listed for auction, it said. The culture ministry said the Financial Investigation Unit (FIU) has been asked to coordinate with its counterpart in Hong Kong to highlight the illegality of the auction and ensure compliance with international laws. ""The Ministry of Culture remains steadfast in its efforts to protect India's cultural heritage and ensure the repatriation of the Piprahwa Relics. We call upon Sotheby's Hong Kong to immediately withdraw the relics from auction and cooperate with Indian authorities to return these sacred artifacts to their rightful place,"" the statement said. Sotheby's Response To India's Notice The ministry, in its statement, said that Ivy Wong, Associate General Counsel, Sotheby's, responded to the notice and assured ""full attention"" in the matter. Earlier, Nicolas Chow, chairman of Sotheby's Asia, called the relics ""among the most extraordinary archaeological discoveries of all time"". The auction house described the offering as being ""of unparalleled religious, archaeological and historical importance"", as perThe Guardian. Chris Peppe, great-grandson of William Claxton Peppe and one of the current owners, defended the decision to sell the relics. He said the family explored donating the items to temples and museums, but ran into obstacles. The auction was ""the fairest and most transparent way to transfer these relics to Buddhists,"" he told the BBC.",2025-05-05 23:52:11,Positive

Just hours before the closed consultations, Guterres voiced concern over tensions between India and Pakistan being at ""their highest in years"", saying ""it pains me to see relations reaching a boiling point"". Guterres made remarks to the press from the UNSC stake-out Monday morning amid rising tensions between the two nuclear-armed neighbours following the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack in Jammu and Kashmir that killed 26 civilians, including a Nepali citizen.  Guterres said he understands the ""raw feelings"" following the ""awful terror attack"" in Pahalgam and reiterated his strong condemnation of that attack, extending his condolences to the families of the victims. ""Targeting civilians is unacceptable – and those responsible must be brought to justice through credible and lawful means,"" he said. Guterres stressed that it is essential – especially at this critical hour—to avoid a military confrontation that could easily spin out of control. ""Now is the time for maximum restraint and stepping back from the brink. That has been my message in my ongoing outreach with both countries. Make no mistake: A military solution is no solution,"" the UN chief said. He reiterated that he offers his good offices to both governments in the service of peace. ""The United Nations stands ready to support any initiative that promotes de-escalation, diplomacy, and a renewed commitment to peace."" Apart from the five veto-wielding permanent members—China, France, Russia, UK and the US—the 10 non-permanent members in the Council are Algeria, Denmark, Greece, Guyana, Pakistan, Panama, South Korea, Sierra Leone, Slovenia and Somalia. India's former Permanent Representative to the UN Ambassador Syed Akbaruddin told PTI that no ""consequential outcome"" can be expected from ""a discussion where a party to the conflict seeks to shape perceptions by using its membership of the Council. India will parry such Pakistani efforts"". (Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",2025-05-06 01:25:15,Positive

https://www.ndtvprofit.com/markets/silver-nears-55-surpasses-october-highs-mcx-rate-crosses-rs-166-lakh,,,"US spot silver price rose 2.5% to near $55 an ounce on Friday, thereby surpassing the record high it clocked in October. The precious metal reached an intraday high of $54.75 per ounce so far. At 19:47 hours (IST), it was trading at $54.57, up 2.2% from the previous day's close. Reflecting the rise in global prices, the rates jumped on India's Multi Commodity Exchange (MCX) as well, where silver futures were trading 2.5% higher at Rs 1.66 lakh per kilogram. This was close to the all-time high of Rs 1.7 lakh a kg recorded on the MCX last month. In the US spot market, silver rose to an all-time high of $54.48 per ounce on Oct. 17. Since then, the prices began easing significantly, and the metal remained range-bound between $40-50 an ounce over the past month. Notably, silver crossed the $40-mark on Oct. 9, as the metal's price rose sharply due to an unprecedented squeeze in physical silver supply. In India, the price also surged during the month due to massive festive season demand. Silver exchange-traded-funds traded at hot-air premiums in October, rising by 5-10% each, as the precious metal's demand soared amid a global shortage. This had led to several mutual funds halting fresh inflows into their silver fund-of-funds, citing the sharp shortage in physical silver supply. However, the frenzy around silver ETFs cooled in the third week of October, after global prices softened and the London Bullion Market Association projected an ease in the supply situation. The fresh jump in silver prices comes amid increasing odds of a rate cut by the US Federal Reserve in December. Silver, similar to gold, gains strength in a low-interest environment. Both the metals are seen as hedge against inflation. Gold prices remained upbeat on Friday, rising nearly 1% to $4,197.01 an ounce in the US spot market. On India's MCX, the yellow metal was trading 0.76% higher at Rs 1,26,453 per 10 gram at 20:28 hours (IST).",2025-11-28 20:31:17,Positive

The famous fast food chain aims to scale up its global sales to $1.32 billion or 1 billion pounds, news agencyReutersreported. In the backdrop of a growing middle class and a rise in protein consumption in the country, CEO of German Doner Kebab Simon Wallis toldReutersthat he finds India to be a ""ripe"" market for their product. Therefore, he said that he views the country as an integral part of the chain's growth plan. Wallis cited India's ""thriving economy"" as one of the reasons why a number of brands are attracted to the Indian market. An array of global brands like Little Caesars and Papa John's International (PZZA.O) are scaling up in India, despite sales slowing down for Yum Brands' KFC and Pizza Hut amid consumer cutbacks. The GDK CEO said that he sees this as an opportunity for ""newer and more disruptive brands to emerge"" in the land. The fast-food chain is anticipating an early 2026 entry in India after launching a nationwide expansion under a master franchise deal with Middle East-based bakery product supplier GBC India. The famous kebab chain will tailor make its menu for India and skip on beef options just like McDonald's and Burger King, who had opted for lamb items to adhere to local preferences. Clarifying the company’s stance on going public, Wallis contradicted predecessor Imran Sayeed’s views and said that their only focus right now is to achieve the 1 billion pound sales milestone. In 2022, Sayeed had implied plans to list on the New York Stock Exchange within three to five years.

The intense 144-hour search for Salman ended in a dramatic arrest in Bhopal, followed by a shocking escape attempt that ended with police opening fire. According to police sources, Salman had trekked into Bhopal through the forest, dodging checkpoints, and had been hiding in the Gandhi Nagar locality. He had no mobile phone, no documents, and was in an inebriated state when caught. As soon as news broke of his detention, workers of the Jai Maa Bhavani Hindu organization rushed to the Gandhi Nagar police station but by then, Salman had already been taken away by Gauharganj police, who had taken him into custody, and left immediately. After the arrest, tension flared in the city. On Friday morning, leaders of the Hindu Utsav Samiti and Sanskriti Bachao Manch reached Hamidia Hospital, raising slogans and demanding harsh action.  Committee president Chandrashekhar Tiwari, accusing the administration of a ""weak information system"" that allowed the accused to hide in Bhopal for days, said ""the accused should be shot dead."" The real twist came from Naya Basti, where two young men - Abdul Rizwan and Asif - played the most crucial role in arresting the fugitive. Speaking exclusively to NDTV, Abdul Rizwan recounted the tense moment. ""I recognized him from a photo on social media. He was roaming around Sector-11 asking for a house to rent. Our boys noticed he had no ID, no registration. He looked exactly like the Raisen accused. He was drunk. We kept him detained from 10 pm to 11:15 pm until the Gauharganj police arrived."" Rizwan said the accused kept trying to escape, but the group kept him engaged until the police reached. ""He asked for a room to rent, but when we asked for an ID card, he said he had nothing. He claimed he slept on the footpath. We detained him. He kept trying to leave, so we stopped him on the pretext of offering him tea. Then the Crime Branch team arrived and took him away."" The youths say Salman told them he had no family support, his mother had died and he lived alone in Karond.

Hours after Venugopal alleged that the Left government in Kerala was working according to the wishes of the BJP government at the Centre, Sivankutty hit back at the Congress leader, accusing him of giving ""wrong advice"" to Rahul Gandhi, the Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha. Speaking to reporters in New Delhi, Venugopal alleged that the Left government had tried to implement the Labour Code of the central government despite pro-Left trade unions, including CITU and AITUC, expressing concern over it. He also cited the recent signing of the PM SHRI project by the Left government and said such steps were extremely condemnable.  Facing strong resistance from its major coalition partner, the CPI, the CPI(M)-led government last month decided to put on hold the implementation of the Centre's PM SHRI scheme in the state, days after a memorandum of understanding (MoU) was signed in this regard in New Delhi. Responding to the allegations, Sivankutty told media in Thiruvananthapuram that Venugopal is ""the great leader who deliberately gave up"" his Rajya Sabha candidature in order to ensure a majority for the BJP in the Upper House. ""By giving Rahul Gandhi wrong advice, he is implementing a strategy that weakens the Congress in every state where elections are held. Instead of strengthening the party, he is trying to destroy it,"" alleged Sivankutty, who holds both the Labour and Education portfolios in the Pinarayi Vijayan-led government. ""Even when central investigative agencies have targeted Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi, one must think about why only K C Venugopal -- the organisational general secretary who leads the Congress -- remains completely safe. This is proof that there is an active internal nexus between him and the BJP,"" the CPI(M) leader alleged. He also claimed that Venugopal's next goal is to prepare the ground for the BJP in Kerala. ""Every Congress worker and leader must recognise this move, through which he is digging a pit for his own party,"" Sivankutty alleged, referring to Venugopal's frequent interventions in Kerala politics. The Left government in Kerala had recently found itself in a difficult position after a draft regulation linked to the Centre's Labour Codes--introduced three years ago--came to light. The Left parties have been strongly opposing these labour codes at the national level, calling them ""anti-worker"". The draft regulation, however, had already been notified in the state on December 14, 2021. Following media reports, Sivankutty was forced to issue a clarification on Thursday, saying that the Centre's Labour Codes would not be implemented in the state.

The victim, Debobrata Mondal, alias Babu Mondal, a member of the Sampuipara-Basukathi gram panchayat, was returning home around 11 pm on a motorcycle with his associate Anupam Rana when the attack took place near the Nishchinda-Buro Shibtala area under Liluah police station limits, a senior police officer said on Friday. According to police, two motorcycle-borne assailants approached them and fired several rounds at close range. Mondal was hit in the waist and shoulder and collapsed on the spot, while Anupam sustained bullet injuries when he tried to resist the attackers. Local residents rushed both men to Belur State General Hospital. Mondal was later shifted to SSKM Hospital in Kolkata, where he succumbed to his injuries, hospital sources said. Anupam, who was taken to a private hospital in North Howrah, remains in critical condition. Howrah Police Commissioner Praveen Tripathy visited the spot with a team soon after the incident. ""A case of murder has been registered. We are examining CCTV camera footage, and efforts are being made to trace the accused,"" he said. Senior Trinamool Congress leaders, including Howrah District (Sadar) president and MLA Goutam Chowdhury, MLA Kalyan Ghosh, and Domjur Youth Trinamool leader Noorj Molla, visited the hospitals where the victims were taken.  MLA Ghosh said the motive behind the attack was still unclear and demanded the immediate arrest of those involved. Police sources said at least five rounds were fired during the assault.

The killing has heightened tensions in the area ahead of the 2026 Assembly elections, with some local TMC workers alleging the involvement of a man known as Basu, though police said all angles were being investigated.

From interesting travel tales to fond movie memories and thoughtful insights, the veteran actress is an open book when it comes to her social media posts. Last year, she shared the story of how the late actor-filmmaker Raj Kapoor cast her as Rupa in the hit 1978 musical romanceSatyam Shivam Sundaram. Zeenat Aman describedSatyam Shivam Sundaramas ""a defining anecdote"" from her career. She wrote, “In December, we will mark the 100th birth anniversary of the extraordinary Raj Kapoor. I have rehashed the story of how he came to cast me as Rupa in Satyam Shivam Sundaram countless times, but here it is for Instagram. A defining anecdote from my career.” A post shared by Zeenat Aman (@thezeenataman) Zeenat Aman retraced her steps back to the 1982Raj Kapoor-led dramaVakil Babu. She said, “It was 1981, and we were shootingVakil Babu. Rajji (Raj Kapoor) was playing the titular role, while his younger brother Shashi Kapoor and I were playing leading roles as each other's love interests. In between takes, while the technicians changed sets and rigged lights, we cast members often found ourselves with time to kill. Now Rajji had a radical approach to his art, and he was brimming with enthusiasm for a film he wanted to make. For days he regaled us with his idea for a story about a man who falls in love with a woman's voice but can't quite reconcile himself to her appearance.”  Zeenat Aman added that Raj Kapoor “never once hinted” that she could be a part of the project. “He spoke with unfettered and rousing passion, but never once even hinted that I could be a part of this film. I was already a star in my own right, and his lack of interest in casting me began to chafe. I knew that my ‘modern image', complete with mini skirts and boots, was the culprit. So I determined to take matters into my own hands,” she said. Revealing how she presented herself as Rupa in front of Raj Kapoor, Zeenat Aman continued, “I knew that Rajji spent much of his spare time at ‘The Cottage' set on the grounds of his sprawling R.K. Studio. It was here that he would hold meetings or host small events, often presiding over these gathering from a pristine mattress placed on the floor. So I made my move. One evening, having wrapped up early from the shoot, I spent an extra 30 minutes in my dressing room making myself up in my own interpretation of Rupa. I put on a ghagra choli, braided my hair with a parandi, and then stuck tissue paper onto my face with glue in an effort to scar my visage.” “When I reached The Cottage I was greeted at the door by John, Rajji's right-hand man. He looked quizzically at me but followed my request - ‘Saabji ko kaho ki Rupa ayi hai',” signed off Zeenat Aman, before adding that she would be continuing the story the next day.

https://www.ndtvprofit.com/world/hong-kong-blaze-death-toll-climbs-to-128-arrests-widen,,,"Hong Kong’s deadliest fire in nearly eight decades has killed at least 128, officials announced shortly after making fresh arrests in connection with the blaze. Secretary for Security Chris Tang said at a Friday briefing that officials couldn’t rule out finding more bodies. The status of roughly 200 residents remains uncertain, including 89 of the deceased whose identities haven’t been confirmed. Tang also detailed how construction materials erected for renovation work at the estate contributed to the rapid spread of the fire. The blaze began Wednesday on the lower floors of a building in Wang Fuk Court, where netting wrapped around bamboo scaffolding caught fire and ignited highly flammable foam boards installed around windows. The intense heat also set the scaffolding ablaze, causing burning bamboo pieces to fall and ignite additional floors across the eight-tower complex in northern Hong Kong. Director of Fire Services Andy Yeung said problems had been found with the fire alarms in the buildings, which produced no sound. The blaze is the deadliest in Hong Kong since a warehouse fire in 1948 that killed 176 people. The Independent Commission Against Corruption said Friday it had arrested eight people linked to the estate’s renovation: two directors and two project managers of the engineering consultancy responsible for the work, three scaffolding subcontractors - including a married couple that owns the business - and a middleman. Two directors and a consultant from the contractor responsible for the renovation were arrested earlier on suspicion of manslaughter. Inspections had flagged risks well before the disaster. Regulators conducted 16 checks on the renovation project and issued repeated written warnings urging the contractor to put proper fire-prevention measures in place — including as recently as last week, according to the Labour Department. The company handling the HK$315.5 million ($40.6 million) renovation is also working on 11 other residential projects across Hong Kong, officials said. “It’s premature to pass judgment on any officials or even on any companies involved, but I think government should take a good look at our existing legislation,” Hong Kong lawmaker Regina Ip said in a Bloomberg TV interview Friday. That includes identifying any gaps in requirements for fire-retardant materials, whether for major works or small-scale renovations, and stepping up enforcement, she said. Hong Kong Chief Executive John Lee visited the disaster site on Thursday. He earlier ordered a city-wide inspection of all housing estates undergoing major renovations. At a snap briefing, he said each affected family would receive HK$10,000 in relief. Flanked by several officials, he also pledged to completely phase out bamboo scaffolding in favor of metal alternatives. The government announced on Friday that each affected household will receive an additional HK$50,000 in living allowance. The unprecedented high-rise blaze comes at a delicate moment for Hong Kong. The global finance hub has been working to rebuild its international image after mass protests, a national-security crackdown and strict Covid controls drew criticism from some Western governments. Officials are days away from legislative elections — and Lee would be weighing whether to postpone them. Across the city, several events have been canceled. Oxfam Hong Kong called off its popular Trailwalker fundraising race, while Disneyland scrapped a special screening and premiere of Zootopia 2. Other cancellations include the Standard Chartered Arts in the Park festival and a 10-kilometer race organized by Hong Kong Marathon Pro and the Pegasus Athletics Club. While the broader economic impact should be limited, the tragedy points to deeper political problems, according to Gary Ng, senior economist at Natixis. “A series of mistakes by various stakeholders ultimately led to the tragedy,” Ng said, adding that with so many aging buildings across Hong Kong, these issues must be addressed to prevent further economic, social and human losses. The death toll has exceeded that of the Grenfell Tower fire in London, which killed 72 people in June 2017. That blaze was later deemed to be the result of a “catalogue of failures” by the government and construction industry. While that tragedy unfolded in the middle of the night as residents slept, this fire began mid-afternoon when many people would have been awake. Renovation works at Wang Fuk Court were carried out by Prestige Construction & Engineering Co. Bloomberg News visited Prestige’s office on Thursday, but the shutters were down and no one responded despite repeated knocking. Phone calls to the office went unanswered. Residents displaced by the fire will be sheltered in temporary accommodation. About 1,800 units of transitional housing will be made available — roughly equivalent to the estate’s entire housing stock. Volunteers have rushed to the site and corporate donations have poured in, including from the Jockey Club, which pledged up to HK$170 million to support those affected. Deadly fires have prompted major housing policy overhauls in Hong Kong in the past. Most notably, the Shek Kip Mei fire in 1953, which displaced tens of thousands of refugees, led to the start of the city’s public housing program, with the government providing resettlement housing for the residents.",2025-11-28 20:31:41,Positive

The fitness coach highlighted early in the conversation how important it is to eat something that gives you ""instant energy"" before working out. “My go-to is a banana and a couple of nuts or a date and a couple of nuts,” she said, while talking about pre-workout meal. These simple, all-natural options offer quick carbs and healthy fats, making them ideal for powering short or intense workouts. She added that this combination remains her ""most favourite pre-workout snack,"" noting its easy digestion — a key factor when eating right before exercising. Yasmin Karachiwala also made it clear that protein should be the main focus of a post-workout meal. “Post-workout, anything with protein,” she said. Protein is essential for rebuilding muscle fibres and supporting overall recovery after physical activity. For non-vegetarians, the fitness trainer suggested eggs as a great option. However, she also recommended a protein shake as a quick and efficient alternative for people who are constantly on the move.  A post shared by The Masoom Minawala Show (@themasoomminawalashow) Yasmin Karachiwala further pointed out that the nutrition industry in India is evolving, with many new protein choices entering the market. “Right now, we have some great protein shakes in the market… which are plant-based, which aren't whey,” she explained. As more people report whey intolerance, the demand for dairy-free options continues to rise. According to Yasmin, Indian brands are now offering ""great protein substitutes"" to meet this growing need. These plant-based options serve as a reliable alternative for those who follow vegan or vegetarian diets or have allergies. Yasmin Karachiwala's recommendations reflect a wider shift toward simple, clean and easy-to-digest nutrition that supports fitness goals effectively.

The World Cup-winning captain will be in Hyderabad after the Kolkata leg -- the first of his tour. He will then proceed to Mumbai and New Delhi where he is expected to meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi. ""Thanks for all the love from India! The GOAT tour kicks off in a few weeks' time!!! I'm happy to share that Hyderabad has been added to my visits to Kolkata, Mumbai and Delhi. See you soon India!"" Messi posted on his social media handle. A post shared by Leo Messi (@leomessi) The decision to add Hyderabad came in the wake of the cancellation of Argentina's proposed friendly in Kochi, which had been originally announced by Kerala Sports Minister V Abdurahiman for November 17. The revised plan ensured that Messi's 'GOAT Tour' would span all the four corners of India -- east (Kolkata), south (Hyderabad), west (Mumbai) and north (New Delhi). Satadru Dutta, the sole organiser of the 'GOAT Tour to India 2025', had told PTI that Messi's event in Hyderabad will be held either at Gachibowli or Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium.

The GOAT Tour, conceptualised by Dutta, will feature a mix of celebrity football matches, musical events, meet-and-greet sessions, masterclasses for children and felicitation ceremonies across four cities. Messi will start his tour in Kolkata on December 13, followed by Hyderabad the same evening, before travelling to Mumbai on December 14 and concluding in New Delhi on December 15.

The police have detained three juveniles in connection with the murder and launched further investigation. According to the police, they received information on Thursday from a hospital in Rohini about the teenager, who was brought with stab injuries and was declared dead. A police team reached the hospital and later inspected the crime scene. ""During the inquiry, the team recorded the statement of the cousin of the teen, who is also a juvenile. He claimed to be an eyewitness to the incident. He told the police that he rushed to the spot along with his friend Armaan (18) after receiving a call about a quarrel involving others,"" a police officer said. The officer further said that the teen and others were involved in a heated argument with three boys -- all 15 years old. During the fight, one of the juveniles allegedly stabbed him in the abdomen and thigh, the officer said, adding that the accused fled the spot soon after. ""We checked CCTV footage and gathered local intelligence. Two of the juveniles were detained. The teen was a class 11 student at a private school in Karala. His father works with the NDPL, while his mother is a homemaker. We are questioning the juveniles to know the exact reason behind the murder,"" added the officer.

https://sports.ndtv.com/formula-1/lando-norris-staying-calm-with-formula-1-title-in-his-sights-at-qatar-gp-9717041,Lando Norris Staying Calm With Formula 1 Title In His Sights At Qatar GP,Associated Press,"Lando Norris has a big enough lead not to panic heading into the penultimate race of the Formula 1 season in Qatar on Sunday. The McLaren driver is close to sealing the first F1 title of his career. The 26-year-old Briton is 24 points ahead of teammate Oscar Piastri and Red Bull's Max Verstappen, whose brilliant comeback in recent weeks has given him a glimpse of a fifth straight crown. Verstappen's 69 race wins put him third all-time behind Michael Schumacher (91) and Lewis Hamilton (105). The dynamic Dutchman is already considered one of the best F1 drivers ever and his late charge this season was aided by the disqualification of both McLaren drivers following the Las Vegas GP last Sunday, a race he won. Norris lost the 18 points he had earned from crossing the line in second place, and Piastri the 12 from initially placing fourth. ""Of course it hurts. But actually I found it quite easy just to move on,"" said Norris, who earlier this season found himself lagging behind a dominant Piastri. ""I feel as relaxed as I was before, when I was 35 points behind (Piastri), and I feel the same when I'm 24 points ahead. That's my strength for now."" There are 33 points on offer this weekend, with an additional eight from Saturday's sprint race. Put more simply: Norris will clinch the Formula 1 title if he scores at least two more points than Verstappen and Piastri across the weekend. Race strategy will be harder to impose given that teams have two mandatory pit stops in Qatar, a measure imposed on safety grounds due to high risk of tire degradation at the 5.4-kilometer (3.35-mile) Lusail International Circuit. Pirelli tires are restricted to a maximum 25 laps in the 57-lap race. McLaren's penalty in Vegas hurt Norris, who had won the two previous races, more than Piastri. He inadvertently closed the gap on Norris, having finished six points behind him in that race before the DQ. But Piastri has not won since the final day of August at the Dutch Grand Prix and has no podiums in the past six races. ""There's still a chance,"" the Australian driver said. ""I also know that it's a bit of an outside shot."" Verstappen has won the last two races in Qatar and four of the last five in Abu Dhabi, where the season will end the following Sunday. His chances are boosted by a sprint race in Qatar, even if it's a mini-format he generally does not like. ""Ready. See what happens,"" he said. ""Yes, it is closer (than expected). Ideally I would have loved to have had it even more close. All in, and hopefully we can make it exciting to the end."" The race weekend began with a practice session in the afternoon followed by sprint qualifying in the early evening. After the Las Vegas race, the FIA summoned McLaren to race stewards for failing inspection. They deemed that the measured thickness on the skid wear - the wear on the protective plank on the underside of the cars - failed to meet the minimum requirements on both cars. Norris went from 30 points up on Piastri and 42 up on Verstappen to 24 up on both rivals (390-366). Piastri holds the tie-breaker for second in the standings based on his win total compared to Verstappen (7-6). Ferrari needs a strong finish to the season after being on the receiving end of criticism from executive chairman John Elkann. Hamilton has struggled this season and the seven-time F1 champion's performances have been below expectations. ""I feel terrible. Terrible,"" Hamilton said after Las Vegas, where he recorded his worst-ever qualifying performance by finishing 20th. ""No matter how much I try, it just keeps getting worse,"" he said. Aside from clinching a sprint race in China in March, the 40-year-old Briton has not won for Ferrari. Overall, he has won only two F1 races in four seasons including this one. His frustration has at times been expressed in curt message exchanges over the team radio with Ferrari race engineer Ricciardo Adami, with Hamilton sarcastically telling him to ""have a tea break while you're at it"" during the Miami GP in May. Hamilton was urged by team principal Frédéric Vasseur to ""calm down and be focused on the next two races"" and the driver has since said that his post-race comments in Vegas were made ""in the heat of frustration."" Charles Leclerc has not won a race this season, either, having won three with Ferrari in 2024. But the driver from Monaco leads Hamilton 7-0 in podiums and comfortably in the standings. Leclerc is fifth with 226 points, while his teammate is sixth with 152, only 15 points ahead of Kimi Antonelli, his 19-year-old replacement at Mercedes.

""The confluence of stable inflation, sustained public capex, and reform momentum positions the economy to navigate risks, as reflected in upward revisions to FY26 GDP growth projections by various agencies,"" the CEA told reporters at a press conference in New Delhi. The July-September period GDP growth rate came in at 8.2%, the fastest expansion in six quarter and far higher than forecasts. ""We were concerned in August on negative impact of US tariffs. We are now talking about 7% growth rate or higher,"" the CEA said. The US tariff of 50% on most Indian goods came into force in August and caused a decline in exports in the subsequent months. However, GDP data released on Friday showed manufacturing and services activity expanded sharply compared to last year due to higher private consumption and investment. A government statement said improving price dynamics and tax reforms are expected to boost household disposable incomes, strengthening the near-term consumption outlook. Moreover, healthy corporate sector balance sheets augur well for sustained private investments in the remaining half of FY26. The CEA also said the government's First Advance Estimates will use the existing base while the Second Advance Estimates will shift to the new base series. The Q1 and Q2 data will be also revised under the new GDP base.",2025-11-28 20:31:56,Negative
