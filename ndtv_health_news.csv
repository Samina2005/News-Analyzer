https://doctor.ndtv.com/living-healthy/is-kombucha-beneficial-for-your-gut-health-8313711,Is Kombucha Beneficial For Your Gut Health?,"Updated: May 2, 2025 07:13 IST","Kombucha, a fizzy fermented tea, has emerged as a popular health beverage across the globe. Touted as a natural probiotic, kombucha is often linked to improved digestion, better gut health, and even immune support. Made by fermenting sweetened tea with a symbiotic culture of bacteria and yeast (SCOBY), this ancient drink has been consumed for centuries. But does it really deliver on its health promises, especially for the gut? According to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and other studies, kombucha may play a supportive role in gut microbiome diversity. Let's explore the science behind this fermented favourite. Kombucha contains natural probiotics and bioactive compounds that may help balance gut bacteria and enhance digestion. During fermentation, beneficial bacteria and organic acids are produced, which can aid the gut microbiome. According to a review published in Frontiers in Microbiology, fermented foods like kombucha can positively influence gut flora, which is essential for nutrient absorption, immune function, and overall digestive well-being. With packed itineraries and limited access to clean facilities, hygiene can often take a back seat. Here are 7 essential hygiene tips to help you stay healthy and safe while travelling. Let's explore why eating a few tulsi leaves every day could be a powerful step toward holistic well-being. The fermentation process produces several strains of live beneficial bacteria, such as Lactobacillus and Acetobacter. These probiotics may help restore the balance of gut flora, especially after antibiotic use or poor dietary habits. A healthy gut microbiome is linked to better digestion, reduced inflammation, and even mental well-being. However, the quantity and strains vary by brand and brew method. Kombucha contains enzymes and organic acids like acetic acid and gluconic acid, which may assist in breaking down food more efficiently. Anecdotal evidence and some early studies suggest that regular consumption of kombucha may alleviate bloating, gas, and indigestion by supporting the body's natural digestive processes. Green or black tea, the base for kombucha, is rich in polyphenols and antioxidants. These compounds can protect the gut lining from oxidative stress and inflammation. Damage to the gut lining is often associated with leaky gut syndrome, food sensitivities, and autoimmune responses, making antioxidant support beneficial for long-term gut health. About 70% of your immune system resides in your gut. A healthy gut microbiome can help modulate immune responses. The probiotics in kombucha may help maintain this balance, reducing your susceptibility to infections and inflammatory responses. While more human clinical trials are needed, the existing data is promising. Gut dysbiosis, or an imbalance in gut microbes, has been linked to several conditions like irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), obesity, and even depression. Regular intake of fermented foods, including kombucha, may help prevent or correct such imbalances. A study in Nutrients (2021) reported that probiotic-rich foods could improve symptoms in individuals with mild digestive disorders. While kombucha is primarily known for probiotics, it may also contain small amounts of prebiotics depending on its ingredients. Prebiotics are plant fibres that feed good bacteria. Ingredients like ginger or fruit add-ins in kombucha may enhance this effect, offering additional gut support. Despite its benefits, kombucha is not suitable for everyone. Unpasteurised kombucha can pose a risk for pregnant women, individuals with weakened immune systems, or those sensitive to caffeine or alcohol. Additionally, many commercial versions contain added sugars, which can negate its health benefits. Always read labels and consult a healthcare provider, especially if you have pre-existing conditions. Kombucha offers potential gut health benefits, largely due to its probiotic content and natural fermentation. While more large-scale human studies are needed, current evidence supports its role as a gut-friendly beverage when consumed in moderation. For optimal results, pair kombucha with a fibre-rich diet and other fermented foods. As always, individual needs vary, consult a doctor before making it a daily habit.

https://doctor.ndtv.com/travel-and-health/7-hygiene-tips-to-keep-in-mind-while-travelling-8313687,7 Hygiene Tips To Keep In Mind While Travelling,"Updated: May 2, 2025 07:07 IST","Travelling opens up new experiences, but it can also expose you to unfamiliar germs and environments that may affect your health. Whether you're heading to a beach destination, trekking through the hills, or taking a business trip, maintaining personal hygiene is essential to prevent infections, digestive issues, and skin conditions. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), proper hand hygiene and safe food practices are critical during travel to avoid communicable diseases. With packed itineraries and limited access to clean facilities, hygiene can often take a back seat. Here are 7 essential hygiene tips to help you stay healthy and safe while travelling. Travelling brings increased contact with public surfaces, shared restrooms, and changing food habits, all of which can heighten your risk of infections. From traveller's diarrhoea to respiratory illnesses, poor hygiene can quickly turn a vacation into a visit to the clinic. Being mindful of basic hygiene practices ensures you stay energetic, confident, and illness-free throughout your journey. Let's explore the science behind this fermented favourite. Let's explore why eating a few tulsi leaves every day could be a powerful step toward holistic well-being. Keeping your hands clean is your first line of defence. Always carry an alcohol-based hand sanitiser (at least 60% alcohol) and use it after touching public surfaces, handling money, or before eating. The WHO strongly recommends hand hygiene, especially when soap and water are not available, common while travelling. Trains, flights, and hotel rooms may not always be as clean as they appear. Use disinfectant wipes to clean surfaces such as tray tables, armrests, remote controls, toilet seats, and doorknobs. This reduces the chance of picking up germs left behind by previous users. Your hands touch dozens of surfaces every hour, escalator railings, cab doors, menus, and then may unknowingly transfer germs to your eyes, nose, or mouth. Avoid face-touching as much as possible to reduce the risk of respiratory and skin infections. Food-borne illnesses are common among travellers. Opt for freshly cooked meals and avoid raw, undercooked, or street food if unsure about cleanliness. Drink only bottled or filtered water and avoid ice cubes unless you're certain they're made with purified water. The Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) also recommends avoiding tap water in unfamiliar areas. Public toilets can be unhygienic, especially in remote or high-traffic areas. Carry toilet seat sanitisers, tissue rolls, disposable seat covers, and hand sanitiser. For longer trips, consider including intimate wipes and feminine hygiene products if needed. Maintaining toilet hygiene helps prevent urinary tract infections (UTIs) and skin issues. Sweat and grime accumulate more quickly during travel, especially in humid or hot destinations. Pack clothes made of breathable fabrics like cotton and change them daily. Avoid re-wearing socks or undergarments, as doing so may cause skin irritation or fungal infections. A small laundry bag or detergent sachets can help you keep your garments fresh. Skipping brushing during hectic travel days is common but harmful. Always carry a compact dental kit with a toothbrush, paste, floss, and mouthwash. Good oral hygiene not only prevents bad breath and cavities but also helps reduce the risk of infections that can spread through the bloodstream. Maintaining hygiene while travelling doesn't require complicated routines, it just needs awareness and a little preparation. By following simple yet effective practices, you can protect yourself from illnesses that might disrupt your journey. As travel resumes in full swing post-pandemic, personal hygiene is more crucial than ever. Stay cautious, stay clean, and enjoy a healthy, worry-free travel experience.

https://doctor.ndtv.com/nutrition/health-benefits-of-consuming-raw-tulsi-leaves-8313644,Health Benefits Of Consuming Raw Tulsi Leaves,"Updated: May 2, 2025 07:11 IST","Tulsi, also known as Holy Basil, is more than just a sacred plant in Indian households, it is a treasure trove of health benefits. For centuries, Ayurvedic medicine has revered tulsi for its therapeutic properties, and modern science now validates many of these claims. Consuming raw tulsi leaves regularly is believed to boost immunity, support respiratory health, improve digestion, and manage stress levels. The Ministry of AYUSH and organisations like the World Health Organisation (WHO) recognise the role of traditional herbs like tulsi in preventive healthcare. Let's explore why eating a few tulsi leaves every day could be a powerful step toward holistic well-being. Tulsi leaves are packed with powerful antioxidants, essential oils, and bioactive compounds like eugenol, ursolic acid, and rosmarinic acid. These natural substances offer anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, and adaptogenic effects that can protect your body from various ailments. Consuming the leaves raw ensures maximum potency, as heat or processing may diminish their active components. Let's explore the science behind this fermented favourite. With packed itineraries and limited access to clean facilities, hygiene can often take a back seat. Here are 7 essential hygiene tips to help you stay healthy and safe while travelling. Raw tulsi leaves strengthen the immune system by enhancing the body's ability to fight infections. They stimulate the production of antibodies and have natural antibacterial, antifungal, and antiviral properties. This makes them particularly helpful during seasonal changes or flu outbreaks. Regular consumption can reduce the frequency and severity of colds and fevers. Tulsi acts as a natural decongestant and expectorant, making it effective against respiratory ailments like asthma, bronchitis, and sinusitis. Chewing raw tulsi leaves can help clear phlegm, reduce cough, and ease breathing. Its antimicrobial nature also helps in managing bacterial infections of the respiratory tract. Tulsi is classified as an adaptogen, a natural substance that helps the body cope with physical and emotional stress. According to a study published in the Journal of Ayurveda and Integrative Medicine, tulsi significantly lowers cortisol (the stress hormone) levels and improves mood stability. Chewing raw leaves may help relieve anxiety and promote mental clarity. The compounds in tulsi help balance stomach acids, support healthy gut flora, and relieve digestive issues like bloating, gas, and indigestion. Chewing raw tulsi leaves before or after meals may stimulate digestive enzymes and promote smoother digestion. Tulsi's antibacterial properties make it excellent for oral hygiene. Chewing the leaves can help reduce bad breath, gum infections, and mouth ulcers. It also offers protection against oral pathogens that cause plaque formation and tooth decay. Studies suggest that tulsi may help regulate blood glucose levels, making it beneficial for people with type 2 diabetes. According to research in the International Journal of Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics, tulsi can reduce fasting blood sugar and improve insulin sensitivity. Consuming raw leaves in the morning on an empty stomach may help manage sugar levels. Tulsi helps the body flush out toxins by supporting liver and kidney function. It also contains antioxidants that neutralise free radicals and reduce oxidative stress, promoting overall cellular health. Drinking water infused with raw tulsi leaves is a common detox remedy in many Indian households. Raw tulsi leaves are a natural powerhouse offering preventive and therapeutic health benefits. From boosting immunity and aiding digestion to reducing stress and balancing sugar levels, they support overall wellness without side effects. However, moderation is key, consuming 2-3 leaves daily is sufficient. For those seeking natural ways to enhance health, tulsi could be a small but mighty addition to your routine.

https://doctor.ndtv.com/living-healthy/natural-detox-remedies-for-smokers-and-alcoholics-8313618,Natural Detox Remedies For Smokers And Alcoholics,"Updated: May 2, 2025 07:18 IST","Tobacco and alcohol use are two of the most common lifestyle choices that negatively impact the body's vital organs, especially the liver, lungs, heart, and kidneys. While quitting is the best option, the recovery and detoxification process can be supported naturally. Detox doesn't mean extreme fasting or relying on fancy juices, it involves helping the body eliminate toxins through the right foods, hydration, herbs, and lifestyle changes. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), supporting the body's detoxification systems is essential in substance abuse recovery. Here's how smokers and alcohol users can naturally cleanse their systems and boost their overall health. Alcohol and nicotine leave behind a trail of toxins that accumulate in the liver, lungs, and bloodstream. Over time, these can impair organ function, reduce immunity, and increase the risk of chronic diseases. Natural detox methods can help clear these harmful substances, support organ regeneration, and replenish essential nutrients depleted by prolonged smoking and drinking. Let's explore the science behind this fermented favourite. With packed itineraries and limited access to clean facilities, hygiene can often take a back seat. Here are 7 essential hygiene tips to help you stay healthy and safe while travelling. Water is crucial for flushing out toxins. Aim for at least 8–10 glasses a day. You can also drink detoxifying liquids like lemon water, coconut water, or cucumber-infused water. For alcoholics, hydration helps rehydrate the body and supports liver function. Smokers benefit as water helps clear tar and toxins from the lungs. Alcohol and cigarette smoke deplete your body of essential antioxidants like vitamin C, E, and beta-carotene. Include berries, citrus fruits, spinach, beetroot, carrots, and tomatoes in your daily diet. These foods help combat oxidative stress and reduce inflammation caused by toxic exposure. Milk thistle is an age-old herbal remedy known to support liver health. The compound silymarin found in milk thistle has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties that help regenerate liver cells. It's especially beneficial for alcohol-related liver damage. Always consult a doctor before adding supplements to your routine. Smokers can benefit from regular steam inhalation with essential oils like eucalyptus or peppermint to clear lung congestion. Additionally, practicing breathing techniques like pranayama or deep diaphragmatic breathing can improve lung capacity and help expel residual toxins. Green tea is rich in catechins and other antioxidants that help boost liver function and remove toxins. Other herbal teas like dandelion root tea, ginger tea, or turmeric tea support digestion, reduce inflammation, and assist detox pathways. Alcohol irritates the gut lining and alters gut flora, while smoking impacts nutrient absorption. Eating fibre-rich foods like oats, whole grains, flaxseeds, and leafy greens can promote healthy bowel movements and support gut detoxification. A healthy gut also supports immunity and mood regulation. Physical activity increases circulation, boosts metabolism, and promotes sweating, a natural detox pathway. Cardio, brisk walking, or yoga help smokers improve lung function and support alcoholics in liver healing. According to the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), exercise also helps reduce cravings and improves mental health during recovery. Both smokers and alcohol consumers should reduce intake of processed foods, sugary snacks, and refined carbs. These stress the liver and gut and increase inflammation. Opt instead for clean, home-cooked meals rich in proteins, healthy fats, and whole grains. Quality sleep is the body's natural time for healing. Nicotine and alcohol often disturb sleep cycles, but focusing on 7-8 hours of rest per night helps repair tissues, reset hormones, and support cognitive function during detox. Detoxifying from alcohol and smoking requires patience, consistency, and lifestyle adjustments. While no remedy is a substitute for quitting, these natural strategies can accelerate the body's healing process and reduce the risk of long-term damage. Always consult a healthcare provider when planning a detox, especially if you're undergoing withdrawal or treatment. Your body deserves a fresh start, nourish it well.

https://doctor.ndtv.com/living-healthy/these-abnormalities-on-your-hands-suggest-these-health-concerns-8313464,These Abnormalities On Your Hands Suggest These Health Concerns,"Updated: May 2, 2025 06:24 IST","Abnormalities on your hands can sometimes suggest underlying health concerns because the skin, nails, joints, and circulation in your hands are closely linked to internal systems like cardiovascular, nervous, metabolic, and immune functions. Subtle changes in color, texture, swelling, or nail shape can be early indicators of conditions like nutrient deficiencies, thyroid disorders, liver disease, or even autoimmune issues. Since the hands are so vascular and visible, they often show signs of internal imbalances sooner than other parts of the body. In this article, we outline various abnormalities of the hands and what they might indicate to.   Consistently cold hands may indicate poor circulation, low thyroid function (hypothyroidism), or Raynaud's disease, a condition that affects blood flow. If your hands stay cold even in warm conditions, it's worth checking your blood pressure and thyroid levels.  Mild hand tremors could be caused by caffeine or stress, but persistent shaking might be linked to neurological issues like Parkinson's disease or essential tremor. It can also signal thyroid overactivity (hyperthyroidism).  When the tips of the fingers swell and nails curve downward, it may point to oxygen deprivation in the blood, often associated with lung diseases, heart conditions, or even liver issues.  Yellow nails might suggest fungal infections, chronic bronchitis, or lymphedema, while pale nails can indicate anaemia. Bluish nails could mean a lack of oxygen in the blood, possibly related to heart or lung disorders.  Swelling in the fingers that doesn't go away may be due to arthritis, kidney disease, or hormonal imbalances. Inflammation and fluid retention can both be signs of internal stress.  Persistent rashes on the hands can be due to eczema or psoriasis, but they might also be triggered by autoimmune diseases or allergic reactions to medications or foods.  Frequent peeling may signal vitamin B deficiency, especially B3 (niacin) or B7 (biotin), or even dehydration. It can also result from overexposure to harsh soaps and sanitisers, which compromise the skin barrier.  These sensations may suggest nerve compression, such as carpal tunnel syndrome, or more systemic issues like diabetes, which affects nerve health. It could also be a sign of vitamin B12 deficiency.  These could be harmless bruises from trauma, but if unexplained, a dark line under the nail could point to melanoma, a type of skin cancer. It's something that should be evaluated quickly.  A sudden decline in grip strength can be a sign of nerve problems, muscle wasting, or even early rheumatoid arthritis. It can also reflect overall decline in physical health, especially in older adults.  Paying attention to persistent or unusual changes in the hands can help in early detection and timely management of several health conditions.

https://doctor.ndtv.com/health-supplements/these-supplements-may-be-harming-your-kidneys-8310922,These Supplements May Be Harming Your Kidneys,"Updated: May 2, 2025 01:04 IST","Supplements can be harmful to the kidneys, especially when taken in excess or without proper medical guidance. The kidneys are responsible for filtering waste and toxins from the blood, and certain supplements can overburden this system, leading to damage or worsening existing kidney conditions. Some supplements contain substances that are directly toxic to the kidneys, while others can interfere with medications, alter fluid and electrolyte balance, or contribute to the formation of kidney stones. Read on as we share a list of supplements that might be harming your kidneys.   Vitamin D is essential for bone health and immune function, but excessive intake can raise calcium levels in the blood. This condition, called hypercalcemia, can strain the kidneys and lead to the formation of calcium-based kidney stones. Prolonged high calcium levels may also cause calcification in kidney tissues, impairing their function.  Common among athletes and bodybuilders, creatine is used to enhance muscle performance. However, high doses or prolonged use can stress the kidneys by increasing the amount of creatinine, a waste product that kidneys must filter. In people with existing kidney conditions, creatine can accelerate damage.  Protein is essential, but overconsumption especially through supplements can overwork the kidneys. Excess protein increases the nitrogen load in the blood, which the kidneys must excrete. This can lead to glomerular hyper-filtration and, over time, may contribute to kidney damage, especially in people with underlying kidney disease.  Willow bark and similar herbal supplements contain salicylates, similar to aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). These can reduce blood flow to the kidneys and interfere with their ability to regulate salt and water balance, potentially leading to acute kidney injury, especially when used frequently or in combination with dehydration.  While vitamin C is water-soluble and generally considered safe, large doses (over 2,000 mg/day) can increase oxalate production in the body. Oxalate can bind with calcium to form crystals, which may accumulate in the kidneys as stones. Chronic overuse of vitamin C supplements has been linked to oxalate nephropathy, a serious kidney condition.  Used for digestive issues and adrenal fatigue, licorice root contains glycyrrhizin, which can lead to elevated blood pressure and low potassium levels, a condition known as hypokalaemia. These effects can strain kidney function, especially in people with pre-existing heart or kidney conditions. Chronic use has been associated with fluid retention and electrolyte imbalances that impair renal health.  While magnesium is vital for muscle and nerve function, taking too much, especially in supplement form can be harmful, particularly in people with reduced kidney function. Healthy kidneys usually excrete excess magnesium, but when they are impaired, magnesium can accumulate in the body, causing symptoms like nausea, low blood pressure, and, in severe cases, kidney toxicity or even cardiac arrest.  Even healthy individuals may be at risk if they use high doses over a prolonged period or combine multiple supplements without supervision.

https://doctor.ndtv.com/nutrition/7-long-term-health-risks-of-ultra-processed-foods-8305993,7 Long-Term Health Risks Of Ultra-Processed Foods,"Updated: May 1, 2025 09:03 IST","Ultra-processed foods, those high in artificial additives, refined sugars, saturated fats, and preservatives, have become a convenient part of modern diets. From packaged snacks to sugary drinks, these foods are everywhere. However, the long-term health consequences are alarming. According to a 2023 report by the World Health Organisation (WHO), diets rich in ultra-processed foods are linked to a range of chronic conditions including obesity, type 2 diabetes, and heart disease. The issue isn't just about empty calories, it's about the chemical processing that strips food of its natural nutritional value and may harm your body over time. Here's what you need to know. Ultra-processed foods often contain high levels of sugar, unhealthy fats, sodium, and chemical additives that can disrupt metabolic health. They are designed for shelf life and taste, not nutrition. As per Harvard Health and WHO, consistent consumption of such foods can trigger inflammation, hormone imbalance, and poor gut health, increasing your risk of lifestyle diseases and even some cancers over time. Let's explore the science behind this fermented favourite. With packed itineraries and limited access to clean facilities, hygiene can often take a back seat. Here are 7 essential hygiene tips to help you stay healthy and safe while travelling. Ultra-processed foods are calorie-dense and nutrient-poor. They promote overeating due to their addictive combinations of sugar, salt, and fat. These foods also bypass normal satiety signals, leading to weight gain. A study published in Cell Metabolism (2019) found that people who ate ultra-processed foods consumed 500 more calories daily compared to those eating whole foods, significantly increasing their risk of obesity. The high glycemic index of ultra-processed foods spikes blood sugar levels rapidly. Over time, this can lead to insulin resistance and eventually type 2 diabetes. The British Medical Journal (BMJ) published findings indicating a 12% higher risk of diabetes among individuals who frequently consumed ultra-processed items, including sugary drinks, refined cereals, and packaged desserts. High sodium and trans fat content in ultra-processed foods can elevate blood pressure and cholesterol levels. This significantly increases the risk of cardiovascular diseases. The American Heart Association warns that even moderate consumption of these foods may contribute to arterial plaque buildup and hypertension, particularly in middle-aged adults. Emerging evidence links frequent intake of ultra-processed foods to an elevated cancer risk. A French study in The BMJ found that a 10% increase in ultra-processed food consumption was associated with a 12% higher risk of cancer. Additives like emulsifiers, nitrates, and artificial sweeteners may disrupt gut microbiota and promote carcinogenic activity. Ultra-processed foods are low in fibre and high in chemical additives that can damage the gut lining. They disturb the natural balance of healthy bacteria, leading to issues like bloating, constipation, or even inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). A healthy gut is vital for immune and mental health, and long-term exposure to these foods can compromise both. Research suggests a correlation between ultra-processed food consumption and mood disorders such as depression and anxiety. A study in Public Health Nutrition linked these diets with a 30% increase in the likelihood of experiencing depression. These foods lack essential nutrients like B-vitamins and omega-3 fatty acids, which support brain function. A large-scale Spanish cohort study concluded that those who consumed more than four servings of ultra-processed foods per day had a 62% higher risk of all-cause mortality. Regular intake of these foods affects multiple systems in the body, metabolic, cardiovascular, and immune, leading to accelerated aging and disease vulnerability. Ultra-processed foods may offer convenience, but the long-term health risks are far too significant to ignore. From metabolic dysfunction to increased cancer and mortality risks, their impact spans the entire body. Reducing intake and choosing whole, minimally processed foods can drastically improve overall health. As always, consult your doctor or a dietitian for personalised dietary guidance.

https://doctor.ndtv.com/sexual-health/5-tips-to-improve-your-reproductive-health-8305983,5 Tips To Improve Your Reproductive Health,"Updated: May 1, 2025 08:57 IST","Reproductive health is a crucial component of overall well-being, impacting not just fertility but hormonal balance, emotional stability, and quality of life. For both men and women, maintaining good reproductive health involves a combination of lifestyle choices, dietary habits, and regular medical check-ups. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), reproductive health addresses the proper functioning of reproductive organs, safe sex, and the ability to reproduce with dignity and confidence. Whether you're planning a family or just want to optimise your wellness, focusing on your reproductive health today can help prevent complications in the future. Reproductive health is not only about treating infertility, it's about prevention and holistic care. Small, sustainable lifestyle changes can significantly improve reproductive health and enhance fertility. Here are five essential tips that support better reproductive function. Let's explore the science behind this fermented favourite. With packed itineraries and limited access to clean facilities, hygiene can often take a back seat. Here are 7 essential hygiene tips to help you stay healthy and safe while travelling. A diet rich in antioxidants, vitamins, and minerals plays a vital role in hormone regulation and reproductive organ function. Nutrients like folic acid, zinc, omega-3 fatty acids, and vitamin D are especially important. a. For women Leafy greens, legumes, citrus fruits, and whole grains can support ovulation and hormonal balance. b. For men Foods like walnuts, tomatoes, and pumpkin seeds may improve sperm quality and motility. Avoid trans fats, highly processed foods, and excessive sugar, all of which can contribute to hormonal imbalances. Physical activity helps maintain a healthy weight, improve circulation, and reduce stress, all of which are key for reproductive health. Obesity is linked to hormonal disruption, ovulatory dysfunction in women, and low testosterone levels in men. a. Aim for 150 minutes of moderate exercise per week, such as walking, cycling, or yoga. b. Avoid excessive or intense training routines, as over-exercising may suppress reproductive hormones and reduce fertility. Practising safe sex protects against sexually transmitted infections (STIs), many of which can lead to infertility if untreated. The Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) highlights that infections like chlamydia and gonorrhoea often have no symptoms but can cause lasting damage. a. Use protection such as condoms during intercourse. b. Get tested regularly if you have multiple partners. c. Urinate after intercourse to prevent urinary tract infections (UTIs), which can affect reproductive organs. Chronic stress can interfere with the production of key reproductive hormones such as oestrogen, progesterone, and testosterone. Stress also affects libido and the ability to conceive. a. Practice mindfulness, meditation, or deep breathing exercises. b. Ensure adequate sleep (7-9 hours per night). c. Consider speaking to a therapist or counsellor if you feel overwhelmed or anxious. d. Reducing stress not only improves mood but also enhances reproductive hormone function and sexual health. Routine visits to a gynaecologist (for women) or andrologist/urologist (for men) help identify issues early. Fertility tests, hormone panels, and pelvic exams can catch concerns before they escalate. a. Women should get regular Pap smears, HPV tests, and monitor menstrual irregularities. b. Men can benefit from semen analysis and testosterone level assessments if facing fertility issues. c. Timely intervention can treat or reverse many causes of infertility and improve long-term reproductive health. Reproductive health is not just about reproduction, it's about maintaining hormonal balance, physical well-being, and emotional stability. By adopting a healthy lifestyle, being proactive with check-ups, and protecting against infections, both men and women can support their reproductive systems.

https://doctor.ndtv.com/ear/heres-what-your-earwax-reveals-about-health-8305945,Here's What Your Earwax Reveals About Health,"Updated: May 1, 2025 08:41 IST","Earwax, technically known as cerumen, might seem like an unpleasant byproduct of the body, but it serves several important functions. It traps dust, bacteria, and foreign particles, keeping the inner ear clean and protected. Surprisingly, its colour, texture, and amount can offer insights into your overall health. From infections to genetic markers, earwax may act as an early warning sign for certain conditions. According to the American Academy of Otolaryngology, earwax is a natural self-cleaning agent and a key indicator of ear health. Paying attention to changes in earwax could help detect potential issues before they become serious. Earwax isn't just about hygiene, it reflects what's happening inside your body. Variations in its colour, texture, or odour can point toward infections, stress, metabolic conditions, and even inherited traits. Understanding these subtle shifts can help you better monitor your ear and general health. Let's take a closer look at what different types of earwax may reveal. Let's explore the science behind this fermented favourite. With packed itineraries and limited access to clean facilities, hygiene can often take a back seat. Here are 7 essential hygiene tips to help you stay healthy and safe while travelling. One of the most basic distinctions in earwax is whether it's dry (grey and flaky) or wet (yellow to brown and sticky). This is determined by a single gene, ABCC11. Most East Asians have dry earwax, while people of African or European descent generally have the wet type. While this difference is harmless, it may also be associated with body odour tendencies. This is the most common colour and texture of earwax in children and young adults. It's sticky and traps debris efficiently. This type usually indicates a healthy, functioning ear canal. If you notice this and there are no symptoms like pain or hearing loss, there's likely no cause for concern. Dark-coloured earwax is often a sign of older cerumen that has collected dust or debris. However, very dark or black earwax can also be linked to oxidative stress, which may result from anxiety or environmental factors. Unless accompanied by discomfort or odour, it's generally harmless, but worth monitoring if it happens frequently. Earwax that appears white and flaky may suggest an underlying skin condition such as eczema or psoriasis, especially if there is associated itching or scaling near the ear canal. People with these conditions are also more prone to wax build-up and blockages. If your earwax is green or has a bad odour, it could indicate a bacterial infection in the ear canal. This may be accompanied by symptoms like pain, fluid discharge, or hearing issues. According to the National Institutes of Health (NIH), foul-smelling earwax is often an early sign of otitis externa or “swimmer's ear.” Thin, watery wax, especially if accompanied by popping sounds or ear pressure, may suggest fluid behind the eardrum, a symptom common in ear infections or sinus issues. This is particularly frequent in children and can impact hearing if untreated. If your earwax is tinged with blood, it might signal a scratch, ruptured eardrum, or even more serious issues like a tumour or chronic infection. The Mayo Clinic recommends consulting an ENT specialist if you notice blood in earwax, especially if paired with hearing loss or dizziness. Earwax is more than just an ear-cleaning mechanism, it can be a useful indicator of your inner health. By observing changes in texture, colour, and smell, you can detect early warning signs of infections, skin disorders, or even genetic traits.

https://doctor.ndtv.com/living-healthy/can-excessive-salt-intake-affect-your-mental-health-8305936,Can Excessive Salt Intake Affect Your Mental Health?,"Updated: May 1, 2025 09:06 IST","Salt is an essential part of our diet, helping maintain fluid balance, support nerve function, and regulate blood pressure. However, modern diets, particularly processed and packaged foods, have dramatically increased our daily salt intake beyond recommended levels. While excessive salt is widely known for contributing to high blood pressure and cardiovascular disease, recent studies have begun linking high sodium intake to mental health conditions. From increased anxiety to cognitive impairment, the effect of salt on the brain is becoming a growing concern. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), reducing salt intake is crucial not just for heart health, but for overall well-being. Your brain is highly sensitive to chemical changes in the body. Consuming too much salt may affect hormones, blood pressure, and inflammation, each of which can impact your mental health. Research is emerging that suggests a high-sodium diet could worsen symptoms of depression, anxiety, and even increase the risk of neurodegenerative diseases. Let's explore the science behind this fermented favourite. With packed itineraries and limited access to clean facilities, hygiene can often take a back seat. Here are 7 essential hygiene tips to help you stay healthy and safe while travelling. Excessive sodium has been linked to increased inflammation throughout the body, including the brain. A 2021 study published in Nature Neuroscience found that inflammation caused by high salt intake can impair neurons, especially in regions like the hippocampus that control mood and memory. Too much salt can lead to hypertension, which narrows blood vessels and restricts blood flow to the brain. Over time, this can cause cognitive decline, memory issues, and may even contribute to the development of dementia. The American Heart Association warns that uncontrolled blood pressure is a silent but significant contributor to brain damage. A high-salt diet can disrupt the gut microbiota, which in turn affects the gut-brain axis—a communication pathway between your digestive tract and brain. An imbalance in gut bacteria has been associated with increased anxiety and depressive symptoms. According to research from the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the gut microbiome plays a critical role in regulating mood and mental clarity. Salt influences the body's hormonal balance. A study from Hypertension journal showed that high sodium intake can increase cortisol levels, the body's primary stress hormone. Elevated cortisol has been linked with anxiety, irritability, and even depressive episodes. High salt consumption may lead to poor sleep quality, either by causing dehydration or increasing blood pressure overnight. Poor sleep is a well-known trigger for mental health issues, including irritability, low mood, and reduced concentration. Emerging research has shown that excessive salt intake could accelerate the risk of Alzheimer's disease. A 2020 study published in Cell suggested that high salt disrupts nitric oxide production, a compound essential for healthy blood vessels in the brain. Reduced nitric oxide impairs brain function and is associated with neurodegenerative conditions. People consuming high-sodium diets are more prone to experiencing mood fluctuations. Though the evidence is still evolving, studies from the Journal of Clinical Psychiatry note a possible correlation between high salt diets and an increased prevalence of depressive symptoms. While salt is vital in moderation, excessive intake poses serious risks beyond physical health, it can compromise brain function and mental well-being. Experts from the WHO recommend keeping salt intake under 5 grams per day. Reducing processed foods and choosing fresh, whole ingredients is a practical first step toward safeguarding both your heart and your mind.

https://doctor.ndtv.com/health-supplements/add-these-supplements-to-your-routine-as-the-weather-gets-hotter-8305930,Add These Supplements To Your Routine As The Weather Gets Hotter,"Updated: May 1, 2025 08:26 IST","Adding certain supplements during the summer can boost health by compensating for seasonal challenges like dehydration, fatigue, sun exposure, and nutrient loss due to sweating. As temperatures rise, the body's needs shift slightly, electrolyte balance becomes crucial, skin requires protection and repair, and energy levels can dip. Supplements can support hydration, enhance energy production, protect against oxidative stress from UV rays, and promote overall well-being when combined with a balanced diet and lifestyle. Read on as we share supplements to help you better manage your health this summer.   Increased sweating during summer can deplete essential electrolytes, leading to fatigue, dizziness, or muscle cramps. Supplementing with an electrolyte blend (especially one that includes sodium, potassium, and magnesium) helps maintain fluid balance, supports muscle function, and prevents dehydration. Look for sugar-free powders or tablets you can dissolve in water post-workout or after long hours in the sun.  Vitamin C is not only a powerful antioxidant but also supports collagen production, which is vital for skin repair after sun exposure. It helps protect against oxidative stress caused by UV rays and environmental pollutants. A daily supplement can strengthen immunity, reduce inflammation, and promote radiant skin during the summer months.  This fat-soluble antioxidant works alongside Vitamin C to protect skin cells from UV damage and oxidative stress. It also aids in repairing dry, sun-damaged skin. A typical supplement can support skin health, especially if you're spending more time outdoors.  Omega-3s help reduce inflammation, support heart health, and keep the skin hydrated and supple. Summer activities and sun exposure can dehydrate the skin and accelerate aging, and Omega-3s work to counteract this.  Digestive discomfort often increases in the summer due to travel, dietary changes, or heat-related food spoilage. Probiotic supplements support gut health, enhance nutrient absorption, and improve immunity.  Although summer brings more sunlight, many people still don't get enough Vitamin D due to sunscreen use or indoor lifestyles. Vitamin D supports bone health, immune function, and mood regulation. A supplement daily can ensure optimal levels, especially if you aren't spending long periods in direct sunlight.  Heat and physical activity can sap energy quickly, and B vitamins help convert food into energy and support stress management. A B-complex supplement boosts energy, enhances mood, and helps reduce fatigue, making it a great addition to your summer wellness kit.  Zinc helps regulate immune function, supports wound healing, and plays a role in reducing skin inflammation. It also helps the body adapt to stress and heat. A daily dose of 15–30 mg is generally safe and effective, especially during times of increased physical exertion or sun exposure.  Choosing the right summer-specific supplements can help you feel more energised, stay protected, and recover faster from heat-related stress. Add these supplements to your diet today to achieve these benefits.   Disclaimer: This content including advice provides generic information only.

https://doctor.ndtv.com/living-healthy/these-habits-can-be-beneficial-for-women-struggling-with-fertility-8302807,These Habits Can Be Beneficial For Women Struggling With Fertility,"Updated: May 1, 2025 01:41 IST","Lifestyle habits can be highly beneficial for fertility in women. While underlying medical conditions can contribute to fertility challenges, many women can improve their chances of conceiving by making intentional changes to their daily routines. Habits related to nutrition, stress management, sleep, physical activity, and exposure to environmental toxins all influence hormonal balance, ovulation, and overall reproductive health. Making healthy lifestyle choices can help increase your chances of conceiving. Keep reading as we share a list of habits you can adopt to boost your fertility.  In this article, we share tips that can help boost fertility in men during summer. Several studies suggest that day-to-day stress in women can lower the chances of getting pregnant.  Both being underweight and overweight can disrupt ovulation and hormone levels, which are essential for fertility. Excess fat can lead to higher oestrogen levels, while too little body fat can prevent menstruation altogether.  A diet rich in whole foods especially leafy greens, berries, whole grains, legumes, healthy fats, and lean proteins can provide essential nutrients like folate, iron, zinc, and antioxidants. These nutrients support hormone regulation, egg quality, and reduce inflammation, all of which are crucial for reproductive health.  Chronic stress can disrupt the delicate hormonal balance needed for ovulation and menstruation. Practices like yoga, meditation, deep breathing, or even hobbies and social time can help lower cortisol levels and create a more fertile internal environment.  High consumption of alcohol and caffeine has been linked to reduced fertility. While moderate caffeine (around 1 cup of coffee per day) is generally safe, limiting or avoiding alcohol altogether is advised for those trying to conceive, as it can interfere with hormone levels and egg quality.  Smoking harms reproductive health by accelerating egg loss and damaging the fallopian tubes. It also affects hormonal balance and may lead to early menopause. Avoiding all forms of tobacco and minimising exposure to secondhand smoke is vital for women trying to conceive.  Poor sleep affects hormone regulation, including the hormones responsible for ovulation. Aim for 7–9 hours of uninterrupted, restful sleep each night to support reproductive health and balance stress levels, both of which are key to fertility.  While regular physical activity helps maintain a healthy weight and reduce stress, overexercising can disrupt menstruation and ovulation. Moderate-intensity workouts like walking, swimming, or yoga are beneficial, while extreme endurance routines may harm fertility.  Understanding your menstrual cycle and recognising fertile windows can greatly increase the chance of conception. Using ovulation predictor kits, tracking basal body temperature, or paying attention to cervical mucus changes can help time intercourse more effectively.  Everyday chemicals found in plastics, cosmetics, cleaning products, and pesticides can act as endocrine disruptors. Reducing exposure to these by choosing natural or organic products and avoiding BPA-containing plastics can help protect hormonal balance and fertility.  Regular visits to a gynaecologist or fertility specialist can help catch and manage any medical issues like thyroid imbalances, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), or endometriosis that may impact fertility. Early detection and treatment are key to improving reproductive outcomes.  Adopting fertility-friendly habits can not only support natural conception but also enhance the effectiveness of medical fertility treatments.

Most of the time, mothers are worried about the well-being of their unborn child. However, too much stress can be harmful to both the mother and the baby. Pregnancy is a delicate phase that involves several physical, hormonal and psychological changes. A new study has revealed that stress during pregnancy can affect babies even before birth. The research has revealed that paternal stress can change small RNA molecules in the blood of newborns, especially in girls. Here's a guide to seven easily available biotin-rich foods that are beneficial and safe during pregnancy. Here we outline in detail the many benefits of exercising for seniors. Feeling stressed is common during pregnancy. High stress levels in pregnancy may contribute to several issues such as high blood pressure, which may increase the chance of preterm labor or low birth weight. Stress can also contribute to issues like preeclampsia, eclampsia, and fetal growth restriction. Studies also suggest that increased cortisol levels during pregnancy may increase cortisol levels in a fetus, increasing the risk of developmental issues. Emotional stress during pregnancy may also affect cognitive development and may lead to attention difficulties and behavioural problems in a child. 1. Practice relaxation techniques: Try deep breathing exercises, meditation, or yoga tailored for pregnancy. 2. Stay active: Gentle exercises are safe during pregnancy like walking. Staying physically active can help boost mood, reduce stress and also keep you fit during pregnancy. Always consult with your doctor to determine safe activities. 3.

https://doctor.ndtv.com/health-supplements/these-supplements-can-help-reduce-brain-fog-8296229,These Supplements Can Help Reduce Brain Fog,"Updated: Apr 30, 2025 06:16 IST","Brain fog is a non-medical term used to describe a state of mental fatigue or clouded thinking, where a person may struggle with concentration, memory, mental clarity, and alertness. It can feel like mental sluggishness or being “spaced out.” Causes of brain fog range from stress, poor diet, lack of sleep, hormonal imbalances, and sedentary lifestyle, to underlying conditions like hypothyroidism, inflammation, or nutrient deficiencies. Supplements can help reduce brain fog when it's linked to nutritional gaps, chronic inflammation, oxidative stress, or neurotransmitter imbalances. Keep reading as we list supplements you can add to your diet to reduce brain fog.   Omega-3s are essential fats found in fish oil that support brain structure and function. DHA, in particular, makes up a large portion of the brain's grey matter. These fats reduce inflammation, improve communication between brain cells, and are known to enhance memory and mood. People deficient in omega-3s often report mental fatigue, so supplementation can help restore clarity and focus.  Vitamin B12 is vital for energy production and nerve health. A deficiency can lead to fatigue, memory issues, and confusion, all classic symptoms of brain fog. Supplementing with B12 supports the production of neurotransmitters like serotonin and dopamine and helps maintain the protective sheath around nerves (myelin), which is essential for fast and clear communication between brain cells.  Found naturally in green tea, L-theanine promotes relaxation without sedation. It helps calm the mind, improve focus, and reduce mental clutter. When combined with caffeine, L-theanine can enhance attention and working memory while minimising the jitteriness caffeine sometimes causes. This makes it especially useful for managing stress-induced brain fog.  Ginkgo biloba enhances blood circulation to the brain, which helps deliver more oxygen and nutrients to brain tissues. This improved flow supports better concentration, mental sharpness, and memory retention. Ginkgo also has antioxidant properties that protect brain cells from oxidative stress, which is a key contributor to cognitive decline and fogginess.  Magnesium plays a role in over 300 enzymatic processes, including those related to brain and nervous system function. Low levels of magnesium can lead to irritability, anxiety, and poor concentration. Magnesium supplements, particularly magnesium threonate, have been shown to support synaptic plasticity and memory, helping clear brain fog caused by stress and sleep issues.  Acetyl-L-Carnitine also known as ALCAR supports energy production in brain cells by transporting fatty acids into mitochondria. It also helps produce acetylcholine, a key neurotransmitter involved in learning and memory. ALCAR has been shown to improve mental energy, clarity, and alertness, particularly in people experiencing fatigue or age-related cognitive decline.  Vitamin D plays a role in regulating mood, reducing inflammation, and supporting immune and brain health. Deficiency is often linked to depression, fatigue, and cognitive issues. Supplementing with vitamin D, especially in those who get little sunlight, can help lift brain fog by enhancing mood-regulating chemicals and reducing inflammatory responses in the brain.  Supplements work by supporting brain function, improving blood flow, reducing inflammation, and enhancing the production of essential brain chemicals.

It supports foetal development, enhances energy production, aids in metabolism, and helps maintain healthy skin, hair, and nails. According to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and World Health Organisation (WHO) guidelines, biotin deficiency during pregnancy can be more common than expected due to increased demand and changes in metabolism. Including biotin-rich foods in a prenatal diet can promote maternal and foetal health. Here's a guide to seven easily available biotin-rich foods that are beneficial and safe during pregnancy. Pregnancy increases the body's demand for essential nutrients, and biotin is no exception. It supports embryo development, helps convert food into energy, and plays a key role in forming enzymes necessary for cellular growth. Low biotin levels have been linked to birth defects in some studies. Hence, including biotin-rich foods is a natural way to support a healthy pregnancy. Try these 7 biotin-rich foods to include during pregnancy. Let's explore the science behind this fermented favourite. With packed itineraries and limited access to clean facilities, hygiene can often take a back seat. Here are 7 essential hygiene tips to help you stay healthy and safe while travelling. Egg yolks are one of the richest sources of biotin. Just one cooked egg yolk provides a good amount of this nutrient. Ensure eggs are fully cooked to avoid any risk of salmonella during pregnancy. Almonds, walnuts, sunflower seeds, and peanuts are not only rich in biotin but also contain healthy fats and protein. A small handful as a snack or sprinkled over salads can boost your biotin intake. Loaded with vitamins, fibre, and antioxidants, sweet potatoes also offer biotin. Their high vitamin A content also supports foetal eye and skin development, making them a pregnancy-friendly food. Bananas are rich in potassium and moderate in biotin, making them a great option for energy and nutrition.

https://doctor.ndtv.com/children/what-is-parasomnia-in-children-8295944,What Is Parasomnia In Children?,"Updated: Apr 30, 2025 06:09 IST","Sleep plays a vital role in a child's physical and mental development. However, certain sleep disorders like parasomnia can interrupt this essential rest. Parasomnia refers to unusual behaviours or experiences during sleep, including sleepwalking, night terrors, talking during sleep, or waking up confused. These disturbances, though often harmless, can be alarming for parents and caregivers. According to the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM), parasomnias are more prevalent in children than adults and usually occur during transitions between sleep stages. Early awareness and management can ensure better sleep hygiene and reduce risks associated with parasomnias in growing children. Parasomnias in children are typically classified into non-REM (NREM) and REM-related disorders. They can range from mild to severe, and while most children outgrow them, persistent symptoms may need medical attention. Here are the common types of parasomnias in children. Let's explore the science behind this fermented favourite. With packed itineraries and limited access to clean facilities, hygiene can often take a back seat. Here are 7 essential hygiene tips to help you stay healthy and safe while travelling. One of the most well-known parasomnias, sleepwalking involves a child moving around while still asleep. It usually occurs in deep NREM sleep and may involve aimless walking or attempts to leave the house. Safety precautions are essential. Unlike nightmares, night terrors cause a child to scream, sweat, and appear terrified, often with open eyes, but they won't be awake or responsive. These episodes typically occur early in the night and the child has no memory of them. Children experiencing this may wake up confused, disoriented, or upset. They might mumble or thrash around, but not be fully awake. These episodes usually happen during deep sleep and subside on their own. Common and usually harmless, sleep talking involves mumbling or even complete sentences during sleep. It's often triggered by stress, fever, or lack of sleep. Unlike night terrors, nightmares occur during REM sleep and are vividly remembered. If frequent, they may indicate emotional stress or trauma and can disrupt sleep quality. Although rare in children, sleep paralysis involves temporary inability to move or speak upon waking. It can be frightening but is usually harmless and linked to poor sleep cycles. Though often not classified strictly as parasomnia, persistent bedwetting in older children may coincide with other sleep disturbances and needs evaluation if it continues beyond the typical age. According to the National Sleep Foundation, common parasomnias include sleepwalking, night terrors, confusional arousals, and nightmares, often influenced by stress, fever, or irregular sleep schedules. A family history of parasomnias increases the likelihood in children. Irregular sleep routines and insufficient rest can trigger episodes. Emotional disturbances or trauma can contribute to nightmares and sleepwalking. High temperatures can increase the frequency of night terrors. Some drugs affecting the nervous system may induce parasomnias. Sudden noise or light changes during sleep can trigger abnormal sleep behaviours. Always consult a paediatrician if symptoms persist, worsen, or impact daytime functioning, early intervention can make all the difference in a child's wellbeing. Ensure regular bedtime and wake-up times. Avoid screens, loud noises, and caffeine before bed. These can reduce fear associated with night terrors or nightmares. Help children express emotions and reduce anxiety through play or therapy. Lock doors and windows, remove obstacles, and avoid bunk beds for sleepwalkers. If parasomnias are frequent or disruptive, a medical evaluation is advised. Parasomnia in children, while concerning for parents, is often a temporary phase that resolves with time and proper sleep hygiene. Understanding the types, triggers, and management strategies can provide reassurance and improve a child's sleep quality.

https://doctor.ndtv.com/living-healthy/7-common-triggers-of-migraine-in-summers-8295916,7 Common Triggers Of Migraine In Summers,"Updated: Apr 30, 2025 06:32 IST","For migraine sufferers, summer isn't always sunshine and happiness. Rising temperatures, intense humidity, and shifting routines can all become silent triggers. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO) and studies published by the American Migraine Foundation, environmental factors such as heat, dehydration, and bright light can exacerbate migraine episodes, particularly in warmer months. Understanding these seasonal triggers is essential for individuals who experience recurrent migraine attacks. By identifying and avoiding specific summer-related stimuli, people can reduce both the frequency and severity of migraines, leading to better control and an improved quality of life during the hottest months of the year. Summer heat can influence neurological and vascular systems, increasing the risk of migraines. Sudden weather changes, sun exposure, and poor hydration may lead to dilated blood vessels, a known contributor to migraines. According to the National Headache Foundation, these environmental factors often intensify the condition. Recognising these patterns is the first step toward prevention and effective migraine management. These are the most common triggers of migraine in summers. Let's explore the science behind this fermented favourite. With packed itineraries and limited access to clean facilities, hygiene can often take a back seat. Here are 7 essential hygiene tips to help you stay healthy and safe while travelling. Sweating more in the heat without replenishing fluids can lead to dehydration, a top migraine trigger. Even mild dehydration can cause headaches. Always carry water, and increase intake of fluids, especially when outdoors. Bright sunlight and high UV rays can overstimulate the brain's visual cortex. Prolonged exposure can lead to photophobia (light sensitivity) and trigger migraines. Sunglasses, wide-brimmed hats, and limiting time outdoors during peak hours are essential. High temperatures combined with humidity can cause your body to overheat, disturbing internal temperature regulation and increasing the risk of migraine. Stay in cool environments and use fans or air-conditioning to reduce impact. Summer routines often lead to irregular eating. Skipping meals causes blood sugar levels to drop, a common migraine trigger. Eat light but balanced meals every 3-4 hours to maintain energy and avoid crashes. Longer days can disrupt the body's sleep-wake cycle, especially if you're staying up late or waking earlier. Poor or irregular sleep is directly linked to migraine episodes. Aim for 7-9 hours of quality sleep daily. Cold coffees, sodas, and energy drinks may seem refreshing but often contain caffeine and sugar, both of which can aggravate migraines. Sudden intake or withdrawal from caffeine can also contribute to headaches. Summer often brings stronger odours, perfumes, sweat, pesticides, or chlorinated pool water, all of which can trigger migraines in sensitive individuals. Also, increased pollen and pollution can worsen sinus inflammation, another migraine pathway. Simple changes like staying hydrated, regulating sleep, and protecting yourself from extreme heat and sunlight go a long way. With vigilance and preventive care, those prone to migraines can enjoy a more comfortable and pain-free summer season. 1. Maintain a migraine diary to track specific seasonal triggers 2. Use cooling face towels and stay indoors during high-heat hours (12-4 pm) 3. Eat hydrating foods like cucumbers, watermelon, and yoghurt 4. Avoid sudden exposure to air conditioning after extreme heat 5. Keep sunglasses and an umbrella handy when outdoors 6. Limit screen time to avoid light-triggered headaches 7. Try relaxation techniques like meditation or breathing exercises to reduce stress While migraines can feel unpredictable, recognising and managing summer-specific triggers can make a substantial difference.

https://doctor.ndtv.com/diabetes/7-high-glycemic-foods-diabetics-should-avoid-8295895,7 High Glycemic Foods Diabetics Should Avoid,"Updated: Apr 30, 2025 06:22 IST","Managing diabetes effectively requires more than just medication, it hinges heavily on dietary choices. One of the most important factors in diabetic nutrition is the glycemic index (GI) of foods. The World Health Organisation (WHO) and the American Diabetes Association (ADA) both highlight the importance of avoiding high-GI foods, as they can cause rapid spikes in blood glucose levels. These foods are quickly broken down into sugar, which makes them risky for people with type 2 or type 1 diabetes. Being aware of high-GI foods and replacing them with healthier alternatives is key to keeping blood sugar levels stable and avoiding complications. The glycemic index ranks carbohydrates from 0 to 100 based on how fast they raise blood sugar. High-GI foods (above 70) cause sharp increases in glucose, leading to insulin spikes. Over time, this can worsen insulin resistance and increase the risk of complications. Monitoring GI can help diabetics maintain stable sugar levels and support long-term metabolic health. Here are mentioned 7 high glycemic foods diabetics should avoid. Let's explore the science behind this fermented favourite. With packed itineraries and limited access to clean facilities, hygiene can often take a back seat. Here are 7 essential hygiene tips to help you stay healthy and safe while travelling. Made from refined flour, white bread has a GI of around 75. It lacks fibre and nutrients, leading to a fast release of sugar into the bloodstream. Opt for wholegrain or multigrain bread instead. Cornflakes and puffed rice cereals may seem convenient, but they are among the highest GI foods (GI 80+). Choose high-fibre oats or unsweetened muesli to prevent sugar spikes after breakfast. Polished white rice, especially when overcooked, has a GI above 70. It can significantly raise post-meal glucose levels. Brown rice, quinoa, or millets like bajra or jowar are much healthier alternatives for Indian diets. Potatoes have a naturally high starch content. Mashed potatoes, with a GI of 85 or more, are especially problematic. Sweet potatoes or boiled potatoes in moderation with fibre-rich meals may be safer. These are loaded with added sugars and lack fibre, causing an immediate sugar surge. Their GI is often above 75. Diabetics should stick to water, unsweetened herbal teas, or diluted fresh lemon water. Refined pasta is quickly digested and converted into glucose. It ranks high on the GI scale unless paired with fibre and protein. Whole wheat pasta or zucchini noodles offer better glycemic control. While nutritious, watermelon has a GI of 76. Though its glycemic load is moderate due to high water content, large servings can still cause a sugar spike. Limit portion size and balance with protein. Replacing these items with low-GI, nutrient-rich alternatives is a simple yet powerful step toward better health and a more balanced lifestyle. 1. Combine high GI items with protein or fibre to slow glucose absorption. 2. Avoid cooking starchy foods for too long, as this increases their GI. 3. Use the “plate method”: half veggies, one-quarter protein, and one-quarter whole grain. 4. Keep a food diary to track reactions to specific foods. Understanding and managing the glycemic index of your diet is crucial for diabetes care. By avoiding or limiting these high-GI foods, diabetics can maintain more consistent blood sugar levels and reduce the risk of long-term complications.

https://doctor.ndtv.com/living-healthy/is-kombucha-beneficial-for-your-gut-health-8313711,Is Kombucha Beneficial For Your Gut Health?,"Updated: May 2, 2025 07:13 IST","Kombucha, a fizzy fermented tea, has emerged as a popular health beverage across the globe. Touted as a natural probiotic, kombucha is often linked to improved digestion, better gut health, and even immune support. Made by fermenting sweetened tea with a symbiotic culture of bacteria and yeast (SCOBY), this ancient drink has been consumed for centuries. But does it really deliver on its health promises, especially for the gut? According to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and other studies, kombucha may play a supportive role in gut microbiome diversity. Let's explore the science behind this fermented favourite. Kombucha contains natural probiotics and bioactive compounds that may help balance gut bacteria and enhance digestion. During fermentation, beneficial bacteria and organic acids are produced, which can aid the gut microbiome. According to a review published in Frontiers in Microbiology, fermented foods like kombucha can positively influence gut flora, which is essential for nutrient absorption, immune function, and overall digestive well-being. With packed itineraries and limited access to clean facilities, hygiene can often take a back seat. Here are 7 essential hygiene tips to help you stay healthy and safe while travelling. Let's explore why eating a few tulsi leaves every day could be a powerful step toward holistic well-being. The fermentation process produces several strains of live beneficial bacteria, such as Lactobacillus and Acetobacter. These probiotics may help restore the balance of gut flora, especially after antibiotic use or poor dietary habits. A healthy gut microbiome is linked to better digestion, reduced inflammation, and even mental well-being. However, the quantity and strains vary by brand and brew method. Kombucha contains enzymes and organic acids like acetic acid and gluconic acid, which may assist in breaking down food more efficiently. Anecdotal evidence and some early studies suggest that regular consumption of kombucha may alleviate bloating, gas, and indigestion by supporting the body's natural digestive processes. Green or black tea, the base for kombucha, is rich in polyphenols and antioxidants. These compounds can protect the gut lining from oxidative stress and inflammation. Damage to the gut lining is often associated with leaky gut syndrome, food sensitivities, and autoimmune responses, making antioxidant support beneficial for long-term gut health. About 70% of your immune system resides in your gut. A healthy gut microbiome can help modulate immune responses. The probiotics in kombucha may help maintain this balance, reducing your susceptibility to infections and inflammatory responses. While more human clinical trials are needed, the existing data is promising. Gut dysbiosis, or an imbalance in gut microbes, has been linked to several conditions like irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), obesity, and even depression. Regular intake of fermented foods, including kombucha, may help prevent or correct such imbalances. A study in Nutrients (2021) reported that probiotic-rich foods could improve symptoms in individuals with mild digestive disorders. While kombucha is primarily known for probiotics, it may also contain small amounts of prebiotics depending on its ingredients. Prebiotics are plant fibres that feed good bacteria. Ingredients like ginger or fruit add-ins in kombucha may enhance this effect, offering additional gut support. Despite its benefits, kombucha is not suitable for everyone. Unpasteurised kombucha can pose a risk for pregnant women, individuals with weakened immune systems, or those sensitive to caffeine or alcohol. Additionally, many commercial versions contain added sugars, which can negate its health benefits. Always read labels and consult a healthcare provider, especially if you have pre-existing conditions. Kombucha offers potential gut health benefits, largely due to its probiotic content and natural fermentation. While more large-scale human studies are needed, current evidence supports its role as a gut-friendly beverage when consumed in moderation. For optimal results, pair kombucha with a fibre-rich diet and other fermented foods. As always, individual needs vary, consult a doctor before making it a daily habit.

Whether you're heading to a beach destination, trekking through the hills, or taking a business trip, maintaining personal hygiene is essential to prevent infections, digestive issues, and skin conditions. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), proper hand hygiene and safe food practices are critical during travel to avoid communicable diseases. With packed itineraries and limited access to clean facilities, hygiene can often take a back seat. Here are 7 essential hygiene tips to help you stay healthy and safe while travelling. Travelling brings increased contact with public surfaces, shared restrooms, and changing food habits, all of which can heighten your risk of infections. From traveller's diarrhoea to respiratory illnesses, poor hygiene can quickly turn a vacation into a visit to the clinic. Being mindful of basic hygiene practices ensures you stay energetic, confident, and illness-free throughout your journey. Let's explore the science behind this fermented favourite. Let's explore why eating a few tulsi leaves every day could be a powerful step toward holistic well-being. Keeping your hands clean is your first line of defence. Always carry an alcohol-based hand sanitiser (at least 60% alcohol) and use it after touching public surfaces, handling money, or before eating. The WHO strongly recommends hand hygiene, especially when soap and water are not available, common while travelling. Trains, flights, and hotel rooms may not always be as clean as they appear. Use disinfectant wipes to clean surfaces such as tray tables, armrests, remote controls, toilet seats, and doorknobs. This reduces the chance of picking up germs left behind by previous users. Your hands touch dozens of surfaces every hour, escalator railings, cab doors, menus, and then may unknowingly transfer germs to your eyes, nose, or mouth. Avoid face-touching as much as possible to reduce the risk of respiratory and skin infections. Food-borne illnesses are common among travellers. Opt for freshly cooked meals and avoid raw, undercooked, or street food if unsure about cleanliness. Drink only bottled or filtered water and avoid ice cubes unless you're certain they're made with purified water. The Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) also recommends avoiding tap water in unfamiliar areas. Public toilets can be unhygienic, especially in remote or high-traffic areas. Carry toilet seat sanitisers, tissue rolls, disposable seat covers, and hand sanitiser. For longer trips, consider including intimate wipes and feminine hygiene products if needed. Maintaining toilet hygiene helps prevent urinary tract infections (UTIs) and skin issues. Sweat and grime accumulate more quickly during travel, especially in humid or hot destinations. Pack clothes made of breathable fabrics like cotton and change them daily. Avoid re-wearing socks or undergarments, as doing so may cause skin irritation or fungal infections. A small laundry bag or detergent sachets can help you keep your garments fresh. Skipping brushing during hectic travel days is common but harmful. Always carry a compact dental kit with a toothbrush, paste, floss, and mouthwash. Good oral hygiene not only prevents bad breath and cavities but also helps reduce the risk of infections that can spread through the bloodstream. Maintaining hygiene while travelling doesn't require complicated routines, it just needs awareness and a little preparation. By following simple yet effective practices, you can protect yourself from illnesses that might disrupt your journey. As travel resumes in full swing post-pandemic, personal hygiene is more crucial than ever. Stay cautious, stay clean, and enjoy a healthy, worry-free travel experience.

https://doctor.ndtv.com/nutrition/health-benefits-of-consuming-raw-tulsi-leaves-8313644,Health Benefits Of Consuming Raw Tulsi Leaves,"Updated: May 2, 2025 07:11 IST","Tulsi, also known as Holy Basil, is more than just a sacred plant in Indian households, it is a treasure trove of health benefits. For centuries, Ayurvedic medicine has revered tulsi for its therapeutic properties, and modern science now validates many of these claims. Consuming raw tulsi leaves regularly is believed to boost immunity, support respiratory health, improve digestion, and manage stress levels. The Ministry of AYUSH and organisations like the World Health Organisation (WHO) recognise the role of traditional herbs like tulsi in preventive healthcare. Let's explore why eating a few tulsi leaves every day could be a powerful step toward holistic well-being. Tulsi leaves are packed with powerful antioxidants, essential oils, and bioactive compounds like eugenol, ursolic acid, and rosmarinic acid. These natural substances offer anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, and adaptogenic effects that can protect your body from various ailments. Consuming the leaves raw ensures maximum potency, as heat or processing may diminish their active components. Let's explore the science behind this fermented favourite. With packed itineraries and limited access to clean facilities, hygiene can often take a back seat. Here are 7 essential hygiene tips to help you stay healthy and safe while travelling. Raw tulsi leaves strengthen the immune system by enhancing the body's ability to fight infections. They stimulate the production of antibodies and have natural antibacterial, antifungal, and antiviral properties. This makes them particularly helpful during seasonal changes or flu outbreaks. Regular consumption can reduce the frequency and severity of colds and fevers. Tulsi acts as a natural decongestant and expectorant, making it effective against respiratory ailments like asthma, bronchitis, and sinusitis. Chewing raw tulsi leaves can help clear phlegm, reduce cough, and ease breathing. Its antimicrobial nature also helps in managing bacterial infections of the respiratory tract. Tulsi is classified as an adaptogen, a natural substance that helps the body cope with physical and emotional stress. According to a study published in the Journal of Ayurveda and Integrative Medicine, tulsi significantly lowers cortisol (the stress hormone) levels and improves mood stability. Chewing raw leaves may help relieve anxiety and promote mental clarity. The compounds in tulsi help balance stomach acids, support healthy gut flora, and relieve digestive issues like bloating, gas, and indigestion. Chewing raw tulsi leaves before or after meals may stimulate digestive enzymes and promote smoother digestion. Tulsi's antibacterial properties make it excellent for oral hygiene. Chewing the leaves can help reduce bad breath, gum infections, and mouth ulcers. It also offers protection against oral pathogens that cause plaque formation and tooth decay. Studies suggest that tulsi may help regulate blood glucose levels, making it beneficial for people with type 2 diabetes. According to research in the International Journal of Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics, tulsi can reduce fasting blood sugar and improve insulin sensitivity. Consuming raw leaves in the morning on an empty stomach may help manage sugar levels. Tulsi helps the body flush out toxins by supporting liver and kidney function. It also contains antioxidants that neutralise free radicals and reduce oxidative stress, promoting overall cellular health. Drinking water infused with raw tulsi leaves is a common detox remedy in many Indian households. Raw tulsi leaves are a natural powerhouse offering preventive and therapeutic health benefits. From boosting immunity and aiding digestion to reducing stress and balancing sugar levels, they support overall wellness without side effects. However, moderation is key, consuming 2-3 leaves daily is sufficient. For those seeking natural ways to enhance health, tulsi could be a small but mighty addition to your routine.

https://doctor.ndtv.com/living-healthy/natural-detox-remedies-for-smokers-and-alcoholics-8313618,Natural Detox Remedies For Smokers And Alcoholics,"Updated: May 2, 2025 07:18 IST","Tobacco and alcohol use are two of the most common lifestyle choices that negatively impact the body's vital organs, especially the liver, lungs, heart, and kidneys. While quitting is the best option, the recovery and detoxification process can be supported naturally. Detox doesn't mean extreme fasting or relying on fancy juices, it involves helping the body eliminate toxins through the right foods, hydration, herbs, and lifestyle changes. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), supporting the body's detoxification systems is essential in substance abuse recovery. Here's how smokers and alcohol users can naturally cleanse their systems and boost their overall health. Alcohol and nicotine leave behind a trail of toxins that accumulate in the liver, lungs, and bloodstream. Over time, these can impair organ function, reduce immunity, and increase the risk of chronic diseases. Natural detox methods can help clear these harmful substances, support organ regeneration, and replenish essential nutrients depleted by prolonged smoking and drinking. Let's explore the science behind this fermented favourite. With packed itineraries and limited access to clean facilities, hygiene can often take a back seat. Here are 7 essential hygiene tips to help you stay healthy and safe while travelling. Water is crucial for flushing out toxins. Aim for at least 8–10 glasses a day. You can also drink detoxifying liquids like lemon water, coconut water, or cucumber-infused water. For alcoholics, hydration helps rehydrate the body and supports liver function. Smokers benefit as water helps clear tar and toxins from the lungs. Alcohol and cigarette smoke deplete your body of essential antioxidants like vitamin C, E, and beta-carotene. Include berries, citrus fruits, spinach, beetroot, carrots, and tomatoes in your daily diet. These foods help combat oxidative stress and reduce inflammation caused by toxic exposure. Milk thistle is an age-old herbal remedy known to support liver health. The compound silymarin found in milk thistle has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties that help regenerate liver cells. It's especially beneficial for alcohol-related liver damage. Always consult a doctor before adding supplements to your routine. Smokers can benefit from regular steam inhalation with essential oils like eucalyptus or peppermint to clear lung congestion. Additionally, practicing breathing techniques like pranayama or deep diaphragmatic breathing can improve lung capacity and help expel residual toxins. Green tea is rich in catechins and other antioxidants that help boost liver function and remove toxins. Other herbal teas like dandelion root tea, ginger tea, or turmeric tea support digestion, reduce inflammation, and assist detox pathways. Alcohol irritates the gut lining and alters gut flora, while smoking impacts nutrient absorption. Eating fibre-rich foods like oats, whole grains, flaxseeds, and leafy greens can promote healthy bowel movements and support gut detoxification. A healthy gut also supports immunity and mood regulation. Physical activity increases circulation, boosts metabolism, and promotes sweating, a natural detox pathway. Cardio, brisk walking, or yoga help smokers improve lung function and support alcoholics in liver healing. According to the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), exercise also helps reduce cravings and improves mental health during recovery. Both smokers and alcohol consumers should reduce intake of processed foods, sugary snacks, and refined carbs. These stress the liver and gut and increase inflammation. Opt instead for clean, home-cooked meals rich in proteins, healthy fats, and whole grains. Quality sleep is the body's natural time for healing. Nicotine and alcohol often disturb sleep cycles, but focusing on 7-8 hours of rest per night helps repair tissues, reset hormones, and support cognitive function during detox. Detoxifying from alcohol and smoking requires patience, consistency, and lifestyle adjustments. While no remedy is a substitute for quitting, these natural strategies can accelerate the body's healing process and reduce the risk of long-term damage. Always consult a healthcare provider when planning a detox, especially if you're undergoing withdrawal or treatment. Your body deserves a fresh start, nourish it well.

https://doctor.ndtv.com/living-healthy/these-abnormalities-on-your-hands-suggest-these-health-concerns-8313464,These Abnormalities On Your Hands Suggest These Health Concerns,"Updated: May 2, 2025 06:24 IST","Abnormalities on your hands can sometimes suggest underlying health concerns because the skin, nails, joints, and circulation in your hands are closely linked to internal systems like cardiovascular, nervous, metabolic, and immune functions. Subtle changes in color, texture, swelling, or nail shape can be early indicators of conditions like nutrient deficiencies, thyroid disorders, liver disease, or even autoimmune issues. Since the hands are so vascular and visible, they often show signs of internal imbalances sooner than other parts of the body. In this article, we outline various abnormalities of the hands and what they might indicate to.   Consistently cold hands may indicate poor circulation, low thyroid function (hypothyroidism), or Raynaud's disease, a condition that affects blood flow. If your hands stay cold even in warm conditions, it's worth checking your blood pressure and thyroid levels.  Mild hand tremors could be caused by caffeine or stress, but persistent shaking might be linked to neurological issues like Parkinson's disease or essential tremor. It can also signal thyroid overactivity (hyperthyroidism).  When the tips of the fingers swell and nails curve downward, it may point to oxygen deprivation in the blood, often associated with lung diseases, heart conditions, or even liver issues.  Yellow nails might suggest fungal infections, chronic bronchitis, or lymphedema, while pale nails can indicate anaemia. Bluish nails could mean a lack of oxygen in the blood, possibly related to heart or lung disorders.  Swelling in the fingers that doesn't go away may be due to arthritis, kidney disease, or hormonal imbalances. Inflammation and fluid retention can both be signs of internal stress.  Persistent rashes on the hands can be due to eczema or psoriasis, but they might also be triggered by autoimmune diseases or allergic reactions to medications or foods.  Frequent peeling may signal vitamin B deficiency, especially B3 (niacin) or B7 (biotin), or even dehydration. It can also result from overexposure to harsh soaps and sanitisers, which compromise the skin barrier.  These sensations may suggest nerve compression, such as carpal tunnel syndrome, or more systemic issues like diabetes, which affects nerve health. It could also be a sign of vitamin B12 deficiency.  These could be harmless bruises from trauma, but if unexplained, a dark line under the nail could point to melanoma, a type of skin cancer. It's something that should be evaluated quickly.  A sudden decline in grip strength can be a sign of nerve problems, muscle wasting, or even early rheumatoid arthritis. It can also reflect overall decline in physical health, especially in older adults.  Paying attention to persistent or unusual changes in the hands can help in early detection and timely management of several health conditions.

https://doctor.ndtv.com/health-supplements/these-supplements-may-be-harming-your-kidneys-8310922,These Supplements May Be Harming Your Kidneys,"Updated: May 2, 2025 01:04 IST","Supplements can be harmful to the kidneys, especially when taken in excess or without proper medical guidance. The kidneys are responsible for filtering waste and toxins from the blood, and certain supplements can overburden this system, leading to damage or worsening existing kidney conditions. Some supplements contain substances that are directly toxic to the kidneys, while others can interfere with medications, alter fluid and electrolyte balance, or contribute to the formation of kidney stones. Read on as we share a list of supplements that might be harming your kidneys.   Vitamin D is essential for bone health and immune function, but excessive intake can raise calcium levels in the blood. This condition, called hypercalcemia, can strain the kidneys and lead to the formation of calcium-based kidney stones. Prolonged high calcium levels may also cause calcification in kidney tissues, impairing their function.  Common among athletes and bodybuilders, creatine is used to enhance muscle performance. However, high doses or prolonged use can stress the kidneys by increasing the amount of creatinine, a waste product that kidneys must filter. In people with existing kidney conditions, creatine can accelerate damage.  Protein is essential, but overconsumption especially through supplements can overwork the kidneys. Excess protein increases the nitrogen load in the blood, which the kidneys must excrete. This can lead to glomerular hyper-filtration and, over time, may contribute to kidney damage, especially in people with underlying kidney disease.  Willow bark and similar herbal supplements contain salicylates, similar to aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). These can reduce blood flow to the kidneys and interfere with their ability to regulate salt and water balance, potentially leading to acute kidney injury, especially when used frequently or in combination with dehydration.  While vitamin C is water-soluble and generally considered safe, large doses (over 2,000 mg/day) can increase oxalate production in the body. Oxalate can bind with calcium to form crystals, which may accumulate in the kidneys as stones. Chronic overuse of vitamin C supplements has been linked to oxalate nephropathy, a serious kidney condition.  Used for digestive issues and adrenal fatigue, licorice root contains glycyrrhizin, which can lead to elevated blood pressure and low potassium levels, a condition known as hypokalaemia. These effects can strain kidney function, especially in people with pre-existing heart or kidney conditions. Chronic use has been associated with fluid retention and electrolyte imbalances that impair renal health.  While magnesium is vital for muscle and nerve function, taking too much, especially in supplement form can be harmful, particularly in people with reduced kidney function. Healthy kidneys usually excrete excess magnesium, but when they are impaired, magnesium can accumulate in the body, causing symptoms like nausea, low blood pressure, and, in severe cases, kidney toxicity or even cardiac arrest.  Even healthy individuals may be at risk if they use high doses over a prolonged period or combine multiple supplements without supervision.

https://doctor.ndtv.com/nutrition/7-long-term-health-risks-of-ultra-processed-foods-8305993,7 Long-Term Health Risks Of Ultra-Processed Foods,"Updated: May 1, 2025 09:03 IST","Ultra-processed foods, those high in artificial additives, refined sugars, saturated fats, and preservatives, have become a convenient part of modern diets. From packaged snacks to sugary drinks, these foods are everywhere. However, the long-term health consequences are alarming. According to a 2023 report by the World Health Organisation (WHO), diets rich in ultra-processed foods are linked to a range of chronic conditions including obesity, type 2 diabetes, and heart disease. The issue isn't just about empty calories, it's about the chemical processing that strips food of its natural nutritional value and may harm your body over time. Here's what you need to know. Ultra-processed foods often contain high levels of sugar, unhealthy fats, sodium, and chemical additives that can disrupt metabolic health. They are designed for shelf life and taste, not nutrition. As per Harvard Health and WHO, consistent consumption of such foods can trigger inflammation, hormone imbalance, and poor gut health, increasing your risk of lifestyle diseases and even some cancers over time. Let's explore the science behind this fermented favourite. With packed itineraries and limited access to clean facilities, hygiene can often take a back seat. Here are 7 essential hygiene tips to help you stay healthy and safe while travelling. Ultra-processed foods are calorie-dense and nutrient-poor. They promote overeating due to their addictive combinations of sugar, salt, and fat. These foods also bypass normal satiety signals, leading to weight gain. A study published in Cell Metabolism (2019) found that people who ate ultra-processed foods consumed 500 more calories daily compared to those eating whole foods, significantly increasing their risk of obesity. The high glycemic index of ultra-processed foods spikes blood sugar levels rapidly. Over time, this can lead to insulin resistance and eventually type 2 diabetes. The British Medical Journal (BMJ) published findings indicating a 12% higher risk of diabetes among individuals who frequently consumed ultra-processed items, including sugary drinks, refined cereals, and packaged desserts. High sodium and trans fat content in ultra-processed foods can elevate blood pressure and cholesterol levels. This significantly increases the risk of cardiovascular diseases. The American Heart Association warns that even moderate consumption of these foods may contribute to arterial plaque buildup and hypertension, particularly in middle-aged adults. Emerging evidence links frequent intake of ultra-processed foods to an elevated cancer risk. A French study in The BMJ found that a 10% increase in ultra-processed food consumption was associated with a 12% higher risk of cancer. Additives like emulsifiers, nitrates, and artificial sweeteners may disrupt gut microbiota and promote carcinogenic activity. Ultra-processed foods are low in fibre and high in chemical additives that can damage the gut lining. They disturb the natural balance of healthy bacteria, leading to issues like bloating, constipation, or even inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). A healthy gut is vital for immune and mental health, and long-term exposure to these foods can compromise both. Research suggests a correlation between ultra-processed food consumption and mood disorders such as depression and anxiety. A study in Public Health Nutrition linked these diets with a 30% increase in the likelihood of experiencing depression. These foods lack essential nutrients like B-vitamins and omega-3 fatty acids, which support brain function. A large-scale Spanish cohort study concluded that those who consumed more than four servings of ultra-processed foods per day had a 62% higher risk of all-cause mortality. Regular intake of these foods affects multiple systems in the body, metabolic, cardiovascular, and immune, leading to accelerated aging and disease vulnerability. Ultra-processed foods may offer convenience, but the long-term health risks are far too significant to ignore. From metabolic dysfunction to increased cancer and mortality risks, their impact spans the entire body. Reducing intake and choosing whole, minimally processed foods can drastically improve overall health. As always, consult your doctor or a dietitian for personalised dietary guidance.

https://doctor.ndtv.com/sexual-health/5-tips-to-improve-your-reproductive-health-8305983,5 Tips To Improve Your Reproductive Health,"Updated: May 1, 2025 08:57 IST","Reproductive health is a crucial component of overall well-being, impacting not just fertility but hormonal balance, emotional stability, and quality of life. For both men and women, maintaining good reproductive health involves a combination of lifestyle choices, dietary habits, and regular medical check-ups. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), reproductive health addresses the proper functioning of reproductive organs, safe sex, and the ability to reproduce with dignity and confidence. Whether you're planning a family or just want to optimise your wellness, focusing on your reproductive health today can help prevent complications in the future. Reproductive health is not only about treating infertility, it's about prevention and holistic care. Small, sustainable lifestyle changes can significantly improve reproductive health and enhance fertility. Here are five essential tips that support better reproductive function. Let's explore the science behind this fermented favourite. With packed itineraries and limited access to clean facilities, hygiene can often take a back seat. Here are 7 essential hygiene tips to help you stay healthy and safe while travelling. A diet rich in antioxidants, vitamins, and minerals plays a vital role in hormone regulation and reproductive organ function. Nutrients like folic acid, zinc, omega-3 fatty acids, and vitamin D are especially important. a. For women Leafy greens, legumes, citrus fruits, and whole grains can support ovulation and hormonal balance. b. For men Foods like walnuts, tomatoes, and pumpkin seeds may improve sperm quality and motility. Avoid trans fats, highly processed foods, and excessive sugar, all of which can contribute to hormonal imbalances. Physical activity helps maintain a healthy weight, improve circulation, and reduce stress, all of which are key for reproductive health. Obesity is linked to hormonal disruption, ovulatory dysfunction in women, and low testosterone levels in men. a. Aim for 150 minutes of moderate exercise per week, such as walking, cycling, or yoga. b. Avoid excessive or intense training routines, as over-exercising may suppress reproductive hormones and reduce fertility. Practising safe sex protects against sexually transmitted infections (STIs), many of which can lead to infertility if untreated. The Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) highlights that infections like chlamydia and gonorrhoea often have no symptoms but can cause lasting damage. a. Use protection such as condoms during intercourse. b. Get tested regularly if you have multiple partners. c. Urinate after intercourse to prevent urinary tract infections (UTIs), which can affect reproductive organs. Chronic stress can interfere with the production of key reproductive hormones such as oestrogen, progesterone, and testosterone. Stress also affects libido and the ability to conceive. a. Practice mindfulness, meditation, or deep breathing exercises. b. Ensure adequate sleep (7-9 hours per night). c. Consider speaking to a therapist or counsellor if you feel overwhelmed or anxious. d. Reducing stress not only improves mood but also enhances reproductive hormone function and sexual health. Routine visits to a gynaecologist (for women) or andrologist/urologist (for men) help identify issues early. Fertility tests, hormone panels, and pelvic exams can catch concerns before they escalate. a. Women should get regular Pap smears, HPV tests, and monitor menstrual irregularities. b. Men can benefit from semen analysis and testosterone level assessments if facing fertility issues. c. Timely intervention can treat or reverse many causes of infertility and improve long-term reproductive health. Reproductive health is not just about reproduction, it's about maintaining hormonal balance, physical well-being, and emotional stability. By adopting a healthy lifestyle, being proactive with check-ups, and protecting against infections, both men and women can support their reproductive systems.

https://doctor.ndtv.com/ear/heres-what-your-earwax-reveals-about-health-8305945,Here's What Your Earwax Reveals About Health,"Updated: May 1, 2025 08:41 IST","Earwax, technically known as cerumen, might seem like an unpleasant byproduct of the body, but it serves several important functions. It traps dust, bacteria, and foreign particles, keeping the inner ear clean and protected. Surprisingly, its colour, texture, and amount can offer insights into your overall health. From infections to genetic markers, earwax may act as an early warning sign for certain conditions. According to the American Academy of Otolaryngology, earwax is a natural self-cleaning agent and a key indicator of ear health. Paying attention to changes in earwax could help detect potential issues before they become serious. Earwax isn't just about hygiene, it reflects what's happening inside your body. Variations in its colour, texture, or odour can point toward infections, stress, metabolic conditions, and even inherited traits. Understanding these subtle shifts can help you better monitor your ear and general health. Let's take a closer look at what different types of earwax may reveal. Let's explore the science behind this fermented favourite. With packed itineraries and limited access to clean facilities, hygiene can often take a back seat. Here are 7 essential hygiene tips to help you stay healthy and safe while travelling. One of the most basic distinctions in earwax is whether it's dry (grey and flaky) or wet (yellow to brown and sticky). This is determined by a single gene, ABCC11. Most East Asians have dry earwax, while people of African or European descent generally have the wet type. While this difference is harmless, it may also be associated with body odour tendencies. This is the most common colour and texture of earwax in children and young adults. It's sticky and traps debris efficiently. This type usually indicates a healthy, functioning ear canal. If you notice this and there are no symptoms like pain or hearing loss, there's likely no cause for concern. Dark-coloured earwax is often a sign of older cerumen that has collected dust or debris. However, very dark or black earwax can also be linked to oxidative stress, which may result from anxiety or environmental factors. Unless accompanied by discomfort or odour, it's generally harmless, but worth monitoring if it happens frequently. Earwax that appears white and flaky may suggest an underlying skin condition such as eczema or psoriasis, especially if there is associated itching or scaling near the ear canal. People with these conditions are also more prone to wax build-up and blockages. If your earwax is green or has a bad odour, it could indicate a bacterial infection in the ear canal. This may be accompanied by symptoms like pain, fluid discharge, or hearing issues. According to the National Institutes of Health (NIH), foul-smelling earwax is often an early sign of otitis externa or “swimmer's ear.” Thin, watery wax, especially if accompanied by popping sounds or ear pressure, may suggest fluid behind the eardrum, a symptom common in ear infections or sinus issues. This is particularly frequent in children and can impact hearing if untreated. If your earwax is tinged with blood, it might signal a scratch, ruptured eardrum, or even more serious issues like a tumour or chronic infection. The Mayo Clinic recommends consulting an ENT specialist if you notice blood in earwax, especially if paired with hearing loss or dizziness. Earwax is more than just an ear-cleaning mechanism, it can be a useful indicator of your inner health. By observing changes in texture, colour, and smell, you can detect early warning signs of infections, skin disorders, or even genetic traits. If in doubt, consult a medical professional rather than self-cleaning with cotton buds, which may worsen the issue.   Disclaimer: This content including advice provides generic information only.

However, modern diets, particularly processed and packaged foods, have dramatically increased our daily salt intake beyond recommended levels. While excessive salt is widely known for contributing to high blood pressure and cardiovascular disease, recent studies have begun linking high sodium intake to mental health conditions. From increased anxiety to cognitive impairment, the effect of salt on the brain is becoming a growing concern. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), reducing salt intake is crucial not just for heart health, but for overall well-being. Your brain is highly sensitive to chemical changes in the body. Consuming too much salt may affect hormones, blood pressure, and inflammation, each of which can impact your mental health. Research is emerging that suggests a high-sodium diet could worsen symptoms of depression, anxiety, and even increase the risk of neurodegenerative diseases. Let's explore the science behind this fermented favourite. With packed itineraries and limited access to clean facilities, hygiene can often take a back seat.

A 2021 study published in Nature Neuroscience found that inflammation caused by high salt intake can impair neurons, especially in regions like the hippocampus that control mood and memory. Too much salt can lead to hypertension, which narrows blood vessels and restricts blood flow to the brain. Over time, this can cause cognitive decline, memory issues, and may even contribute to the development of dementia. The American Heart Association warns that uncontrolled blood pressure is a silent but significant contributor to brain damage. A high-salt diet can disrupt the gut microbiota, which in turn affects the gut-brain axis—a communication pathway between your digestive tract and brain. An imbalance in gut bacteria has been associated with increased anxiety and depressive symptoms. According to research from the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the gut microbiome plays a critical role in regulating mood and mental clarity. Salt influences the body's hormonal balance. A study from Hypertension journal showed that high sodium intake can increase cortisol levels, the body's primary stress hormone. Elevated cortisol has been linked with anxiety, irritability, and even depressive episodes. High salt consumption may lead to poor sleep quality, either by causing dehydration or increasing blood pressure overnight. Poor sleep is a well-known trigger for mental health issues, including irritability, low mood, and reduced concentration. Emerging research has shown that excessive salt intake could accelerate the risk of Alzheimer's disease. A 2020 study published in Cell suggested that high salt disrupts nitric oxide production, a compound essential for healthy blood vessels in the brain. Reduced nitric oxide impairs brain function and is associated with neurodegenerative conditions. People consuming high-sodium diets are more prone to experiencing mood fluctuations. Though the evidence is still evolving, studies from the Journal of Clinical Psychiatry note a possible correlation between high salt diets and an increased prevalence of depressive symptoms. While salt is vital in moderation, excessive intake poses serious risks beyond physical health, it can compromise brain function and mental well-being. Experts from the WHO recommend keeping salt intake under 5 grams per day. Reducing processed foods and choosing fresh, whole ingredients is a practical first step toward safeguarding both your heart and your mind.

As temperatures rise, the body's needs shift slightly, electrolyte balance becomes crucial, skin requires protection and repair, and energy levels can dip. Supplements can support hydration, enhance energy production, protect against oxidative stress from UV rays, and promote overall well-being when combined with a balanced diet and lifestyle. Read on as we share supplements to help you better manage your health this summer.   Increased sweating during summer can deplete essential electrolytes, leading to fatigue, dizziness, or muscle cramps. Supplementing with an electrolyte blend (especially one that includes sodium, potassium, and magnesium) helps maintain fluid balance, supports muscle function, and prevents dehydration. Look for sugar-free powders or tablets you can dissolve in water post-workout or after long hours in the sun.  Vitamin C is not only a powerful antioxidant but also supports collagen production, which is vital for skin repair after sun exposure. It helps protect against oxidative stress caused by UV rays and environmental pollutants. A daily supplement can strengthen immunity, reduce inflammation, and promote radiant skin during the summer months.  This fat-soluble antioxidant works alongside Vitamin C to protect skin cells from UV damage and oxidative stress. It also aids in repairing dry, sun-damaged skin. A typical supplement can support skin health, especially if you're spending more time outdoors.  Omega-3s help reduce inflammation, support heart health, and keep the skin hydrated and supple. Summer activities and sun exposure can dehydrate the skin and accelerate aging, and Omega-3s work to counteract this.  Digestive discomfort often increases in the summer due to travel, dietary changes, or heat-related food spoilage. Probiotic supplements support gut health, enhance nutrient absorption, and improve immunity.  Although summer brings more sunlight, many people still don't get enough Vitamin D due to sunscreen use or indoor lifestyles. Vitamin D supports bone health, immune function, and mood regulation. A supplement daily can ensure optimal levels, especially if you aren't spending long periods in direct sunlight.  Heat and physical activity can sap energy quickly, and B vitamins help convert food into energy and support stress management. A B-complex supplement boosts energy, enhances mood, and helps reduce fatigue, making it a great addition to your summer wellness kit.  Zinc helps regulate immune function, supports wound healing, and plays a role in reducing skin inflammation. It also helps the body adapt to stress and heat. A daily dose of 15–30 mg is generally safe and effective, especially during times of increased physical exertion or sun exposure.  Choosing the right summer-specific supplements can help you feel more energised, stay protected, and recover faster from heat-related stress. Add these supplements to your diet today to achieve these benefits.   Disclaimer: This content including advice provides generic information only.

https://doctor.ndtv.com/living-healthy/these-habits-can-be-beneficial-for-women-struggling-with-fertility-8302807,These Habits Can Be Beneficial For Women Struggling With Fertility,"Updated: May 1, 2025 01:41 IST","Lifestyle habits can be highly beneficial for fertility in women. While underlying medical conditions can contribute to fertility challenges, many women can improve their chances of conceiving by making intentional changes to their daily routines. Habits related to nutrition, stress management, sleep, physical activity, and exposure to environmental toxins all influence hormonal balance, ovulation, and overall reproductive health. Making healthy lifestyle choices can help increase your chances of conceiving. Keep reading as we share a list of habits you can adopt to boost your fertility.  In this article, we share tips that can help boost fertility in men during summer. Several studies suggest that day-to-day stress in women can lower the chances of getting pregnant.  Both being underweight and overweight can disrupt ovulation and hormone levels, which are essential for fertility. Excess fat can lead to higher oestrogen levels, while too little body fat can prevent menstruation altogether.  A diet rich in whole foods especially leafy greens, berries, whole grains, legumes, healthy fats, and lean proteins can provide essential nutrients like folate, iron, zinc, and antioxidants. These nutrients support hormone regulation, egg quality, and reduce inflammation, all of which are crucial for reproductive health.  Chronic stress can disrupt the delicate hormonal balance needed for ovulation and menstruation. Practices like yoga, meditation, deep breathing, or even hobbies and social time can help lower cortisol levels and create a more fertile internal environment.  High consumption of alcohol and caffeine has been linked to reduced fertility. While moderate caffeine (around 1 cup of coffee per day) is generally safe, limiting or avoiding alcohol altogether is advised for those trying to conceive, as it can interfere with hormone levels and egg quality.  Smoking harms reproductive health by accelerating egg loss and damaging the fallopian tubes. It also affects hormonal balance and may lead to early menopause. Avoiding all forms of tobacco and minimising exposure to secondhand smoke is vital for women trying to conceive.  Poor sleep affects hormone regulation, including the hormones responsible for ovulation. Aim for 7–9 hours of uninterrupted, restful sleep each night to support reproductive health and balance stress levels, both of which are key to fertility.  While regular physical activity helps maintain a healthy weight and reduce stress, overexercising can disrupt menstruation and ovulation. Moderate-intensity workouts like walking, swimming, or yoga are beneficial, while extreme endurance routines may harm fertility.  Understanding your menstrual cycle and recognising fertile windows can greatly increase the chance of conception. Using ovulation predictor kits, tracking basal body temperature, or paying attention to cervical mucus changes can help time intercourse more effectively.  Everyday chemicals found in plastics, cosmetics, cleaning products, and pesticides can act as endocrine disruptors. Reducing exposure to these by choosing natural or organic products and avoiding BPA-containing plastics can help protect hormonal balance and fertility.  Regular visits to a gynaecologist or fertility specialist can help catch and manage any medical issues like thyroid imbalances, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), or endometriosis that may impact fertility. Early detection and treatment are key to improving reproductive outcomes.  Adopting fertility-friendly habits can not only support natural conception but also enhance the effectiveness of medical fertility treatments.

Most of the time, mothers are worried about the well-being of their unborn child. However, too much stress can be harmful to both the mother and the baby. Pregnancy is a delicate phase that involves several physical, hormonal and psychological changes. A new study has revealed that stress during pregnancy can affect babies even before birth. The research has revealed that paternal stress can change small RNA molecules in the blood of newborns, especially in girls. Here's a guide to seven easily available biotin-rich foods that are beneficial and safe during pregnancy. Here we outline in detail the many benefits of exercising for seniors. Feeling stressed is common during pregnancy. High stress levels in pregnancy may contribute to several issues such as high blood pressure, which may increase the chance of preterm labor or low birth weight. Stress can also contribute to issues like preeclampsia, eclampsia, and fetal growth restriction. Studies also suggest that increased cortisol levels during pregnancy may increase cortisol levels in a fetus, increasing the risk of developmental issues. Emotional stress during pregnancy may also affect cognitive development and may lead to attention difficulties and behavioural problems in a child. 1. Practice relaxation techniques: Try deep breathing exercises, meditation, or yoga tailored for pregnancy. 2. Stay active: Gentle exercises are safe during pregnancy like walking. Staying physically active can help boost mood, reduce stress and also keep you fit during pregnancy. Always consult with your doctor to determine safe activities. 3. Prioritise self-care: Take time for yourself daily. Engage in activities like reading a book, taking a warm bath or any activity that you find enjoyable and relaxing. 4. Eat right: Proper nutrition helps promote healthy development of the baby and also supports mental well-being. Focus on consuming a well-balanced diet. 5. Limit caffeine and sugar: Excessive caffeine and sugar consumption can contribute to anxiety and may impact your sleep. 6.

https://doctor.ndtv.com/health-supplements/these-supplements-can-help-reduce-brain-fog-8296229,These Supplements Can Help Reduce Brain Fog,"Updated: Apr 30, 2025 06:16 IST","Brain fog is a non-medical term used to describe a state of mental fatigue or clouded thinking, where a person may struggle with concentration, memory, mental clarity, and alertness. It can feel like mental sluggishness or being “spaced out.” Causes of brain fog range from stress, poor diet, lack of sleep, hormonal imbalances, and sedentary lifestyle, to underlying conditions like hypothyroidism, inflammation, or nutrient deficiencies. Supplements can help reduce brain fog when it's linked to nutritional gaps, chronic inflammation, oxidative stress, or neurotransmitter imbalances. Keep reading as we list supplements you can add to your diet to reduce brain fog.   Omega-3s are essential fats found in fish oil that support brain structure and function. DHA, in particular, makes up a large portion of the brain's grey matter. These fats reduce inflammation, improve communication between brain cells, and are known to enhance memory and mood. People deficient in omega-3s often report mental fatigue, so supplementation can help restore clarity and focus.  Vitamin B12 is vital for energy production and nerve health. A deficiency can lead to fatigue, memory issues, and confusion, all classic symptoms of brain fog. Supplementing with B12 supports the production of neurotransmitters like serotonin and dopamine and helps maintain the protective sheath around nerves (myelin), which is essential for fast and clear communication between brain cells.  Found naturally in green tea, L-theanine promotes relaxation without sedation. It helps calm the mind, improve focus, and reduce mental clutter. When combined with caffeine, L-theanine can enhance attention and working memory while minimising the jitteriness caffeine sometimes causes. This makes it especially useful for managing stress-induced brain fog.  Ginkgo biloba enhances blood circulation to the brain, which helps deliver more oxygen and nutrients to brain tissues. This improved flow supports better concentration, mental sharpness, and memory retention. Ginkgo also has antioxidant properties that protect brain cells from oxidative stress, which is a key contributor to cognitive decline and fogginess.  Magnesium plays a role in over 300 enzymatic processes, including those related to brain and nervous system function. Low levels of magnesium can lead to irritability, anxiety, and poor concentration. Magnesium supplements, particularly magnesium threonate, have been shown to support synaptic plasticity and memory, helping clear brain fog caused by stress and sleep issues.  Acetyl-L-Carnitine also known as ALCAR supports energy production in brain cells by transporting fatty acids into mitochondria. It also helps produce acetylcholine, a key neurotransmitter involved in learning and memory. ALCAR has been shown to improve mental energy, clarity, and alertness, particularly in people experiencing fatigue or age-related cognitive decline.  Vitamin D plays a role in regulating mood, reducing inflammation, and supporting immune and brain health. Deficiency is often linked to depression, fatigue, and cognitive issues. Supplementing with vitamin D, especially in those who get little sunlight, can help lift brain fog by enhancing mood-regulating chemicals and reducing inflammatory responses in the brain.  Supplements work by supporting brain function, improving blood flow, reducing inflammation, and enhancing the production of essential brain chemicals.

https://doctor.ndtv.com/pregnancy/7-biotin-rich-foods-for-a-healthy-pregnancy-8295970,7 Biotin-Rich Foods For A Healthy Pregnancy,"Updated: Apr 30, 2025 08:17 IST","Biotin, also known as vitamin B7, is a water-soluble B-complex vitamin that plays a crucial role during pregnancy. It supports foetal development, enhances energy production, aids in metabolism, and helps maintain healthy skin, hair, and nails. According to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and World Health Organisation (WHO) guidelines, biotin deficiency during pregnancy can be more common than expected due to increased demand and changes in metabolism. Including biotin-rich foods in a prenatal diet can promote maternal and foetal health. Here's a guide to seven easily available biotin-rich foods that are beneficial and safe during pregnancy. Pregnancy increases the body's demand for essential nutrients, and biotin is no exception. It supports embryo development, helps convert food into energy, and plays a key role in forming enzymes necessary for cellular growth. Low biotin levels have been linked to birth defects in some studies. Hence, including biotin-rich foods is a natural way to support a healthy pregnancy. Try these 7 biotin-rich foods to include during pregnancy. Let's explore the science behind this fermented favourite. With packed itineraries and limited access to clean facilities, hygiene can often take a back seat. Here are 7 essential hygiene tips to help you stay healthy and safe while travelling. Egg yolks are one of the richest sources of biotin. Just one cooked egg yolk provides a good amount of this nutrient. Ensure eggs are fully cooked to avoid any risk of salmonella during pregnancy. Almonds, walnuts, sunflower seeds, and peanuts are not only rich in biotin but also contain healthy fats and protein. A small handful as a snack or sprinkled over salads can boost your biotin intake. Loaded with vitamins, fibre, and antioxidants, sweet potatoes also offer biotin. Their high vitamin A content also supports foetal eye and skin development, making them a pregnancy-friendly food. Bananas are rich in potassium and moderate in biotin, making them a great option for energy and nutrition. They're also easy on the stomach, helping with morning sickness or nausea during the first trimester. This leafy green is packed with iron, folate, and biotin, nutrients essential for pregnancy. Consuming lightly cooked spinach helps absorb the nutrients more effectively while reducing oxalate content. Whole wheat bread, oats, and brown rice contain moderate levels of biotin along with fibre, iron, and B-complex vitamins. Opting for whole grains ensures long-lasting energy and digestive health during pregnancy. Milk, yoghurt, and cheese offer not just calcium and protein but also a decent dose of biotin. These are great options for women who tolerate dairy well and are looking to diversify their sources. From supporting foetal development to maintaining maternal energy levels, it's vital to include biotin-rich foods in your daily diet. 1. Opt for fresh, whole foods over processed supplements when possible 2. Combine biotin-rich foods with other B vitamins for better absorption 3.

https://doctor.ndtv.com/children/what-is-parasomnia-in-children-8295944,What Is Parasomnia In Children?,"Updated: Apr 30, 2025 06:09 IST","Sleep plays a vital role in a child's physical and mental development. However, certain sleep disorders like parasomnia can interrupt this essential rest. Parasomnia refers to unusual behaviours or experiences during sleep, including sleepwalking, night terrors, talking during sleep, or waking up confused. These disturbances, though often harmless, can be alarming for parents and caregivers. According to the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM), parasomnias are more prevalent in children than adults and usually occur during transitions between sleep stages. Early awareness and management can ensure better sleep hygiene and reduce risks associated with parasomnias in growing children. Parasomnias in children are typically classified into non-REM (NREM) and REM-related disorders. They can range from mild to severe, and while most children outgrow them, persistent symptoms may need medical attention. Here are the common types of parasomnias in children. Let's explore the science behind this fermented favourite. With packed itineraries and limited access to clean facilities, hygiene can often take a back seat. Here are 7 essential hygiene tips to help you stay healthy and safe while travelling. One of the most well-known parasomnias, sleepwalking involves a child moving around while still asleep. It usually occurs in deep NREM sleep and may involve aimless walking or attempts to leave the house. Safety precautions are essential. Unlike nightmares, night terrors cause a child to scream, sweat, and appear terrified, often with open eyes, but they won't be awake or responsive. These episodes typically occur early in the night and the child has no memory of them. Children experiencing this may wake up confused, disoriented, or upset. They might mumble or thrash around, but not be fully awake. These episodes usually happen during deep sleep and subside on their own. Common and usually harmless, sleep talking involves mumbling or even complete sentences during sleep. It's often triggered by stress, fever, or lack of sleep. Unlike night terrors, nightmares occur during REM sleep and are vividly remembered. If frequent, they may indicate emotional stress or trauma and can disrupt sleep quality. Although rare in children, sleep paralysis involves temporary inability to move or speak upon waking. It can be frightening but is usually harmless and linked to poor sleep cycles. Though often not classified strictly as parasomnia, persistent bedwetting in older children may coincide with other sleep disturbances and needs evaluation if it continues beyond the typical age. According to the National Sleep Foundation, common parasomnias include sleepwalking, night terrors, confusional arousals, and nightmares, often influenced by stress, fever, or irregular sleep schedules. A family history of parasomnias increases the likelihood in children. Irregular sleep routines and insufficient rest can trigger episodes. Emotional disturbances or trauma can contribute to nightmares and sleepwalking. High temperatures can increase the frequency of night terrors. Some drugs affecting the nervous system may induce parasomnias. Sudden noise or light changes during sleep can trigger abnormal sleep behaviours. Always consult a paediatrician if symptoms persist, worsen, or impact daytime functioning, early intervention can make all the difference in a child's wellbeing. Ensure regular bedtime and wake-up times. Avoid screens, loud noises, and caffeine before bed. These can reduce fear associated with night terrors or nightmares. Help children express emotions and reduce anxiety through play or therapy. Lock doors and windows, remove obstacles, and avoid bunk beds for sleepwalkers. If parasomnias are frequent or disruptive, a medical evaluation is advised. Parasomnia in children, while concerning for parents, is often a temporary phase that resolves with time and proper sleep hygiene. Understanding the types, triggers, and management strategies can provide reassurance and improve a child's sleep quality.

https://doctor.ndtv.com/living-healthy/7-common-triggers-of-migraine-in-summers-8295916,7 Common Triggers Of Migraine In Summers,"Updated: Apr 30, 2025 06:32 IST","For migraine sufferers, summer isn't always sunshine and happiness. Rising temperatures, intense humidity, and shifting routines can all become silent triggers. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO) and studies published by the American Migraine Foundation, environmental factors such as heat, dehydration, and bright light can exacerbate migraine episodes, particularly in warmer months. Understanding these seasonal triggers is essential for individuals who experience recurrent migraine attacks. By identifying and avoiding specific summer-related stimuli, people can reduce both the frequency and severity of migraines, leading to better control and an improved quality of life during the hottest months of the year. Summer heat can influence neurological and vascular systems, increasing the risk of migraines. Sudden weather changes, sun exposure, and poor hydration may lead to dilated blood vessels, a known contributor to migraines. According to the National Headache Foundation, these environmental factors often intensify the condition. Recognising these patterns is the first step toward prevention and effective migraine management. These are the most common triggers of migraine in summers. Let's explore the science behind this fermented favourite. With packed itineraries and limited access to clean facilities, hygiene can often take a back seat. Here are 7 essential hygiene tips to help you stay healthy and safe while travelling. Sweating more in the heat without replenishing fluids can lead to dehydration, a top migraine trigger. Even mild dehydration can cause headaches. Always carry water, and increase intake of fluids, especially when outdoors. Bright sunlight and high UV rays can overstimulate the brain's visual cortex. Prolonged exposure can lead to photophobia (light sensitivity) and trigger migraines. Sunglasses, wide-brimmed hats, and limiting time outdoors during peak hours are essential. High temperatures combined with humidity can cause your body to overheat, disturbing internal temperature regulation and increasing the risk of migraine. Stay in cool environments and use fans or air-conditioning to reduce impact. Summer routines often lead to irregular eating. Skipping meals causes blood sugar levels to drop, a common migraine trigger. Eat light but balanced meals every 3-4 hours to maintain energy and avoid crashes. Longer days can disrupt the body's sleep-wake cycle, especially if you're staying up late or waking earlier. Poor or irregular sleep is directly linked to migraine episodes. Aim for 7-9 hours of quality sleep daily. Cold coffees, sodas, and energy drinks may seem refreshing but often contain caffeine and sugar, both of which can aggravate migraines. Sudden intake or withdrawal from caffeine can also contribute to headaches. Summer often brings stronger odours, perfumes, sweat, pesticides, or chlorinated pool water, all of which can trigger migraines in sensitive individuals. Also, increased pollen and pollution can worsen sinus inflammation, another migraine pathway. Simple changes like staying hydrated, regulating sleep, and protecting yourself from extreme heat and sunlight go a long way. With vigilance and preventive care, those prone to migraines can enjoy a more comfortable and pain-free summer season. 1. Maintain a migraine diary to track specific seasonal triggers 2. Use cooling face towels and stay indoors during high-heat hours (12-4 pm) 3. Eat hydrating foods like cucumbers, watermelon, and yoghurt 4. Avoid sudden exposure to air conditioning after extreme heat 5. Keep sunglasses and an umbrella handy when outdoors 6. Limit screen time to avoid light-triggered headaches 7. Try relaxation techniques like meditation or breathing exercises to reduce stress While migraines can feel unpredictable, recognising and managing summer-specific triggers can make a substantial difference.

https://doctor.ndtv.com/diabetes/7-high-glycemic-foods-diabetics-should-avoid-8295895,7 High Glycemic Foods Diabetics Should Avoid,"Updated: Apr 30, 2025 06:22 IST","Managing diabetes effectively requires more than just medication, it hinges heavily on dietary choices. One of the most important factors in diabetic nutrition is the glycemic index (GI) of foods. The World Health Organisation (WHO) and the American Diabetes Association (ADA) both highlight the importance of avoiding high-GI foods, as they can cause rapid spikes in blood glucose levels. These foods are quickly broken down into sugar, which makes them risky for people with type 2 or type 1 diabetes. Being aware of high-GI foods and replacing them with healthier alternatives is key to keeping blood sugar levels stable and avoiding complications. The glycemic index ranks carbohydrates from 0 to 100 based on how fast they raise blood sugar. High-GI foods (above 70) cause sharp increases in glucose, leading to insulin spikes. Over time, this can worsen insulin resistance and increase the risk of complications. Monitoring GI can help diabetics maintain stable sugar levels and support long-term metabolic health. Here are mentioned 7 high glycemic foods diabetics should avoid. Let's explore the science behind this fermented favourite. With packed itineraries and limited access to clean facilities, hygiene can often take a back seat. Here are 7 essential hygiene tips to help you stay healthy and safe while travelling. Made from refined flour, white bread has a GI of around 75. It lacks fibre and nutrients, leading to a fast release of sugar into the bloodstream. Opt for wholegrain or multigrain bread instead. Cornflakes and puffed rice cereals may seem convenient, but they are among the highest GI foods (GI 80+). Choose high-fibre oats or unsweetened muesli to prevent sugar spikes after breakfast. Polished white rice, especially when overcooked, has a GI above 70. It can significantly raise post-meal glucose levels. Brown rice, quinoa, or millets like bajra or jowar are much healthier alternatives for Indian diets. Potatoes have a naturally high starch content. Mashed potatoes, with a GI of 85 or more, are especially problematic. Sweet potatoes or boiled potatoes in moderation with fibre-rich meals may be safer. These are loaded with added sugars and lack fibre, causing an immediate sugar surge. Their GI is often above 75. Diabetics should stick to water, unsweetened herbal teas, or diluted fresh lemon water. Refined pasta is quickly digested and converted into glucose. It ranks high on the GI scale unless paired with fibre and protein. Whole wheat pasta or zucchini noodles offer better glycemic control. While nutritious, watermelon has a GI of 76. Though its glycemic load is moderate due to high water content, large servings can still cause a sugar spike. Limit portion size and balance with protein. Replacing these items with low-GI, nutrient-rich alternatives is a simple yet powerful step toward better health and a more balanced lifestyle. 1. Combine high GI items with protein or fibre to slow glucose absorption. 2. Avoid cooking starchy foods for too long, as this increases their GI. 3. Use the “plate method”: half veggies, one-quarter protein, and one-quarter whole grain. 4. Keep a food diary to track reactions to specific foods. Understanding and managing the glycemic index of your diet is crucial for diabetes care. By avoiding or limiting these high-GI foods, diabetics can maintain more consistent blood sugar levels and reduce the risk of long-term complications.

https://doctor.ndtv.com/living-healthy/can-laughter-boost-your-well-being-8338425,Can Laughter Boost Your Well-Being?,"Updated: May 5, 2025 10:52 IST","Laughter is often called the best medicine, and for good reason. Beyond being a spontaneous response to humour, laughter has scientifically proven benefits for physical and mental well-being. According to the Mayo Clinic and the American Psychological Association (APA), laughter can lower stress hormones, boost immunity, improve heart health, and even relieve pain. In a world increasingly filled with pressure and anxiety, a hearty laugh may be the simplest tool to restore balance. But is it just a mood booster, or does laughter have long-term health implications? Let's explore how your chuckles can be good for your health. Studies from the Mayo Clinic and National Institutes of Health (NIH) confirm that laughter stimulates multiple body systems. It enhances oxygen intake, stimulates the heart and lungs, and releases feel-good endorphins. Over time, regular laughter can reduce stress, support mental clarity, and improve immune response, making it a valuable and natural form of daily self-care. According to the National Eating Disorders Association (NEDA), orthorexia often involves rigid rules, food-related anxiety, and social isolation. The Ministry of AYUSHrecommends seasonal diets aligned with Ayurvedic principles for better health and wellness during extreme weather conditions. Laughter lowers levels of cortisol and adrenaline, hormones linked to stress. A study published in the journal Alternative Therapies in Health and Medicine found that participants who laughed regularly had significantly reduced stress levels. A good laugh increases your heart rate and improves blood circulation, similar to light exercise. According to the American Heart Association, laughter may improve blood vessel function and reduce the risk of heart disease. Laughter boosts the production of natural killer cells, antibodies, and infection-fighting T-cells, helping the body ward off illness more efficiently, as observed by research cited by the National Cancer Institute. Endorphins released during laughter act as natural painkillers. Patients with chronic pain have reported reduced discomfort and improved tolerance after regular exposure to humour therapy sessions. Laughter is linked to lower levels of anxiety and depression. It encourages a positive outlook, promotes relaxation, and increases resilience during emotional hardship. Cognitive-behavioural therapists often use humour as part of treatment to reframe negative thoughts. Laughing together strengthens bonds and builds trust among people. Whether it's through shared jokes or funny stories, laughter creates a sense of belonging, which is vital for emotional well-being. Some studies suggest that laughter before bedtime may improve sleep by reducing muscle tension and lowering stress levels, contributing to deeper, more restful sleep. Laughter brings people into the present moment, similar to meditation. It encourages us to let go of overthinking and simply enjoy the here and now, a practice that improves overall mental clarity and peace. Watch a comedy show, join a laughter yoga group, recall funny memories, or simply spend time with playful people. The key is intentionality, seek humour in daily life and don't take everything seriously. As per Laughter Yoga International, even simulated laughter offers similar health benefits, as the body responds to it the same way as genuine laughter. Laughter isn't just a spontaneous reaction; it's a scientifically supported health booster. It improves mood, strengthens the body, and brings people closer together. So the next time you feel overwhelmed or tired, take a humour break, because sometimes, a good laugh is all the therapy you need. Remember, the best medicine is free and already within you.

But when this desire turns into an obsession, it might be something more serious, orthorexia nervosa. Unlike other eating disorders that focus on the quantity of food, orthorexia is an unhealthy fixation on the quality and purity of food. While not officially recognised by the DSM-5 (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders), growing awareness among psychologists and nutritionists worldwide suggests that orthorexia is a rising concern, especially in health-conscious societies. So how do you know if you're eating healthy, or crossing the line? Orthorexia starts with good intentions, avoiding processed foods, sugar, or additives, but escalates into an unhealthy obsession. According to the National Eating Disorders Association (NEDA), orthorexia often involves rigid rules, food-related anxiety, and social isolation. While clean eating promotes balance, orthorexia lacks flexibility, causing stress, malnutrition, and emotional distress despite appearing “healthy” on the surface. Over time, regular laughter can reduce stress, support mental clarity, and improve immune response, making it a valuable and natural form of daily self-care. The Ministry of AYUSHrecommends seasonal diets aligned with Ayurvedic principles for better health and wellness during extreme weather conditions. While it's wise to understand what goes into your food, orthorexic individuals may spend hours scrutinising every label, ingredient, and sourcing detail, often rejecting food not meeting self-imposed purity standards. Cutting out gluten, dairy, or carbs without allergies or intolerances may be a red flag. Orthorexia can lead people to eliminate foods not because of symptoms but based on misinformation or fear. Feeling morally “better” than others for your food choices is another sign. Orthorexia can create a divide between “good” and “bad” eaters, increasing social judgment and personal guilt around food. People with orthorexia often experience anxiety, guilt, or distress if they have to eat outside their dietary rules, such as at social events, family meals, or restaurants. Skipping gatherings or being overly rigid about where and what you eat may indicate that orthorexia is impacting your quality of life and isolating you socially. If a significant part of your day revolves around planning, sourcing, or preparing food with perfect standards, it may be more than just a healthy habit. Listening to your body is essential for well-being. People with orthorexia often ignore hunger or fatigue if they can't find food that meets their standards, prioritising purity over nourishment. Ironically, orthorexia can result in undernourishment. Eliminating too many foods might lead to deficiencies in protein, iron, B12, and healthy fats, impacting your overall health despite “eating clean.” If your eating habits are driven more by fear than by nourishment, it's time to pause. Seek help from a psychologist, dietitian, or a specialist in eating disorders. According to NEDA, early intervention improves recovery outcomes. Mindful eating, therapy, and balanced nutrition can help you reclaim a healthy relationship with food, body, and life. Orthorexia blurs the line between wellness and obsession. While being mindful of food is admirable, it should not control your happiness or isolate you. A truly healthy eater embraces flexibility, balance, and emotional well-being. If your eating habits are starting to limit your joy, reach out, because health is not just what you eat, but how you live.

According to Ayurveda, an ancient Indian system of medicine, summer aggravates the Pitta dosha, the energy responsible for heat, metabolism, and transformation in the body. To maintain balance, Ayurveda recommends specific cooling foods that help pacify Pitta, hydrate the system, and keep you energised throughout the hot months. Backed by holistic wisdom and now supported by nutrition science, these foods can be easily included in your daily routine for a more refreshing and healthier summer. Ayurveda believes food is medicine, and every season demands dietary adjustments. In summer, cooling and hydrating foods soothe the overheated body and prevent seasonal ailments. These foods balance your doshas, boost immunity, and improve digestion. The Ministry of AYUSH recommends seasonal diets aligned with Ayurvedic principles for better health and wellness during extreme weather conditions. Over time, regular laughter can reduce stress, support mental clarity, and improve immune response, making it a valuable and natural form of daily self-care. According to the National Eating Disorders Association (NEDA), orthorexia often involves rigid rules, food-related anxiety, and social isolation. Naturally sweet and packed with electrolytes, coconut water is considered a “Pitta-pacifying” drink. It cools the body, prevents dehydration, and aids digestion. It's also rich in potassium and magnesium, making it perfect for summer hydration. A powerhouse of Vitamin C, amla detoxifies the body and boosts immunity. Its cooling nature makes it effective in reducing body heat and improving skin health. Have it raw, as juice, or in the form of chyawanprash. Light, probiotic-rich, and cooling, buttermilk improves digestion and prevents bloating caused by heat. Seasoned with cumin and coriander, it enhances its detoxifying and soothing properties. Ayurveda recommends it as a daily post-lunch drink during summer. Sabja seeds, soaked in water, swell into a gel-like texture and are known to reduce body heat. Often used in sherbets and coolers, they aid digestion, reduce acidity, and act as natural body coolants. Crisp, hydrating, and alkaline, cucumber is one of the best summer vegetables. Ayurveda classifies it as a cooling food that soothes the stomach, hydrates cells, and helps eliminate toxins. It's ideal as a salad or juice ingredient. Pudina is a classic cooling herb that stimulates digestion, clears nasal congestion, and brings down internal heat.

https://doctor.ndtv.com/living-healthy/how-to-purify-water-for-drinking-and-safe-usage-8338095,How To Purify Water For Drinking And Safe Usage,"Updated: May 5, 2025 10:19 IST","Access to clean drinking water is essential for maintaining good health and preventing waterborne diseases. Yet, millions across the world, including in parts of India, rely on sources that may be contaminated with bacteria, viruses, parasites, or harmful chemicals. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), unsafe drinking water contributes to over half a million diarrhoeal deaths each year. Ensuring water is properly purified before consumption is vital for safe usage, especially during monsoons or in areas with poor sanitation. Here's a comprehensive guide to simple and effective water purification methods you can use at home or during emergencies. Contaminated water can cause diseases like cholera, typhoid, dysentery, and hepatitis A. Even clear-looking water may harbour invisible pathogens or chemicals. Purification removes or kills these harmful agents, making water safe for drinking, cooking, and hygiene. Whether you're using municipal supplies, wells, or stored tank water, purification ensures health protection for you and your family. Over time, regular laughter can reduce stress, support mental clarity, and improve immune response, making it a valuable and natural form of daily self-care. According to the National Eating Disorders Association (NEDA), orthorexia often involves rigid rules, food-related anxiety, and social isolation. Boiling water for at least 1–3 minutes kills most bacteria, viruses, and parasites. It's an ideal method during emergencies or when you suspect contamination. Let it cool naturally and store in a clean, covered container. WHO recommends boiling as a reliable household water treatment. Modern water purifiers use Reverse Osmosis (RO), Ultraviolet (UV), or Ultrafiltration (UF) technologies. RO filters out heavy metals, chemicals, and dissolved salts. UV kills microorganisms by destroying their DNA. UF removes bacteria and some viruses but doesn't eliminate dissolved salts. Choose a purifier based on your water source, groundwater, borewell, or municipal supply. Chlorine is a powerful disinfectant used by civic bodies to treat water. At home, you can use chlorine tablets (as per instructions) for stored water in emergencies. It's especially useful during floods or natural disasters. However, avoid overuse and ensure proper dosage to prevent side effects. In rural or resource-limited areas, solar disinfection can be a lifesaver. Fill transparent plastic bottles with water and leave them in direct sunlight for 6-8 hours. UV-A rays and heat work together to kill pathogens. This method is endorsed by WHO and is low-cost and sustainable. Ceramic filters or gravity-based filters are good non-electric options. They trap bacteria and sediments through microporous membranes. Some models also include activated carbon to improve taste and remove odour. They're ideal for rural homes or areas with electricity issues. Activated carbon filters can reduce chlorine, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and improve taste. Though they don't kill pathogens, they are excellent when used in combination with other purification methods. Many household water filters use carbon as a secondary purification layer. Distillation involves boiling water and collecting the steam back as liquid, leaving most contaminants behind. It's effective for removing heavy metals like lead and arsenic but consumes more energy. It's a practical solution when dealing with chemical contamination. Purified water can get contaminated if not stored correctly. Always use clean, covered containers made of food-grade plastic, stainless steel, or glass. Avoid dipping unclean hands or utensils into the container. Wash storage vessels frequently to maintain hygiene. Safe water is the cornerstone of good health. While advanced purification systems are available, traditional methods like boiling or solar disinfection still play a vital role in emergencies or rural settings. Understanding and practising water purification at home ensures your family is shielded from waterborne illnesses. When in doubt, purify, and protect your health, one drop at a time.

https://doctor.ndtv.com/living-healthy/9-foods-to-add-to-your-dinner-if-you-have-gut-issues-8336547,9 Foods To Add To Your Dinner If You Have Gut Issues,"Updated: May 5, 2025 06:53 IST","Diet changes can significantly help reduce gut issues, and what we eat for dinner plays a crucial role in that. The gut is home to trillions of bacteria that influence digestion, immunity, inflammation, and even mental health. Poor food choices, especially at night, can lead to bloating, indigestion, acid reflux, or disrupted sleep. Choosing gut-friendly foods for dinner supports smoother digestion and allows the body to rest and repair the digestive tract overnight. In this article, we share a list of foods you can add to your dinner if you have gut issues.   Lightly steamed veggies like carrots, zucchini, spinach, and pumpkin are easier to digest than raw ones. Cooking breaks down fibre and makes nutrients more absorbable, while still providing essential vitamins and minerals. These vegetables are gentle on the stomach and help feed beneficial gut bacteria.  Ginger has natural anti-inflammatory and gas-relieving properties. Adding fresh ginger to soups, dals, or stir-fries during dinner can ease bloating, support digestion, and prevent nausea. It's especially helpful if you suffer from gas or slow digestion at night.  Rich in probiotics, plain yogurt helps replenish good bacteria in the gut. Including a small portion of unsweetened yogurt with dinner can aid digestion and support gut balance. It's best paired with cooked grains or fruits like banana or papaya for a soothing end to the meal.  This traditional Indian dish combines moong dal (yellow lentils) and rice, making it both light and nourishing. It's easy to digest and provides protein, fibre, and essential nutrients. When cooked with ghee and mild spices like cumin and turmeric, khichdi becomes a perfect gut-soothing dinner.  These are rich in fibre but low in fermentable sugars, making them easy on sensitive stomachs. Their natural sweetness and soft texture (when cooked) make them ideal for soups or stews, helping to soothe the gut lining and improve bowel movement.  Though usually eaten for breakfast, plain oatmeal can be a great dinner for those with digestive issues. It's full of soluble fibre, which helps form a gel-like consistency in the gut, slowing digestion and easing symptoms like diarrhoea or constipation. Add turmeric or cinnamon for extra gut benefits.  Sauerkraut, kimchi, or fermented carrots contain natural probiotics that support the gut microbiome. Adding just a spoonful to dinner can enhance digestion. However, if you're new to fermented foods, start small to avoid gas or bloating.  Bone broth is rich in gelatine and amino acids like glutamine that support the gut lining and reduce inflammation. Sipping warm bone broth with your meal can help repair leaky gut, soothe the stomach, and improve nutrient absorption.  Papaya contains an enzyme called papain, which aids protein digestion and prevents bloating. Having a few slices of ripe papaya after dinner or mixed into a salad can reduce heaviness and support smoother digestion before bedtime.   Fibre-rich, anti-inflammatory, and probiotic foods can nourish the gut microbiome, while avoiding heavy, greasy, or processed meals can reduce discomfort and promote better gut health over time.

https://doctor.ndtv.com/women-s-health/womens-health-struggling-with-utis-often-these-tips-can-help-8335863,Women's Health: Struggling With UTIs Often? These Tips Can Help,"Updated: May 5, 2025 05:26 IST","Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs) are infections that occur in any part of the urinary system, including the kidneys, ureters, bladder, or urethra. They are commonly caused by bacteria which can enter the urinary tract through the urethra and multiply in the bladder. UTIs are more common in women due to their shorter urethra, which makes it easier for bacteria to reach the bladder. Symptoms may include a strong urge to urinate, a burning sensation during urination, cloudy or strong-smelling urine, and pelvic pain. If left untreated, UTIs can lead to more serious kidney infections. Keep reading as we share tips to reduce your risk of UTIs.  Maintaining good hygiene, staying hydrated, and adopting healthy habits can significantly lower the chances of UTIs in women. Here are ten essential tips to reduce the risk of UTI in women. Let's delve into the causes, prevention strategies, and treatment options for UTIs during pregnancy, ensuring expectant mothers have the knowledge to protect their health.  Drinking plenty of water throughout the day helps flush bacteria out of the urinary tract before they can cause an infection. Aim for at least 8 glasses of water a day, and drink even more in hot weather or after exercise. Proper hydration also dilutes urine, reducing irritation during urination if bacteria are present.  Holding urine for long periods allows bacteria more time to grow in the bladder. Try to urinate every 3–4 hours, even if you don't feel a strong urge. Emptying the bladder regularly keeps it free from bacteria and helps maintain overall urinary health.  After using the toilet, always wipe from front to back to prevent bacteria from the anal area from entering the urethra. This is especially important for women because of the close proximity between the urethra and anus. This simple hygiene step significantly reduces the risk of transferring bacteria to the urinary tract.  Sexual activity can push bacteria toward the urethra. Urinating soon after intercourse helps flush out any bacteria that may have entered the urinary tract. It's also beneficial to clean the genital area gently before and after sex to lower the risk of infection.  Products like douches, scented sprays, or powders can irritate the urethra and disrupt the natural balance of bacteria in the genital area. Stick to mild, unscented soap and water for cleaning the external genital area, and avoid inserting any products into the vagina.  Tight clothes and non-breathable fabrics create a warm, moist environment that encourages bacterial growth. Wearing cotton underwear and loose-fitting pants or skirts improves airflow and reduces moisture, making it harder for bacteria to thrive.  Soaking in bathtubs, especially with bubble bath or bath oils, can irritate the urethra and increase the chance of infection. Showers are generally safer for the urinary tract. If you prefer baths, keep them short, avoid harsh products, and rinse well afterward.  Regular and gentle washing of the genital area helps prevent bacteria buildup. However, avoid over-washing or using antibacterial soaps, which can disrupt the natural flora and make infections more likely. During menstruation, change sanitary pads or tampons frequently to reduce bacterial growth.  If you experience frequent UTIs consult a healthcare provider. Staying proactive about your urinary health can prevent future infections and complications.   Disclaimer: This content including advice provides generic information only.

https://doctor.ndtv.com/living-healthy/can-laughter-boost-your-well-being-8338425,Can Laughter Boost Your Well-Being?,"Updated: May 5, 2025 10:52 IST","Laughter is often called the best medicine, and for good reason. Beyond being a spontaneous response to humour, laughter has scientifically proven benefits for physical and mental well-being. According to the Mayo Clinic and the American Psychological Association (APA), laughter can lower stress hormones, boost immunity, improve heart health, and even relieve pain. In a world increasingly filled with pressure and anxiety, a hearty laugh may be the simplest tool to restore balance. But is it just a mood booster, or does laughter have long-term health implications? Let's explore how your chuckles can be good for your health. Studies from the Mayo Clinic and National Institutes of Health (NIH) confirm that laughter stimulates multiple body systems. It enhances oxygen intake, stimulates the heart and lungs, and releases feel-good endorphins. Over time, regular laughter can reduce stress, support mental clarity, and improve immune response, making it a valuable and natural form of daily self-care. According to the National Eating Disorders Association (NEDA), orthorexia often involves rigid rules, food-related anxiety, and social isolation. The Ministry of AYUSHrecommends seasonal diets aligned with Ayurvedic principles for better health and wellness during extreme weather conditions. Laughter lowers levels of cortisol and adrenaline, hormones linked to stress. A study published in the journal Alternative Therapies in Health and Medicine found that participants who laughed regularly had significantly reduced stress levels. A good laugh increases your heart rate and improves blood circulation, similar to light exercise. According to the American Heart Association, laughter may improve blood vessel function and reduce the risk of heart disease. Laughter boosts the production of natural killer cells, antibodies, and infection-fighting T-cells, helping the body ward off illness more efficiently, as observed by research cited by the National Cancer Institute. Endorphins released during laughter act as natural painkillers. Patients with chronic pain have reported reduced discomfort and improved tolerance after regular exposure to humour therapy sessions. Laughter is linked to lower levels of anxiety and depression. It encourages a positive outlook, promotes relaxation, and increases resilience during emotional hardship. Cognitive-behavioural therapists often use humour as part of treatment to reframe negative thoughts. Laughing together strengthens bonds and builds trust among people. Whether it's through shared jokes or funny stories, laughter creates a sense of belonging, which is vital for emotional well-being. Some studies suggest that laughter before bedtime may improve sleep by reducing muscle tension and lowering stress levels, contributing to deeper, more restful sleep. Laughter brings people into the present moment, similar to meditation. It encourages us to let go of overthinking and simply enjoy the here and now, a practice that improves overall mental clarity and peace. Watch a comedy show, join a laughter yoga group, recall funny memories, or simply spend time with playful people. The key is intentionality, seek humour in daily life and don't take everything seriously. As per Laughter Yoga International, even simulated laughter offers similar health benefits, as the body responds to it the same way as genuine laughter. Laughter isn't just a spontaneous reaction; it's a scientifically supported health booster. It improves mood, strengthens the body, and brings people closer together. So the next time you feel overwhelmed or tired, take a humour break, because sometimes, a good laugh is all the therapy you need. Remember, the best medicine is free and already within you.

https://doctor.ndtv.com/living-healthy/9-foods-to-add-to-your-dinner-if-you-have-gut-issues-8336547,9 Foods To Add To Your Dinner If You Have Gut Issues,"Updated: May 5, 2025 06:53 IST","Diet changes can significantly help reduce gut issues, and what we eat for dinner plays a crucial role in that. The gut is home to trillions of bacteria that influence digestion, immunity, inflammation, and even mental health. Poor food choices, especially at night, can lead to bloating, indigestion, acid reflux, or disrupted sleep. Choosing gut-friendly foods for dinner supports smoother digestion and allows the body to rest and repair the digestive tract overnight. In this article, we share a list of foods you can add to your dinner if you have gut issues.   Lightly steamed veggies like carrots, zucchini, spinach, and pumpkin are easier to digest than raw ones. Cooking breaks down fibre and makes nutrients more absorbable, while still providing essential vitamins and minerals. These vegetables are gentle on the stomach and help feed beneficial gut bacteria.  Ginger has natural anti-inflammatory and gas-relieving properties. Adding fresh ginger to soups, dals, or stir-fries during dinner can ease bloating, support digestion, and prevent nausea. It's especially helpful if you suffer from gas or slow digestion at night.  Rich in probiotics, plain yogurt helps replenish good bacteria in the gut. Including a small portion of unsweetened yogurt with dinner can aid digestion and support gut balance. It's best paired with cooked grains or fruits like banana or papaya for a soothing end to the meal.  This traditional Indian dish combines moong dal (yellow lentils) and rice, making it both light and nourishing. It's easy to digest and provides protein, fibre, and essential nutrients. When cooked with ghee and mild spices like cumin and turmeric, khichdi becomes a perfect gut-soothing dinner.  These are rich in fibre but low in fermentable sugars, making them easy on sensitive stomachs. Their natural sweetness and soft texture (when cooked) make them ideal for soups or stews, helping to soothe the gut lining and improve bowel movement.  Though usually eaten for breakfast, plain oatmeal can be a great dinner for those with digestive issues. It's full of soluble fibre, which helps form a gel-like consistency in the gut, slowing digestion and easing symptoms like diarrhoea or constipation. Add turmeric or cinnamon for extra gut benefits.  Sauerkraut, kimchi, or fermented carrots contain natural probiotics that support the gut microbiome. Adding just a spoonful to dinner can enhance digestion. However, if you're new to fermented foods, start small to avoid gas or bloating.  Bone broth is rich in gelatine and amino acids like glutamine that support the gut lining and reduce inflammation. Sipping warm bone broth with your meal can help repair leaky gut, soothe the stomach, and improve nutrient absorption.  Papaya contains an enzyme called papain, which aids protein digestion and prevents bloating. Having a few slices of ripe papaya after dinner or mixed into a salad can reduce heaviness and support smoother digestion before bedtime.   Fibre-rich, anti-inflammatory, and probiotic foods can nourish the gut microbiome, while avoiding heavy, greasy, or processed meals can reduce discomfort and promote better gut health over time.

https://doctor.ndtv.com/women-s-health/womens-health-struggling-with-utis-often-these-tips-can-help-8335863,Women's Health: Struggling With UTIs Often? These Tips Can Help,"Updated: May 5, 2025 05:26 IST","Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs) are infections that occur in any part of the urinary system, including the kidneys, ureters, bladder, or urethra. They are commonly caused by bacteria which can enter the urinary tract through the urethra and multiply in the bladder. UTIs are more common in women due to their shorter urethra, which makes it easier for bacteria to reach the bladder. Symptoms may include a strong urge to urinate, a burning sensation during urination, cloudy or strong-smelling urine, and pelvic pain. If left untreated, UTIs can lead to more serious kidney infections. Keep reading as we share tips to reduce your risk of UTIs.  Maintaining good hygiene, staying hydrated, and adopting healthy habits can significantly lower the chances of UTIs in women. Here are ten essential tips to reduce the risk of UTI in women. Let's delve into the causes, prevention strategies, and treatment options for UTIs during pregnancy, ensuring expectant mothers have the knowledge to protect their health.  Drinking plenty of water throughout the day helps flush bacteria out of the urinary tract before they can cause an infection. Aim for at least 8 glasses of water a day, and drink even more in hot weather or after exercise. Proper hydration also dilutes urine, reducing irritation during urination if bacteria are present.  Holding urine for long periods allows bacteria more time to grow in the bladder. Try to urinate every 3–4 hours, even if you don't feel a strong urge. Emptying the bladder regularly keeps it free from bacteria and helps maintain overall urinary health.  After using the toilet, always wipe from front to back to prevent bacteria from the anal area from entering the urethra. This is especially important for women because of the close proximity between the urethra and anus. This simple hygiene step significantly reduces the risk of transferring bacteria to the urinary tract.  Sexual activity can push bacteria toward the urethra. Urinating soon after intercourse helps flush out any bacteria that may have entered the urinary tract. It's also beneficial to clean the genital area gently before and after sex to lower the risk of infection.  Products like douches, scented sprays, or powders can irritate the urethra and disrupt the natural balance of bacteria in the genital area. Stick to mild, unscented soap and water for cleaning the external genital area, and avoid inserting any products into the vagina.  Tight clothes and non-breathable fabrics create a warm, moist environment that encourages bacterial growth. Wearing cotton underwear and loose-fitting pants or skirts improves airflow and reduces moisture, making it harder for bacteria to thrive.  Soaking in bathtubs, especially with bubble bath or bath oils, can irritate the urethra and increase the chance of infection. Showers are generally safer for the urinary tract. If you prefer baths, keep them short, avoid harsh products, and rinse well afterward.  Regular and gentle washing of the genital area helps prevent bacteria buildup. However, avoid over-washing or using antibacterial soaps, which can disrupt the natural flora and make infections more likely. During menstruation, change sanitary pads or tampons frequently to reduce bacterial growth.  If you experience frequent UTIs consult a healthcare provider. Staying proactive about your urinary health can prevent future infections and complications.   Disclaimer: This content including advice provides generic information only.

https://doctor.ndtv.com/women-s-health/bowl-issues-during-periods-these-tips-can-help-8853026,Bowl Issues During Periods? These Tips Can Help,"Updated: Jul 10, 2025 11:51 IST","Bowel issues during periods are quite common due to hormonal changes, especially fluctuating levels of prostaglandins and progesterone. These hormones can affect digestion and bowel movement patterns, leading to symptoms like diarrhoea, constipation, bloating, or abdominal cramping. Prostaglandins can stimulate muscle contractions in the intestines, resulting in looser stools, while a drop in progesterone may slow digestion, causing constipation. While these symptoms are usually harmless, they can be uncomfortable. Fortunately, some simple dietary and lifestyle tips can help ease bowel-related issues during menstruation. In this article, we outline a list of tips that can help minimise bowel issues one might experience during their periods.  Conditions like endometriosis, fibroids, or pelvic inflammatory disease may cause intense menstrual pain and require medical attention. Below we discuss common causes. Steering clear of certain foods, habits, or activities can help reduce these symptoms, stabilise energy levels, and support your bodys natural rhythm.  Drinking plenty of water helps prevent constipation and supports healthy digestion. It can also reduce bloating by flushing out excess sodium and aiding smooth bowel movement.  Fibre-rich foods like oats, whole grains, fruits, and vegetables can help regulate your bowel movements. Soluble fibre eases diarrhoea by absorbing excess water, while insoluble fibre combats constipation.  Caffeine can stimulate the bowels too much, worsening diarrhoea, while sugary drinks can cause bloating and gas. Reducing these during your period can help stabilise your digestion.  Some people become temporarily more lactose intolerant during their period. If dairy makes you gassy or bloated, consider skipping it to ease bowel discomfort.  Foods like yogurt, kefir, or fermented vegetables support healthy gut bacteria, which can help balance digestion and reduce cramping or irregular bowel habits.  Gentle exercise, like walking or yoga, stimulates digestion and reduces bloating and constipation. It also helps with overall period pain and mood regulation.  Instead of heavy meals, try eating lighter meals more often. This helps your digestive system cope better and can prevent bloating or sudden bowel urgency.  These can irritate the stomach and speed up digestion, increasing the chances of diarrhoea or stomach cramps. Stick to easily digestible meals during your period.  A warm compress or heating pad not only relieves cramps but can also relax your intestinal muscles, easing bowel movements and abdominal discomfort.  Keep a journal of your bowel habits and diet during your cycle. This can help you identify patterns or food triggers and make it easier to adjust your routine accordingly.  Follow these tips today to overcome bowel issues during periods.  Disclaimer: This content including advice provides generic information only.

https://doctor.ndtv.com/living-healthy/kidney-stones-these-foods-might-be-an-enemy-8849753,Kidney Stones? These Foods Might Be An Enemy,"Updated: Jul 9, 2025 06:33 IST","Kidney stones are hard mineral and salt deposits that form in the kidneys when urine becomes too concentrated, allowing these substances to crystallise and stick together. They can vary in size and cause severe pain, especially when passing through the urinary tract. While genetics, dehydration, and certain health conditions contribute to their formation, diet plays a major role too. Some foods can increase levels of oxalate, calcium, uric acid, or sodium in the urine, compounds that can contribute to kidney stone formation. Being aware of these ""enemy"" foods can help those prone to stones prevent recurrence and protect their kidney health. In this article, we share foods to avoid if you have kidney stones.  Kidney stones can cause severe pain and discomfort. Several diet modifications can help in controlling the risk of kidney stones. Here are some foods you must avoid. Kidney stones: A diet high in protein and salt can lead to formation of kidney stones. Read here to know foods to eat and avoid for preventing kidney stones.  Spinach is high in oxalates, which bind with calcium in the kidneys to form calcium oxalate stones, the most common type. While it's nutritious, consuming large amounts can raise the risk, especially when not balanced with calcium-rich foods.  Like spinach, beets contain high oxalate levels. People who are prone to calcium oxalate stones should limit beetroot and beet juice, as regular consumption can significantly increase oxalate buildup in urine.  Although healthy in moderation, nuts like almonds, cashews, and peanuts are oxalate-rich. For those with a history of kidney stones, consuming these in excess may worsen the risk of recurrence.  Dark chocolate and cocoa are surprisingly high in oxalates. While small amounts occasionally may be fine, regular or excessive consumption can be problematic for people susceptible to kidney stones.  Black tea is another oxalate-heavy beverage. Drinking too much especially without enough water can raise oxalate levels and contribute to stone formation. Herbal teas with lower oxalate content can be better alternatives.  Red meat is high in purines, which can increase uric acid levels in the body. Excessive uric acid can lead to uric acid stones. Cutting back on animal protein can help prevent these types of stones from forming.  High-sodium diets cause calcium to be excreted more in the urine, promoting calcium stone formation. Canned soups, chips, fast food, and other salty snacks are best minimised for kidney health.  Cola contains phosphoric acid, which may contribute to stone formation. Sugary sodas and beverages can also increase uric acid and reduce urine volume, both risk factors for kidney stones.  This vegetable is another oxalate-rich food that can spike levels in the urine. Its sharp sourness is matched by its strong effect on kidney stone formation in sensitive individuals.  High doses of vitamin C can be metabolised into oxalate in the body. Regular intake of large amounts may raise the risk of oxalate stones and should be avoided without medical guidance.  For individuals prone to kidney stones, understanding these dietary triggers is crucial. Staying hydrated, balancing intake of calcium and oxalates, and reducing salt and animal protein can go a long way in preventing painful stone episodes.

https://doctor.ndtv.com/living-healthy/importance-of-proper-sleep-routine-in-teens-8848018,Importance Of Proper Sleep Routine In Teens,"Updated: Jul 9, 2025 02:27 IST","A consistent sleep routine is essential for good health, particularly for teenagers. During adolescence, the body undergoes significant physical, emotional, and mental changes, all of which are supported by adequate rest. However, due to academic pressures, screen time, and hormonal shifts, teens often experience irregular sleep patterns or sleep deprivation. A proper sleep routine helps regulate the body's internal clock, improves mood, supports brain development, and boosts overall well-being. For teens, maintaining a consistent sleep-wake cycle can enhance focus, emotional regulation, and even physical growth. Keep reading as we discuss why a proper sleep routine is important in teens.   Teenagers experience rapid physical growth, and most of this growth happens during deep sleep when growth hormone is released. A consistent sleep routine ensures that teens get enough of this deep sleep, supporting healthy development of bones, muscles, and tissues.  Sleep directly impacts cognitive functions like memory, focus, and problem-solving. Teens with a consistent sleep schedule tend to perform better academically because their brain gets the rest it needs to process and retain information effectively.  Lack of sleep is linked to mood swings, irritability, and even anxiety and depression. A proper sleep routine helps stabilise emotions and boosts mental resilience, which is especially important for teens navigating social and emotional changes.  Sleep strengthens the immune system by allowing the body to repair and fight off infections. During monsoon and seasonal shifts, when teens are more prone to getting sick, a consistent sleep routine helps in keeping their immunity strong.  Irregular sleep patterns can disrupt the balance of hunger hormones, leading to poor food choices and overeating. Teens who sleep well are more likely to maintain a healthy weight and have better control over their appetite.  Teenagers are often affected by acne and other skin issues. Quality sleep allows for skin regeneration and reduces inflammation, making a consistent sleep routine a natural skincare aid.  Sleep recharges the body. Teens involved in sports or physical activities need regular, quality sleep for muscle recovery, endurance, and energy. It directly affects their athletic and daily performance.  Sleep is crucial for maintaining hormonal balance, especially during puberty. Disrupted sleep can affect hormones like melatonin, cortisol, and insulin, potentially impacting mood, growth, and even metabolism.  Teens are known for impulsive behaviour, and sleep deprivation worsens this by impairing judgment and risk assessment. A regular sleep pattern promotes clearer thinking and better decision-making.  Developing a sleep routine during the teenage years creates a strong foundation for long-term health. It instills discipline, improves time management, and sets the tone for a healthier adult lifestyle.  Adopt a healthy sleep routine to boost your health today.

https://doctor.ndtv.com/cancer/10-foods-to-reduce-risk-of-colon-cancer-8843949,10 Foods To Reduce Risk Of Colon Cancer,"Updated: Jul 8, 2025 06:55 IST","Colon cancer, also known as colorectal cancer, is a type of cancer that starts in the large intestine (colon) or rectum. It often begins as small, noncancerous clumps of cells called polyps that can develop into cancer over time. Common risk factors include age, family history, sedentary lifestyle, obesity, smoking, alcohol consumption, and a diet low in fibre and high in red or processed meats. Fortunately, certain dietary choices can play a key role in reducing the risk of colon cancer. Keep reading as we share a list of foods you can have to reduce risk of colon cancer.  Below we share a list of fibre-rich foods you can add to your diet to reduce the risk of colon cancer. Nutritionist Lovneet Batra throws light on certain health benefits of whole grains.  These are rich in fibre, folate, and antioxidants like lutein and carotenoids. They help flush out toxins, reduce inflammation in the colon, and support regular bowel movements, which lower the chances of polyps and cancer formation.  These vegetables contain sulforaphane, a plant compound known for its cancer-fighting properties. Studies show that these veggies can inhibit the growth of cancer cells and detoxify the body of harmful carcinogens.  Whole grains are packed with dietary fibre, which adds bulk to stool and promotes faster elimination of waste, reducing the contact time of potential carcinogens with the colon lining. They also improve gut health and reduce inflammation.  Rich in resistant starch and soluble fibre, legumes help nourish beneficial gut bacteria. This process produces short-chain fatty acids that have anti-cancer properties and reduce inflammation in the colon.  Berries are loaded with powerful antioxidants such as anthocyanins, ellagic acid, and vitamin C. These compounds help protect colon cells from oxidative stress and DNA damage that could lead to cancer.  Omega-3 fatty acids in fatty fish have been linked to lower levels of inflammation in the body. Regular consumption of omega-3-rich fish may help reduce the risk of colon cancer by decreasing the inflammatory response in the digestive tract.  Garlic contains sulphur compounds that activate liver enzymes to destroy carcinogens. Its antibacterial properties also support gut health and may reduce the formation of cancer-causing substances in the colon.  Curcumin, the active compound in turmeric, has strong anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. It may slow the growth of cancer cells and prevent the spread of tumours, making it a valuable addition to a colon-friendly diet.  Probiotics promote a healthy gut microbiome, which plays a major role in immune defence and inflammation control. Regular intake of yogurt with live cultures can help maintain digestive balance and lower the risk of colon issues.  Nuts provide fibre, healthy fats, and antioxidants like selenium and vitamin E. These nutrients combat oxidative stress and support colon health. Moderate consumption of nuts has been linked to a reduced risk of colorectal cancer.  Foods rich in fibre, antioxidants, and anti-inflammatory properties help maintain digestive health, support the gut microbiome, and may prevent the development of cancerous cells in the colon.

While pets offer companionship and health benefits, they can also carry bacteria, viruses, parasites, or fungi that may spread to people. The risk increases with poor hygiene, weakened immune systems, or lack of preventive pet care. However, most pet-related infections are preventable with proper pet handling, regular vet visits, cleanliness, and good personal hygiene. Keep reading as we discuss some diseases you can catch from your pets and how to avoid them.   A fungal infection that affects the skin, scalp, or nails. Pets like cats and dogs can carry it and transmit it through direct contact. Regularly bathe and groom pets. Disinfect areas your pet frequently visits. Avoid touching animals with bald patches or lesions. Always wash your hands after petting or handling pets.  Toxoplasmosis is caused by a parasite found in cat faeces. It's especially risky for pregnant women and those with weak immune systems. Clean the litter box daily while wearing gloves (preferably someone else should do it during pregnancy), and wash hands thoroughly afterward. Avoid undercooked meat, another source of the parasite.  A bacterial infection caused by Bartonella henselae, usually spread through scratches or bites from infected cats. Avoid rough play with cats, especially kittens. Clean scratches or bites immediately with soap and water. Keep cats indoors and flea-free.  Caused by Salmonella bacteria, which can be transmitted through handling reptiles, birds, or contaminated pet food (especially raw diets). Always wash your hands after touching pets or their food. Keep reptiles away from kitchens and children under 5. Avoid feeding pets raw meat without veterinary advice.  A bacterial infection often spread through the urine of infected dogs or wild animals. Humans can contract it through contaminated water or soil. Vaccinate your dog, avoid walking them in floodwaters or muddy areas, and wear gloves when cleaning up pet urine or waste.  A bacterial infection that causes diarrhoea in humans, often transmitted by handling puppies or kittens with diarrhoea. Practice good hygiene when cleaning up after pets. Wash hands after pet contact, especially before eating or cooking.  A deadly virus transmitted through bites from infected animals. It affects the nervous system and is almost always fatal once symptoms appear. Ensure pets are vaccinated against rabies. Avoid contact with stray or wild animals. Seek immediate medical care if bitten or scratched.  These parasites live in the intestines of pets and can be passed to humans through faeces-contaminated soil or pet fur. They can cause skin infections or more serious internal issues. Deworm pets regularly. Promptly clean up pet faeces. Teach children not to play in areas where pets relieve themselves, and ensure they wash their hands afterward.  Regular veterinary checkups, proper pet hygiene, clean surroundings, and awareness are your best tools to enjoy a safe, healthy bond with your furry (or feathery or scaly) friend.

https://doctor.ndtv.com/living-healthy/incorporate-these-ayurvedic-hacks-this-monsoon-to-avoid-seasonal-ailments-8837345,Incorporate These Ayurvedic Hacks This Monsoon To Avoid Seasonal Ailments,"Updated: Jul 7, 2025 04:51 IST","Ayurvedic hacks can be highly effective in preventing seasonal ailments during the monsoon. According to Ayurveda, the rainy season aggravates the Vata and Kapha doshas while weakening Agni (digestive fire), making the body more prone to infections, indigestion, respiratory issues, and joint pain. Ayurveda recommends natural, holistic practices using herbs, spices, diet, and daily routines to balance these doshas, boost immunity, and protect against common monsoon ailments like colds, coughs, fevers, skin infections, and digestive problems. Read on as we share Ayurvedic hacks to help avoid ailments this monsoon.   Drinking warm water infused with ginger or tulsi leaves first thing in the morning helps kindle digestive fire (Agni), flush out toxins, and prevent throat infections. It strengthens the respiratory system and prepares your gut for the day ahead.  Triphala, a mix of amla, haritaki, and bibhitaki helps cleanse the digestive system, prevent constipation, and boost immunity. Consuming it at night with warm water keeps your gut clean and strengthens your overall resistance to infections.  Performing a warm oil massage using sesame oil (or medicated oils like Narayana Tailam) helps calm aggravated Vata, nourishes the skin, lubricates the joints, and improves blood circulation. It also acts as a barrier against skin infections caused by dampness.  Ayurveda advises adding spices like cumin, black pepper, turmeric, ajwain, and asafoetida (hing) to your monsoon meals. These enhance digestion, reduce bloating, and prevent foodborne infections, common during the humid season.  Raw greens can harbour bacteria and worsen digestion during monsoon. Instead, opt for warm, cooked, easy-to-digest foods like khichdi, soups, and steamed vegetables. This helps maintain a balanced Agni and prevents gastrointestinal issues.  Sipping herbal teas made with ingredients like tulsi, cinnamon, cardamom, or mulethi (licorice) helps fight off colds, maintain respiratory health, and keeps the body warm and light. These teas are also calming and support immunity.  Day sleeping during monsoon can increase Kapha accumulation, slowing down metabolism and inviting lethargy, cold, and cough. Ayurveda suggests staying active during the day and resting well at night to maintain natural body rhythms.  Burning camphor or Ayurvedic herbs like sambrani in the home helps purify the air, kill germs, and uplift the mood. It also prevents mould and damp-related respiratory discomfort that are common in monsoon months.  Mixing a pinch of turmeric in a spoon of honey and consuming it in the morning can strengthen your immune response. Both ingredients are natural antibiotics and help fight inflammation, throat irritation, and viral infections.  Cold, oily, or deep-fried foods aggravate Kapha and dampen digestive fire, leading to sluggish digestion, colds, and sore throats. Stick to freshly cooked, warm meals with minimal oil to stay light and energised.  Incorporating simple, time-tested Ayurvedic hacks can help keep the body strong, the mind calm, and the immune system resilient throughout the damp season.

https://doctor.ndtv.com/heart/can-oral-health-issues-signal-heart-problems-8836721,Can Oral Health Issues Signal Heart Problems?,"Updated: Jul 7, 2025 03:03 IST","Oral health issues can be early warning signs of heart problems. Research has increasingly shown a strong link between poor oral hygiene and cardiovascular conditions such as heart disease, clogged arteries, and stroke. The connection lies in inflammation, bacteria from infected gums can enter the bloodstream, triggering inflammation in blood vessels and increasing the risk of plaque buildup in the arteries. Read on as we share a list of oral health issues that could signify heart issues.   Chronic gum inflammation, especially periodontitis, is closely linked with heart disease. The same bacteria causing gum disease can enter the bloodstream, contribute to arterial plaque buildup, and increase the risk of heart attack or stroke. If your gums are swollen, red, or bleeding frequently, it may signal both oral and cardiovascular inflammation.  While often caused by poor oral hygiene or food, persistent bad breath can also result from gum disease or oral infections, both of which are connected to cardiovascular health risks. The sulfur-producing bacteria involved in halitosis may also increase systemic inflammation affecting the heart.  Losing adult teeth without physical trauma may indicate advanced gum disease, which can be a predictor of heart issues. The inflammation and bone loss causing tooth mobility often reflect underlying systemic inflammation, which may also be harming the arteries.  Frequent gum bleeding, especially during brushing or flossing, is an early sign of gingivitis or periodontitis. This chronic inflammation can contribute to atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries) by increasing inflammatory markers in the blood.  Recurrent sores or pus-filled abscesses in the mouth could point to uncontrolled infection. When these infections become systemic, they can trigger an immune response that raises your heart disease risk by affecting blood vessel function.  Saliva protects the mouth from harmful bacteria. Persistent dry mouth can lead to an imbalance of bacteria, promoting tooth decay and gum disease. This bacterial imbalance and subsequent inflammation can have ripple effects on heart health, particularly in people with existing cardiovascular conditions.  Gum recession exposes the roots of teeth and often accompanies periodontitis. It's a physical sign of tissue breakdown due to inflammation, which, when systemic, is a known contributor to heart disease.  Pain in the jaw, especially radiating to the left, can sometimes mimic dental issues but may actually signal angina (restricted blood flow to the heart) or an impending heart attack. If not linked to any dental issue, this kind of pain should be evaluated urgently.  Untreated tooth infections can lead to bacteria entering the bloodstream and causing endocarditis, an infection of the heart lining. Chronic infections may also cause inflammation throughout the body, putting additional stress on cardiovascular systems.  An unusually pale or bluish tongue can indicate poor circulation, possibly linked to heart issues. While not specific to oral disease, such symptoms, especially if paired with fatigue or chest discomfort, should not be ignored as they may reflect reduced oxygenated blood flow from a weakened heart.  Therefore, symptoms like persistent gum bleeding, bad breath, or tooth infections shouldn't be ignored, as they may reflect deeper systemic issues, including potential heart complications.

The path to spiritual enlightenment is often paved with good intentions, but what happens when the pursuit of higher consciousness becomes a tool for arrogance? When spiritual practices and teachings are used to fuel the ego rather than transcend it, spiritual narcissism can take root. This phenomenon can be both captivating and toxic, leaving those around them feeling drained, confused, and even spiritually wounded. In a post shared on Instagram, fitness coach Luke Coutinho explained the meaning of spiritual narcissism. He wrote, ""A spiritual narcissist is someone who uses spiritual or religious beliefs and practices to boost their ego, gain power, control, or admiration, and often to feel superior to others. Unlike genuine spirituality, which emphasises humility, empathy, and connection, spiritual narcissism is marked by self-centeredness disguised as enlightenment.""

It's a practical, low-cost, and highly effective way to improve your overall well-being. Here's why you should consider pedalling more often. The fitness coach added that spiritual narcissism is not the same as narcissistic personality disorder (NPD), which is a clinical diagnosis. It is rather a ""pattern of behaviour that can occur in anyone, especially in spiritual or religious contexts.""

They act as if they are more spiritually advanced, looking down on others who don't share their beliefs or practices. For example, they might criticise you for not following their specific spiritual diet or meditation routine, claiming it's essential for health or enlightenment. 2. Attention-seeking behaviour
They constantly highlight their spiritual achievements (e.g., posting about meditation retreats or spiritual experiences on social media) to gain admiration. They may dominate spiritual gatherings, needing to be the centre of attention. 3. Lack of empathy masked as detachment
They dismiss others' emotions, telling them to “let go” or “rise above” feelings. They show little genuine compassion instead of offering understanding and support. 4. Manipulation using spiritual language
They use spiritual jargon or concepts to control or justify harmful actions, such as shaming others for not following their advice or claiming divine authority. 5. Hypocrisy and resistance to accountability
They preach humility or compassion but act arrogantly and reject criticism. They may get defensive or angry when challenged spiritually, claiming their spiritual status exempts them. What can you do? 1. Limit interactions and clearly communicate what is acceptable. Be firm yet respectful. 
2. Stay calm and avoid reacting to their provocations or attempts to make you feel inferior. Focus on your own path and your beliefs, taking advice from those who respect and understand you.
3. Seek support, trust your instincts and avoid vulnerable settings. Be cautious in spiritual or wellness groups where narcissists may exploit seekers. 
4. Never allow a spiritual narcissist to demean or control, manipulate you in a relationship, work, business or love. Keep these pointers in mind to stray clear of spiritual narcissists.

Look Out For These Symptoms,"Updated: Jul 4, 2025 03:27 IST","Lactose intolerance is a common digestive condition where the body is unable to fully digest lactose, the natural sugar found in milk and dairy products. This occurs when the small intestine doesn't produce enough of the enzyme lactase, which is needed to break down lactose. As a result, undigested lactose ferments in the colon, causing uncomfortable symptoms. If someone is unsure whether they have lactose intolerance, certain symptoms especially after consuming dairy, can serve as helpful indicators. Recognising and tracking these symptoms can assist in identifying the condition and guiding dietary changes or seeking medical advice. Keep reading as we discuss signs that might indicate you have lactose intolerance.  These alternatives cater not only to those with lactose intolerance but also to those seeking vegan, plant-based options or those with dairy allergies. Lets explore eight great milk alternatives that can easily replace cows milk in your diet. Nutritionist Lovneet Batra highlights three important things that you must know while buying dairy.  One of the most common signs of lactose intolerance is abdominal bloating. After consuming milk or dairy, you might notice your stomach feeling full, tight, or swollen. This is due to the fermentation of undigested lactose in the colon, which produces gas and discomfort.  Frequent loose stools shortly after eating dairy products may point to lactose intolerance. Since the body can't break down lactose properly, it pulls water into the intestines, resulting in watery bowel movements.  Cramping or sharp abdominal pain often follows dairy consumption in people with lactose intolerance. These cramps can range from mild to severe and usually appear within 30 minutes to two hours of eating or drinking dairy.  Flatulence is a common but often embarrassing symptom. The buildup of hydrogen and other gases during lactose fermentation in the colon can cause increased gas, leading to pressure, discomfort, and sometimes audible symptoms.  Feeling nauseated after consuming dairy could indicate lactose intolerance. In some cases, individuals might even feel close to vomiting, especially when large amounts of lactose are consumed on an empty stomach.  Hyperactive bowel sounds or gurgling noises, especially after eating dairy, are caused by excessive gas and fluid in the intestines, signalling digestive distress associated with lactose intolerance.  An urgent need to go to the bathroom soon after consuming dairy could be a red flag. The combination of cramping, bloating, and diarrhoea often creates an intense, immediate need for a bowel movement.  Though less common, some people with lactose intolerance experience constipation instead of diarrhoea. The altered digestion and gut motility from incomplete lactose breakdown can slow down bowel movements for some.  Some people report feeling unusually tired or mentally foggy after dairy consumption. While not a classic digestive symptom, this may be linked to systemic inflammation or a body-wide response to the gut imbalance.  Although not always directly caused by lactose intolerance, skin issues like acne, rashes, or eczema-like symptoms sometimes flare up in people who react poorly to dairy. These signs might indicate inflammation linked to poor lactose digestion or a dairy sensitivity.  If you notice a consistent pattern of these symptoms after eating dairy, it's wise to consult a healthcare provider or try a short-term dairy elimination followed by a reintroduction to see if symptoms reappear.

https://doctor.ndtv.com/children/10-tips-intelligent-students-use-to-score-well-8823357,10 Tips Intelligent Students Use To Score Well,"Updated: Jul 4, 2025 01:02 IST","Intelligent students often follow a set of smart strategies that go beyond just studying hard they study smart. These methods are rooted in understanding how to manage time, focus deeply, and retain information effectively. Tips such as active recall, spaced repetition, proper sleep, and strategic revision schedules are scientifically proven to improve learning outcomes. These habits not only help in mastering subjects efficiently but also reduce stress and boost confidence, ultimately leading to better exam performance. In this article, we share a list of tips intelligent students use to score well.   Top students begin preparing well before exams. They break the syllabus into manageable chunks and create a study calendar. Early preparation allows time to revisit difficult topics and reduces last-minute panic, improving retention and confidence.  Instead of passive reading, they test themselves frequently using flashcards, practice questions, or by explaining concepts aloud. This technique strengthens memory and highlights areas that need more attention.  Smart learners don't cram. They revisit material at increasing intervals using tools like Anki or spaced revision apps. This method taps into the brain's natural forgetting curve to reinforce long-term memory.  Rather than memorising blindly, intelligent students aim to understand core concepts. This helps them apply knowledge to a variety of questions, including tricky or analytical ones that test comprehension.  Solving previous years' papers and sample questions helps in familiarising with exam patterns and time constraints. It also identifies weak areas and boosts exam-taking confidence.  They study in focused 25-minute intervals followed by short breaks. This keeps their mind fresh and focused, enhances productivity, and prevents mental fatigue.  Smart students revise regularly, not just before exams. Weekly reviews help reinforce key ideas and prevent the buildup of forgotten material, ensuring they're always exam-ready.  They prioritise sleep, hydration, and balanced meals. Adequate rest sharpens memory, improves concentration, and supports better problem-solving during exams.  They create distraction-free environments and use digital tools like noise-cancelling headphones, study apps, or timers. This promotes deeper concentration and helps maintain study discipline.  Intelligent students develop a growth mindset and practice stress-reducing habits like journaling, deep breathing, or light exercise. Staying calm under pressure enhances focus and improves exam performance.  By combining these smart techniques with consistent effort, students not only score higher but also retain knowledge more meaningfully, which benefits them well beyond exams.

These Foods Will Provide Instant Relief,"Updated: Jul 3, 2025 10:05 IST"," Constipation is a common digestive concern characterised by infrequent bowel movements or difficulty passing stools. Constipation can cause discomfort, bloating, gas and cramps. Various factors can contribute to constipation, including dehydration, low fibre intake, lack of physical activity, certain medications, and medical conditions. Understanding the underlying causes is essential for effective management. One of the most immediate ways to alleviate constipation is through dietary changes. Certain foods, particularly those with high fibre content can promote bowel regularity and provide quick relief. Here, we have some foods that can help you relieve constipation effectively. In this article, we explore the best foods that can help relieve constipation naturally and promote a healthy digestive system. Since digestion slows down during sleep, adopting healthy habits before bedtime can help stimulate bowel movements the next morning. High-fibre foods promote healthy digestion, add bulk to the stool and promote bowel regularity. Vegetables like broccoli, carrots, and Brussels sprouts are great choices. Fruits such as apples, pears, and berries are also rich in fibre, particularly when consumed with the skin. Beans and legumes, including lentils, chickpeas, and black beans, are also excellent sources of soluble fibre. Whole grain products like oats, brown rice, and whole grain bread contain fibre. They may help enhance the bulk of the stool and stimulate bowel movement. Some fruits contain mild laxative properties like prunes and dried plums. They contain sorbitol, a sugar alcohol that attracts water into the intestines, promoting easier bowel movements. Additionally, figs and kiwi can also help due to their high fibre content and natural enzymes. Almonds, walnuts, flaxseeds and chia seeds are rich in fibre and healthy fats. Including a handful of nuts or a mix of seeds in your diet to support healthy digestion. Drinking enough water helps prevent and relieve constipation. Staying hydrated helps soften the stool, making it easier to pass. Herbal teas, particularly those containing ginger or peppermint, can also aid digestion. In addition to these dietary tips, exercising regularly helps promote digestion and stimulates digestive function. Disclaimer: This content including advice provides generic information only.

Let's Separate Facts From Fiction","Updated: Jul 3, 2025 05:05 IST","The idea that walking 10,000 steps a day is the golden standard for health has become widely popular, but it's not entirely rooted in science. Originally stemming from a 1960s Japanese marketing campaign, the 10,000-step goal was more of a catchy slogan than a scientifically proven benchmark. While walking 10,000 steps can definitely improve cardiovascular health, aid weight management, and enhance mood, it may not be necessary or appropriate for everyone. Some people may benefit from fewer steps with higher intensity, while others may need more depending on their fitness goals. Read on as we discuss the common facts and myths surrounding walking 10,000 steps.  This article delves into the ten leading causes of death in India, providing insights into each and highlighting the importance of addressing these health concerns. Yoga Poses For Winter Mornings: In this article, we'll explore ten yoga poses to do every winter morning, helping you stay fit and mentally rejuvenated throughout the winter season.  The 10,000-step goal isn't a one-size-fits-all requirement. People with different ages, lifestyles, and health conditions might need more or fewer steps to maintain or improve health. Some studies show benefits even with 6,000–8,000 steps, especially in older adults.  Regular walking whether it's 6,000, 8,000, or 10,000 steps, can lower the risk of heart disease, diabetes, and certain cancers. It also improves blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and insulin sensitivity over time.  You don't need to walk all 10,000 steps in a single session. Accumulating steps throughout the day like using stairs, taking short walks, or pacing during calls, has the same health benefits when spread out.  Daily steps, regardless of the exact number, are linked to better mood, reduced anxiety, and improved cognitive function. Even brief walks during a stressful day can positively impact mental well-being.  While step count is useful, intensity also matters. A brisk 30-minute walk can have more cardiovascular benefits than a slow-paced 10,000 steps. Including moderate to vigorous movement improves heart and lung health more effectively.  Studies show that walking just 7,000–8,000 steps per day can significantly lower mortality risk, especially in adults over 40. It's more important to stay consistent than to chase a specific number.  Other activities like cycling, swimming, strength training, and yoga may not add to your step count but still offer great health benefits. A well-rounded fitness plan includes more than just walking.  For many people, having a daily step goal serves as a motivational tool. Fitness trackers and step counters help build accountability and promote healthier habits over time, even if the goal varies per person.  Health is about consistency, not perfection. Missing the mark occasionally won't undo your progress. It's better to focus on moving regularly throughout the week than stressing over a single day's step count.  Regular walking, especially when combined with good nutrition and sleep, can support weight management and improve energy levels. It's a low-impact, sustainable way to stay active and burn calories.  Understanding the facts and myths around this number helps tailor fitness routines to individual needs.   Disclaimer: This content including advice provides generic information only.

Moisture in the atmosphere causes hair to absorb excess water, swell up, and lose its smooth structure leading to frizz, puffiness, and lack of manageability. Additionally, rainwater can strip away natural oils from the scalp and hair, making it dry and more prone to breakage. While commercial products are available, many people find effective and safer relief from natural, homemade remedies that nourish the hair, lock in moisture, and restore shine. Below we share a list of homemade remedies to help reduce frizziness for monsoon.   Mix 2 tablespoons of coconut oil with 2 tablespoons of fresh aloe vera gel. Apply this to your hair from roots to ends and leave it on for 30–45 minutes before washing. Coconut oil deeply nourishes and aloe vera soothes the scalp while sealing moisture into hair strands, reducing frizz.  Mash 1 ripe banana and mix it with 1 tablespoon of honey. Apply the paste evenly to damp hair and leave it on for 20–30 minutes. Bananas are rich in natural oils and potassium that soften hair, while honey acts as a humectant to retain moisture.  Combine half a cup of plain yogurt with 1 tablespoon of olive oil. After shampooing, use it as a conditioner. Yogurt provides protein and olive oil hydrates dry strands, smoothing out frizz naturally.  Mix 2 tablespoons of apple cider vinegar with 1 cup of water and use it as a final rinse after shampooing. This balances the hair's pH and smooths the cuticle, reducing frizz and adding natural shine.  Beat 1 egg with 1 tablespoon of olive oil. Apply this protein-rich mixture to your hair, leave it for 20 minutes, then wash off with a mild shampoo. This helps strengthen strands and tame frizz.  Soak 2 tablespoons of fenugreek seeds overnight and grind into a paste the next morning. Apply it to your scalp and hair for 30 minutes. Fenugreek is rich in lecithin which hydrates hair and fights frizziness naturally.  Mash half an avocado and mix with 2 tablespoons of curd. Apply this creamy mixture to your hair and let it sit for 30 minutes. Avocados are rich in vitamins and fatty acids that nourish dry, frizzy hair, while curd adds softness.  Save the water used for boiling rice and let it cool. Pour into a spray bottle and use it on damp hair after a wash. Rich in amino acids, rice water helps smoothen hair texture and reduce puffiness caused by humidity.  Warm some amla oil and gently massage it into your scalp once a week. Amla strengthens hair from the roots and helps retain moisture, preventing dryness and frizz.  Try these homemade remedies to reduce frizziness in the monsoon.

https://doctor.ndtv.com/nutrition/9-mental-health-issues-nutrient-deficiencies-it-could-indicate-8812494,9 Mental Health Issues & Nutrient Deficiencies It Could Indicate,"Updated: Jul 2, 2025 02:09 IST","Mental health issues can indeed be caused or worsened by nutrient deficiencies. The brain requires a range of vitamins, minerals, and amino acids to function properly, and when these are lacking, it can disrupt mood regulation, cognitive performance, and emotional resilience. A deficiency in these key nutrients can manifest as depression, anxiety, irritability, fatigue, or even more severe psychiatric symptoms. Addressing such deficiencies through diet or supplements, under medical supervision, can often lead to significant improvement in mental health. Keep reading as we share common nutreitn deficiencies and mental health issues it can cause.   Low levels of vitamin D have been strongly linked to symptoms of depression. Vitamin D helps regulate mood and ward off inflammation in the brain. Without enough sunlight or dietary sources, individuals may experience chronic sadness, fatigue, and lack of interest in activities.  Magnesium plays a key role in regulating the body's stress-response system. When deficient, the nervous system becomes more reactive, leading to heightened feelings of anxiety, restlessness, and irritability. Magnesium also helps with sleep, which can indirectly influence anxiety levels.  Iron is vital for oxygen transport to the brain and energy production. Its deficiency, especially in women, can result in fatigue, low motivation, brain fog, and even mood swings. It may mimic symptoms of depression or burnout.  Omega-3 fatty acids are essential for brain health and neurotransmitter regulation. Low levels are associated with increased mood instability, irritability, and even bipolar symptoms. Including fatty fish, flaxseeds, or supplements can help stabilise mood.  The B-vitamins are critical for the synthesis of neurotransmitters like serotonin, dopamine, and GABA. A deficiency in B6, B9 (folate), or B12 can result in poor concentration, mental fatigue, irritability, and depressive symptoms.  Both calcium and potassium play a role in muscle and nerve function. When deficient, nerve signals may misfire, leading to symptoms like palpitations, muscle spasms, and panic attacks. Replenishing these minerals can help reduce these physical triggers.  Sleep quality is deeply affected by mineral imbalances. Zinc and magnesium are needed to maintain healthy sleep patterns and regulate melatonin production. Their deficiencies may lead to insomnia, restless sleep, or frequent nighttime waking.  Selenium is a powerful antioxidant that protects the brain from oxidative stress. A deficiency may contribute to heightened anxiety, obsessive thoughts, and even symptoms related to OCD, due to its impact on thyroid function and mental clarity.  Vitamin E helps protect brain cells from oxidative stress. Inadequate levels may accelerate cognitive decline, increase forgetfulness, and contribute to neurodegenerative conditions, especially in older adults.  Watch out for these signs and nutrient deficiencies to ensure better overall health.  Disclaimer: This content including advice provides generic information only.

These include excessive screen time, lack of outdoor activity, poor nutrition, uncorrected refractive errors, and genetics. However, developing healthy daily habits can help support and protect your child's vision as they grow. Encouraging regular eye care, balanced diets, screen-time breaks, and eye-friendly routines can greatly reduce the risk of long-term vision issues and strain, ensuring their eyes stay healthy and functional. Keep reading as we share a list of daily habits to add to your kid's routine to reduce risk of vision problems.  This article explores some of the common eye problems in children, their symptoms, and the importance of regular eye check-ups for maintaining good vision health. World Sight Day 2023: Optometrists and ophthalmologists properly check the vision, alignment of eyes and overall eye health of your child.  Prolonged exposure to screens like TVs, tablets, smartphones, and computers can lead to digital eye strain and even myopia (nearsightedness). Set time limits for screen usage and encourage breaks every 20 minutes using the ""20-20-20 rule"".  Spending at least 1-2 hours outdoors daily has been shown to reduce the risk of myopia in children. Natural light and long-distance focusing help develop healthy vision, so outdoor games, cycling, or nature walks are highly beneficial.  Ensure your child reads or does homework in well-lit environments. Poor lighting can strain the eyes and lead to headaches and fatigue. Natural daylight or bright but soft artificial lighting is best for reducing eye stress.  Teach your child to keep books or screens at least 12–16 inches away from their eyes. Holding items too close can contribute to eye strain and increase the risk of developing nearsightedness.  Simple eye exercises like blinking frequently, rolling the eyes, or shifting focus from near to far can strengthen the eye muscles and reduce fatigue especially helpful after study or screen time.  Foods rich in vitamins A, C, E, zinc, and omega-3 fatty acids (like carrots, leafy greens, sweet potatoes, eggs, nuts, and fish) help support healthy eye function and reduce the risk of vision loss.  Adequate sleep is vital for eye health. Lack of rest can cause dry, tired eyes and poor visual performance. Stick to a consistent bedtime routine to allow their eyes and brain to recharge properly.  Dry eyes can result from dehydration. Ensure your child drinks enough water throughout the day to keep their eyes moisturised and comfortable, especially in dry or air-conditioned environments.  Kids often rub their eyes with dirty hands, which can lead to infections like conjunctivitis. Encourage clean hands, discourage eye rubbing, and teach the importance of not sharing towels or eye drops.  Many vision problems are silent in the early stages. Routine eye exams can help detect and address issues like lazy eye, strabismus, or uncorrected refractive errors early, boosting both vision and academic performance.  By integrating these small but powerful habits into your child's daily life, you can foster not just better eye health but also improved concentration, learning, and confidence.
