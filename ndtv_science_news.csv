The spacecraft was part of the Venera programme to gather information about Venus, but a malfunctioning timer prevented it from completing its mission.
According to satellite tracker Marco Langbroek, the spacecraft is now predicted to re-enter Earth's atmosphere around May 10, give or take a few days.

The spacecraft's fate is uncertain, with experts debating whether it will burn up or survive re-entry. If it survives, it could land between 51.7 degrees north and south latitude, potentially impacting populated areas or oceans.
Orbital updates have resumed (yay!), see my latest forecast here:https://t.co/q006UTzlFhCurrent forecast from our reentry model: 10 May 14:30 UTC +- 2.2 days. Latest model runs are slowly creeping to a slightly later reentry time.pic.twitter.com/jYBNv6ctsg
Kosmos 482 is approximately 480 kilograms and one metre in diameter. Experts are skeptical that the parachute system would still function after all these years, and the heat shield could be damaged. Without the heat shield, the spacecraft would burn up, but if it does persist, a half-tonne metal object will suddenly drop from the sky.
The landing site for the spacecraft is unknown, and there are chance that it will land in the ocean. The event also draws attention to the increasing concern regarding space debris and uncontrolled re-entry risks.

Launched on March 31, 1972, the Kosmos 482 Descent Craft, weighing just under 500kg, is expected to reenter Earth's atmosphere at a speed of about 250 km per hour, posing a risk similar to a meteorite impact, according to a report inThe Independent, citing a tracker.
When launched, the Soviet probe was bound for Venus, but a technical failure locked it in a perpetual orbit around Earth. However, it is expected to start falling back to the Earth in an uncontrolled re-entry around May 10.
""In about 2 weeks from now, an unusual uncontrolled reentry will happen: a 53-year-old landing capsule from a failed Soviet Venera mission stuck in Earth orbit,"" Dutch satellite tracker Marco Langbroek wrote on X (formerly Twitter).

Since the probe was designed to withstand acceleration, high pressures, and extreme heat on Venus, there is a small chance it might survive the reentry when most space objects disintegrate upon entering the Earth's atmosphere.
""As this is a lander that was designed to survive passage through the Venus atmosphere, it is possible it will survive reentry through the Earth atmosphere intact, and impact intact,"" said Mr Langbroek.
""There are many uncertain factors in this though, including that this will be a long shallow reentry trajectory and the age of the object.""
As for where the object will crash on Earth, it is still far too early to tell. However, with an orbital inclination of 51.7 degrees, the reentry can occur anywhere between latitudes 52 degrees north and 52 degrees south. While it is likely that the probe will crash into a water body, there is a small chance it might thud into land.

https://www.ndtv.com/science/is-gravity-the-code-new-theory-suggests-the-universe-is-a-giant-quantum-computer-8288118,Is Gravity The Code? New Theory Suggests The Universe Is A Giant Quantum Computer,"Tue, 29 Apr 2025 20:04:05 +0530","A groundbreaking study proposes that gravity might be a product of computational processes within the universe, hinting that the cosmos could be operating like a giant quantum computer. Physicist Melvin Vopson from the University of Portsmouth suggests that gravity could be a by-product of the universe's attempt to organize information and matter in space and time.
Thisnew theoryraises intriguing questions about the nature of reality and whether we are living in a simulated environment. If proven true, it could revolutionize our understanding of the universe and its underlying mechanisms.
Dr Melvin Vopsonsuggeststhat gravity might actually be caused by how information about matter is organised in the universe. Using the second law of information dynamics, he indicates that matter and objects in space may be being pulled together because the universe is trying to keep information tidy and compressed.
Dr Vopson said: ""My findings in this study fit with the thought that the universe might work like a giant computer, or our reality is a simulated construct. Just like computers try to save space and run more efficiently, the universe might be doing the same. It's a new way to think about gravity - not just as a pull, but as something that happens when the universe is trying to stay organised.""
Dr Vopson has previously published research suggesting that information has mass and that all elementary particles - the smallest known building blocks of the universe - store information about themselves, similar to the way cells, the building blocks of biological entities, have DNA.
In this latest research, Dr Vopson shows how space pixelation in elementary cells can act as a data storage medium, and demonstrates how the role of information stored in elementary cells is to provide the properties and the coordinates of matter in the space-time simulated construct. Each cell can register information in the form of binary data so if it is empty it registers a digital ""0"", and if matter is present in a cell it registers a digital ""1"".
Dr Vopson added: ""The process is identical to how a digital computer game, virtual reality application, or other advanced simulation would be designed.""
He explains that as a cell can accommodate more than one particle, then the system will evolve itself by moving the particles in space to join them together into a single larger particle inside a single cell.
""This triggers the attracting force because of the rule set in the computational system, requiring the minimisation of the information content, and by extension, a reduction of the computational power. Put simply, it is far more computationally effective to track and compute the location and momentum of a single object in space, than numerous objects. Therefore, it appears that the gravitational attraction is just another optimising mechanism in a computational process that has the role to compress information.""

Under a Rs 6.04 crore (585,000 Swiss francs) pilot project, as many as 48 solar panels have been placed on a 100-metre portion of railway tracks in Buttes, a small village in western Switzerland.
The technology has been developed by Sun-Ways after its founder, Joseph Scuderi, first had the idea in 2020 while waiting for a train. After receiving a green light from the Federal Office of Transport (FOT), the startup deployed the solar panels on the railway line, currently being operated by transN.
""We installed solar panels as we would on the roof of a house,"" Mr Scuderi toldSwissinfo, adding that getting this far ""has been a miracle"".
Notably, the project was initially rejected by FOT in 2023 over concerns that the solar panels could affect the safety of the trains and related maintenance efforts. However, Sun-Ways consulted experts to conduct an independent study on the proposal to prove that the specialised solar panels would not interfere with the active railway.
While solar panels are usually permanently fixed, Sun-Ways has developed a proprietary technology where the panels can be removed whenever required so that the track maintenance team can perform its job. Swiss track maintenance company Scheuchzer can place and remove nearly 1,000 square metres of solar panels in just a few hours.

As per the company, the photovoltaic current produced by the solar panels could be used in three ways. In the first scenario, the energy could be ""reinjected"" to power the railway infrastructure (switches, signals, stations) while in second instance, the current can be fed into the electricity network of the nearest local GRD (Distribution Network Operator).
However, Sun-Ways claims that reinjecting the current into the traction energy network that powers the locomotives is the best way to extract the full benefits of the pilot programme. Sun-Ways says the approximately 5,320 kilometres of the Swiss rail network could generate one billion kWh of solar power per year, which is enough to fulfil the consumption demand of 300,000 households.
""It is good that rail and public transport companies are innovating, including in renewable energy production,"" said Florence Pictet, spokesperson for the FOT.
Sun-Ways says it has already received interest from countries such as China and the US while collaborating on similar projects in South Korea, Spain and Romania.

UK Scientist Makes Bold Claim,"Tue, 29 Apr 2025 11:30:34 +0530","Are we living in a simulated reality like in the movie'The Matrix'?Dr. Melvin Vopson, a UK-based physicist, suggests that gravity might be evidence we're living in a virtual world, with the universe acting like a giant computer. His theory echoes the 1999 film's concept of a simulated universe, but with a scientific twist.Dr. Vopson's researchsuggests that gravity might be a form of data organisation, similar to computer code compression. He proposes that the universe's tendency to pull objects with mass towards the Earth's core is analogous to how computers optimise data, supporting the idea that our universe could be a simulated or computational construct.
""The universe evolves in a way that the information content in it is compressed, optimised and organised – just as computers and computer code do. Hence, gravity appears to be another process of data compression in a possibly simulated universe,"" he told theDaily Mail.
According to the study, gravity reduces ""information entropy,"" or the amount of information an object holds in a given space. Gravity shapes galaxies, orbits planets around stars, and affects nearby objects' motion. In Dr Vopson's theory, gravity pulls objects together as the universe strives to keep information organised and compressed.
""To put it simply, it is easier to compute all the properties and characteristics of a single object in space, rather than multiple objects. That is why objects in space are pulled together,"" Dr Vopson added.
Dr. Vopson's idea builds on hisprevious workon entropy in information theory, which likely explores how information systems tend to become more disordered or complex over time.
""A super complex universe like ours, if it were a simulation, would require a built-in data optimisation and compression to reduce the computational power and the data storage requirements to run the simulation. This is exactly what we are observing all around us, including in digital data, biological systems, mathematical symmetries and the entire universe,"" heexplained in 2023.
This time, he shifted his focus from biological systems to gravity, exploring its potential connection to information theory and the simulated universe hypothesis.
""My findings in this study fit with the thought that the universe might work like a giant computer, or our reality is a simulated construct. Just like computers try to save space and run more efficiently, the universe might be doing the same. It's a new way to think about gravity – not just as a pull, but as something that happens when the universe is trying to stay organised,"" Mr Vopsonexplained.

According to Forbes, the event took place on Sunday, April 27. The moon blocked 23% of the sun in a partial eclipse, but it was not possible to see this from Earth. The images of the ""lunar transit"" show in its entirety, before a large dark orb - moon - passes by, blocking almost a quarter of the star from view.
NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)is a semi-autonomous spacecraft that points at the sun, allowing almost continuous observation. The satellite was launched in February 2010. Since then, it has observed multiple lunar transits, or eclipses, many of which are not visible from Earth.
According to NASA, there will be another eclipse on May 25 that will cover only four per cent of the sun. Another eclipse is due on July 25, which is expected to cover 62% of the sun.
This is not the first time an eclipse has been seen by SDO or by astronauts in space. According to Forbes, several Apollo astronauts witnessed an eclipse of the sun as they travelled to the moon.

Notably, the last solar eclipse visible from Earth was in March this year, which caused the moon to turn a deep red colour. The phenomenon is known as a Blood Moon, as the same atmospheric effect that causes sunsets to appear red affects the moon.
""A lunar eclipse occurs when the Sun, Earth, and Moon align so that the Moon passes into Earth's shadow. In a total lunar eclipse, the entire Moon falls within the darkest part of Earth's shadow, called the umbra,"" NASA said at the time.
The next solar eclipse visible from Earth will be on September 21. It will be visible from New Zealand, the South Pacific and Antarctica.
A total solar eclipse will take place on August 12, 2026. It will be visible from within a narrow path of totality that passes through eastern Greenland, western Iceland and northern Spain, with totality lasting just over two minutes. The total eclipse is the best kind, during which the moon momentarily blocks out all of the sun, allowing its corona to be seen with the naked eye.

""People haven't got it yet, people haven't understood what's coming,"" warned Mr Hinton in aCBSinterview.
""I'm in the unfortunate position of happening to agree with Elon Musk on this, which is that there's a 10 to 20 per cent chance that these things will take over, but that's just a wild guess,"" he added.
Mr Hinton was referring to the Tesla CEO, who has claimed that AI will become smarter than the entire human race by 2029. Mr Musk is also the chief executive of xAI, the company that developed the AI chatbot Grok.
According to Mr Hinton, AI companies should dedicate a ""third of their computing power"" or significantly more resources to safety research.
""If you look at what the big companies are doing right now, they're lobbying to get less AI regulation. There's hardly any regulation as it is, but they want less,"" Mr Hinton said.

Mr Hinton laid the foundations for machine learning that is powering today's AI-based products and applications. However, the Nobel laureate grew wary of AI's future development and cut ties with his employer, Google, in order to speak more freely on the issue.
""It will be comparable with the industrial revolution. But instead of exceeding people in physical strength, it's going to exceed people in intellectual ability. We have no experience of what it's like to have things smarter than us,"" said Mr Hinton at the time.
""I am worried that the overall consequence of this might be systems more intelligent than us that eventually take control.""
Mr Hinton has been a big advocate of government regulation for the technology, especially given the exceptional pace of development.
Apart from Mr Hinton, Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis has also warned about the perils of AI. In a recent interview, Mr Hassabis said society is not ready for human-level AI, popularly referred to as Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).
The 2024 Nobel Prize in Chemistry winner said AI systems capable of human-level cognitive abilities were only five to ten years away and that such development was keeping him up at night.

According to food researchers at the Technical University of Munich, a mushroom calledAmaropostia stiptica, better known as bitter bracket fungus, is officially the 'most bitter thing in the world', as per a report in theBBC.
The mushroom is widely available in Britain, and despite being extremely bitter, it is not toxic. The researchers extracted three compounds from the mushroom and studied their effect on human taste receptors.
This tree-growing mushroom has a compound that is so potent that an individual would be able to taste a single gram of the substance dissolved in 106 bathtubs of water. Named oligoporin D, this chemical activates specialised bitter receptors in our mouths which also help detect natural poisons.

The study results, published in theJournal of Agricultural and Food Chemistrymay help scientists research how humans evolved to be able to detect bitter tastes and why. Notably, bitter is one of the five basic taste sensations humans have, alongside sweet, sour, salty and savoury, also called ""umami"".
""Our results contribute to expanding our knowledge of the molecular diversity and mode of action of natural bitter compounds,"" said lead researcher Dr Maik Behrens.
""In the long term, insights in this area could enable new applications in food and health research, for example in the development of sensorially appealing foods that positively influence digestion and satiety.""
Prior to the German study, most of the research had centred around how flowering plants can have a bitter taste. However, fewer studies had been done looking at fungi such as mushrooms.
Studies show that sensors for bitter substances are also found in the stomach, intestines, heart and lungs apart from the mouth.
Previous studies have indicated that sensors for bitter substances are not only found in the mouth but also in the stomach, intestines, heart and lungs. Researchers stated that closely analysing compounds derived from fungi like oligoporin D could be key to understanding our complex relationship with bitterness.

Using the Korea Microlensing Telescope Network (KMTNet), an international team of researchers has discovered that super-Earth exoplanets are more common across the universe than previously thought, according to a new study.
By studying light anomalies made by the newly found planet's host star and combining their results with a larger sample from a KMTNet microlensing survey, the team found that super-Earths can exist as far from their host star as our gas giants are from the sun, said Andrew Gould, co-author of the study and professor emeritus of astronomy at The Ohio State University.
""Scientists knew there were more small planets than big planets, but in this study, we were able to show that within this overall pattern, there are excesses and deficits,"" he said. ""It's very interesting.""
While it can be relatively easy to locate worlds that orbit close to their star, planets with wider paths can be difficult to detect.
Still, researchers further estimated that for every three stars, there should be at least one super-Earth present with a Jupiter-like orbital period, suggesting these massive worlds are extremely prevalent across the universe, said Gould, whose early theoretical research helped develop the field of planetary microlensing.
The findings in this study were made via microlensing, an observational effect that occurs when the presence of mass warps the fabric of space-time to a detectable degree.
When a foreground object, such as a star or planet, passes between an observer and a more distant star, light is curved from the source, causing an apparent increase in the object's brightness that can last anywhere from a few hours to several months.

As per a new study published on the preprint serverarXiv, the Great Wall, which is located 10 billion light-years from Earth, could be as large as 15 billion light-years in size, up from the previous estimate of 10 billion light-years long.
Using a recently developed methodology, scientists re-examined the Great Wall, which was first discovered, more than a decade ago.
""Evidence is provided that the Hercules-Corona Borealis Great Wall cluster is larger than previously thought. The extension of this cluster's size does not appear to have been due to statistical variations or sampling biases,"" the study highlighted.
By analysing the gamma-ray bursts that are produced during extreme cosmic events such as the collapse of a supernova, the birth of a black hole, or the collision of two neutron stars, scientists managed to figure out the new length of the Great Wall.
The team examined 542 gamma-ray bursts with known redshifts, which showed that the Great Wall may extend from a redshift of 0.33 to a redshift of 2.43 -- a total distance of around 15 billion light-years
""We also found evidence that the Hercules-Corona Borealis Great Wall is larger than previously identified and that it appears to encompass several smaller clusters,"" it added.

In February this year, scientists claimed to have discovered another large superstructure called Quipu, believed to measure 1.3 billion light-years across, which is over 13,000 times the length of the Milky Way.
As per the study, Quipu is responsible for a ""large part of the gravitational pull that causes the peculiar motion of the Local Group with respect to the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) frame"". However, more information is needed to identify the effects of such a structure on its neighbourhood.
The scientists added that while the superstructure was massive in size currently, it would soon collapse and form independent units.
Studying an object as massive as the Great Wall or Quipu could help scientists broaden their understanding of how galaxies evolve and improve the existing cosmological models.

The Houston-based company has been contracted by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and NASA to fly Group Captain Shukla to the space station next month.
Mr Bhatia, whose parents immigrated from India to New York in 1970, is a former Google executive and a Columbia University graduate.
""The opportunity to work with India on the Axiom-4 mission and its future space ambitions is a dream come true, spanning multiple generations and continents. It is the ultimate honour and responsibility to represent our ancestors and our future generations around the world,"" he told NDTV.
In an official statement, he said that space exploration has inspired him since childhood.
""Leading Axiom Space at this critical inflection point in human spaceflight is the realisation of a lifelong ambition. We are accelerating our investment in next-generation technologies - spacesuits, orbital infrastructure, and microgravity research and manufacturing - and we're actively seeking passionate, visionary engineers, technologists, and entrepreneurs who want to help build humanity's future in space,"" Mr Bhatia, who first worked as Axiom Space's Chief Revenue Officer for four years, said.
It was Mr Bhatia who suggested that the company could help an Indian to fly to space.
""I have almost made it a challenge that if someone tells me something, it's impossible, I will do it just to prove that it's possible, because the reason for doing the impossible is you set the bar for what is possible,"" he said.
""For example, when it was [about] doing the deal with India, people said that's impossible, they're never going to fly, and I was like, I'll just go knock on the door of the embassy. And it's like, you can't do that. And I wasn't going to just knock on the door of the embassy because they told me I couldn't. I actually just showed up and knocked on the door of the embassy,"" he said.
The joint mission got a formal mention when Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited the White House in 2024.
Mr Bhatia said he first heard the calling to work in the space industry when he was three years old and his family visited the Kennedy Space Center.
In the 1990s, he studied computer science at Columbia University with a focus on streaming video. He then worked for ESPN to help launch their first HD streaming of sports online, an innovation that would form the foundation for modern-day streaming services.
He then went on to become the founder and CEO of three of his own companies - Explain Everything, Chatwala, and Kaptur.
He was introduced to Axiom Space for the first time while working for Citi Ventures, Citibank's venture capital arm. He left Citi Ventures for Google and joined Axiom four years later.
Under Mr Bhatia's leadership, Axiom Space will accelerate delivery of the world's first commercial, human-rated space station, leveraging its exclusive authorisation to connect its first module to the International Space Station in 2027.
The Axiom-4 mission crew members are Shubhanshu Shukla (India), Peggy Whitson (US), Slawosz Uznanski-Wisniewski (Poland) and Tibor Kapu (Hungary).

While Ms Whitson, the former NASA astronaut and Axiom Space's Director of Human Spaceflight, will command the commercial mission, Mr Shukla will be the mission pilot.
Slawosz Uznanski-Wisniewski, the European Space Agency project astronaut, and Tibor Kap will be the two mission specialists.
The crew is currently preparing for the flight on the SpaceX Falcon-9 rocket and SpaceX Crew Dragon from Kennedy Space Center in Florida.
Axiom said the mission will ""realise the return"" to human spaceflight for India, Poland, and Hungary, with each nation's first government-sponsored flight in more than 40 years.
While Ax-4 marks these countries' second human spaceflight mission in history, it will be the first time all three nations will execute a mission on board the International Space Station.
On this fully commercial mission, India is paying all the costs for the training and the flight to the ISS. The estimated costs are between $60 and $70 million for the one-off single seat on this private space mission.
India has chosen Group Captain Shukla as the primary astronaut and Group Captain Prasanth Balakrishnan Nair as his backup for the nearly fortnight-long mission.
The partnership between Axiom Space and NASA provided the astronauts with comprehensive instruction and guidance for their mission, leveraging the expertise and resources of both organisations.

These medications, known as GLP-1 drugs, mimic a natural hormone that regulates blood sugar and appetite. However, studies suggest they may also affect parts of the brain related to dopamine, a chemical linked to feelings of pleasure and reward.
According to the research that was published in thejournal Current Neuropharmacology, GLP-1 drugs may disrupt dopamine levels, potentially leading to depression and suicidal thoughts in individuals with low dopamine function. While these medications show promise in treating obesity and diabetes, further investigation is needed to understand their potential impact on mental health.
As per anews release, the study, led by researchers across the United States, Brazil, Iran, and Israel, demonstrates that while GLP1 agonists benefit individuals with hyperdopaminergia (excess dopamine activity), they may have harmful effects on individuals with hypodopaminergia (low dopamine function). The authors found genetic associations between GLP1 receptor agonists and genes such as DRD3, BDNF, and CREB1, which are implicated in mood regulation and reward pathways. Their findings suggest that chronic use of these drugs could dysregulate dopamine signalling, potentially leading to depressive symptoms, mood disturbances, and SI.
While the idea of GLP-1 agonism induction of depression and SI is controversial with both negative and positive reporting, based on the evidence presented in this article by Alireza Sharafshah, a PhD candidate from the Cellular and Molecular Research Centre, School of Medicine, Guilan University of Medical Sciences, Rasht, Iran, the authors caution against promoting chronic stimulation via GLP-1 agonists.
""This study should not be ignored, despite the hype surrounding the positive clinical outcomes of GLP-1 receptor agonists,"" said senior author Dr Kenneth Blum, research professor at Western University Health Sciences and Ariel University. ""We urge the clinical prescribing community to proceed with caution to avoid another tragic wave of 'people dying to lose weight'.""
Dr Mark S Gold, an addiction psychiatry pioneer and co-author, emphasised, ""The paper provides critical evidence for re-evaluating the widespread use of GLP1 receptor agonists. The FDA and other regulatory agencies should carefully consider our findings when it comes to labelling and monitoring these drugs.""

This connection was more pronounced in men and individuals classified as underweight or overweight, suggesting that the distribution of body fat may play a role in mental well-being.
The findings, published in the prestigiousjournal Nature Metabolismon April 15, 2025, are particularly relevant given the rising rates of anxiety and obesity, highlighting the importance of understanding the underlying biological processes.
""Understanding the link between adipose tissue and anxiety opens up new avenues for research and potential treatments,""says Gregory Steinberg, senior author on the paper and a professor in the Department of Medicine at McMaster.
""Our findings highlight the complex interplay between metabolism and mental health, and we hope this will lead to better outcomes for individuals suffering from anxiety,"" says Steinberg, a Canada Research Chair in Metabolism and Obesity and the co-director of the Centre for Metabolism, Obesity and Diabetes Research at McMaster.
As per anews release,the research team discovered that psychological stress, which triggers the fight or flight response, initiates a process called lipolysis in fat cells. This process leads to the release of fats, which in turn stimulate the release of a hormone called GDF15 from immune cells found in the fat tissue. GDF15 then communicates with the brain, resulting in anxiety.
Researchers came to their conclusion through a series of meticulously designed experiments involving mice. Behavioural tests assessed anxiety-like behaviour, and molecular analyses identified the activated pathways. A clear connection between metabolic changes in adipose tissue and anxiety was established, offering new insights into the interplay between metabolism and mental health.
""These findings open up exciting possibilities for developing new treatments for anxiety by focusing on metabolic pathways,"" says Logan Townsend, first author on the paper and a postdoctoral fellow at McMaster.
""By understanding how stress-induced changes in fat cells can influence anxiety, we can explore innovative therapeutic strategies that target these metabolic processes, potentially offering more effective and targeted relief for individuals suffering from anxiety disorders. Several companies are developing blockers of GDF15 for treating cancer, so it is possible these will find use for anxiety as well,"" says Townsend.

https://www.ndtv.com/science/are-earthquakes-hiding-secret-nuclear-tests-new-study-raises-concerns-8260838,Are Earthquakes Hiding Secret Nuclear Tests? New Study Raises Concerns,"Sat, 26 Apr 2025 12:46:12 +0530","A recent review by seismologists at Los Alamos National Laboratory suggests that some earthquakes might actually be covert underground nuclear tests. The study, led by Joshua Carmichael and published in the Bulletin of the Seismological Society of America, highlights the challenges in distinguishing between natural seismic events and clandestine nuclear explosions.
According to a new review articlepublished in the Bulletin of the Seismological Society of Americathat contradicts the conventional wisdom about explosion ""masking.""
Underground nuclear tests can produce seismic signals similar to those of natural earthquakes, making detection difficult. However, advancements in seismic monitoring techniques, such as analyzing the ratio of compressional (P) waves to shear (S) waves, have improved the ability to differentiate between the two. Explosions typically generate more P-waves relative to S-waves compared to earthquakes.
Thenew analysisby Joshua Carmichael and colleagues at Los Alamos National Laboratory found that advanced signal detector technology that can identify a 1.7-ton buried explosion with a 97% success rate only has a 37% success rate when seismic signals from that explosion are hidden within the seismic waveforms of an earthquake that happens within 100 seconds and about 250 kilometers away from the explosion.
The overlapping waveforms of explosion and earthquake ""obfuscate the ability of even the most sensitive digital signal detectors we have to identify that explosion,""said Carmichael.
The findings could lead experts to reconsider a 2012 report that concluded earthquake signals could not cover up explosion signals. Potential explosion masking by natural seismic signals is a concern for the community of scientists charged with nuclear test monitoring around the globe.
In North Korea, which has held six nuclear tests over the past 20 years, an increase in regional seismic instruments shows that ""there's been a lot more low-magnitude seismicity in the vicinity of test sites than we initially realized,"" Carmichael noted.
The new findings suggest that ""background seismicity in regions where there's any sort of seismicity at all is going to measurably and substantially reduce the probability that we can detect signals from an underground explosion at a test site,"" he added.
The researchers also found that natural signals from earthquake swarms or other repeating seismic events could be similarly hidden by overlapping waveforms. In this case, the masking effect dropped detection from a 92% to a 16% detection rate.
""This may mean that we probably underestimate a lot of the low magnitude seismicity that is sourced during a swarm or an aftershock sequence,"" Carmichael said. ""In other words, we could be largely undercounting the number of earthquakes that occur in these swarms or in certain aftershock sequences.""
Explosion masking has been difficult to test because there are so few explosions to examine, and very few data sets that contain both explosion and natural seismic signals.

Scientists Explore Quantum Immortality,"Fri, 25 Apr 2025 20:50:51 +0530","Scientists have proposed a mind-bending concept known as quantum immortality, which suggests that our consciousness may never truly die but instead shift to an alternate reality upon encountering death. This theory is based on physicist Hugh Everett's many-worlds theory, which proposes the existence of multiple parallel universes.
According to researchers, every time we face death in one universe, our consciousness would supposedly transfer to another universe where we survive. This raises intriguing possibilities, including the notion that we may have experienced multiple catastrophic events without being aware of them.
A recent online video by TikTok user @joli.artist has sparked discussion about quantum immortality, with some users exploring its implications and potential consequences. Physicists Frank Pollman and Ruben Verresen have also contributed to the discussion, suggesting that strong interactions can stop decay entirely and lead to sustained oscillations between decay and rebirth.
""Until now, the assumption was that quasiparticles in interacting quantum systems decay after a certain time,""said physicist Frank Pollmanof the Technical University of Munich back in June 2019.
""We now know that the opposite is the case: strong interactions can even stop decay entirely.""
""The result of the elaborate simulation: admittedly, quasiparticles do decay; however, new, identical particle entities emerge from the debris,""said physicist Ruben Verresenof the Technical University of Munich and the Max Planck Institute for the Physics of Complex Systems.
""If this decay proceeds very quickly, an inverse reaction will occur after a certain time, and the debris will converge again. This process can recur endlessly, and a sustained oscillation between decay and rebirth emerges.""
While the concept of quantum immortality is still speculative, it challenges traditional notions of mortality and the nature of consciousness. Further research is needed to fully understand the implications of this theory.

New Study Reveals Shocking Possibility,"Fri, 25 Apr 2025 18:15:47 +0530","A new study by the University of Surrey suggests that time might not be as linear as we think. Researchers propose that, at the quantum level, time could flow in both forward and backward directions simultaneously. This theory challenges our traditional understanding of time's arrow, which assumes time moves irreversibly from past to future.
In a paper published in thejournal Scientific Reports,findings indicate that certain quantum systems can have two arrows of time, one moving forward and another backward. This raises the astonishing possibility that time could be flowing in reverse all around us, and we might not even be aware of it. The discovery could revolutionize our understanding of thermodynamics, quantum mechanics, and the universe's creation.
""Microscopically speaking, if you think about the arrow of time, we essentially rely on proxies,""says the paper's senior author,Andrea Rocco, PhD, associate professor of physics and mathematical biology at the University of Surrey. At the subatomic level where quantum mechanics operates, we can't always see obvious changes that indicate time's passage. Instead, we need to look at other indicators, like entropy.
Dr Andrea Rocco, Associate Professor in Physics and Mathematical Biology at the University of Surrey and lead author of the study, said, ""One way to explain this is when you look at a process like spilled milk spreading across a table, it's clear that time is moving forward. But if you were to play that in reverse, like a movie, you'd immediately know something was wrong-it would be hard to believe milk could just gather back into a glass.
""However, there are processes, such as the motion of a pendulum, that look just as believable in reverse. The puzzle is that, at the most fundamental level, the laws of physics resemble the pendulum; they do not account for irreversible processes.
""Our findings suggest that while our common experience tells us that time only moves one way, we are just unaware that the opposite direction would have been equally possible.""
The study explored how a quantum system-the world of the sub-atomic-interacts with its environment, known as an ""open quantum system.""

The study, involving 3,222 adolescents aged 9 to 14, found that those with slightly better sleep habits (averaging 7 hours, 25 minutes per night) showed noticeable improvements in reading, problem-solving, and focus compared to those with the worst sleep habits (averaging 7 hours, 10 minutes). While there was little difference in academic achievement between the groups, the cognitive benefits of even 15 extra minutes of sleep highlight the importance of sleep quality for adolescent brain development.
""Even though the differences in the amount of sleep that each group got was relatively small, at just over a quarter-of-an-hour between the best and worst sleepers, we could still see differences in brain structure and activity and in how well they did at tasks,""says clinical neuropsychologist Barbara Sahakianfrom the University of Cambridge.
""This drives home to us just how important it is to have a good night's sleep at this important time in life.""
First author Dr Qing Ma from Fudan University said: ""Although our study can't answer conclusively whether young people have better brain function and perform better at tests because they sleep better, there are a number of studies that would support this idea. For example, research has shown the benefits of sleep on memory, especially on memory consolidation, which is important for learning.""
The researchers also assessed the participants' heart rates, finding that Group Three had the lowest heart rates across the sleep states and Group One the highest. Lower heart rates are usually a sign of better health, whereas higher rates often accompany poor sleep quality like restless sleep, frequent awakenings and excessive daytime sleepiness.

The project is part of a Rs 567 crore (50 million pound) government-funded programme under which several small-scale experiments will be conducted to assess the potential of the technology, according to a report inThe Telegraph.
The Advanced Research and Invention Agency (Aria) is backing the solar geoengineering project, which has piqued the interest of scientists worldwide.
""We have strong requirements around the length of time experiments can run for and their reversibility and we won't be funding the release of any toxic substances to the environment,"" said Professor Mark Symes, the programme director for Aria.
One of the experiments involves releasing tiny particles into the stratosphere to reflect sunlight. Another potential solution is marine cloud brightening in which ""ships would spray sea-salt particles into the sky to enhance the reflectivity of low-lying clouds"".
If successful, it could temporarily reduce surface temperatures, delaying the climate crisis and giving more time for the deep cuts in global carbon emissions needed. However, geoengineering projects that seek to artificially alter the climate have proven controversial, with critics arguing that they could have damaging knock-on effects.
Additionally, scientists warn that focusing on these experiments could reduce the drive to tackle the root cause of the climate emergency -- the burning of fossil fuels.

Despite the backlash, Mr Symes is of the view that Earth was reaching a series of tipping points and such experiments were necessary to arrest the slide.
""The uncomfortable truth is that our current warming trajectory makes a number of such tipping points distinctly possible over the next century,"" said Mr Symes.
""This has driven increased interest in approaches that might actively cool the world in a short timeframe in order to avoid those tipping points.""
Apart from outdoor experiments, Aria will be funding new modelling studies, indoor tests, climate monitoring and gauging public attitudes to geoengineering.

In an interview withTime, Mr Hassabis was quizzed about what keeps him up at night, to which he talked about AGI, which was in the final steps of becoming reality.
The 2024 Nobel Prize in Chemistry winner said AI systems capable of human-level cognitive abilities were only five to ten years away.
""For me, it's this question of international standards and cooperation and also not just between countries, but also between companies and researchers as we get towards the final steps of AGI. And I think we are on the cusp of that. Maybe we are five to 10 years out. Some people say shorter, I wouldn't be surprised,"" said Mr Hassabis.
""It's a sort of like probability distribution. But it's coming, either way it's coming very soon and I'm not sure society's quite ready for that yet. And we need to think that through and also think about these issues that I talked about earlier, to do with the controllability of these systems and also the access to these systems and ensuring that all goes well,"" he added.
Sir Demis Hassabis on what keeps him up at night: As we approach ""the final steps toward AGI,"" safety still matters -- but it's coordination that haunts him.""It's coming… and I'm not sure society's ready.""How will countries, companies, and labs align before it's too late?pic.twitter.com/W0WZRmcaM8
This is not the first instance when Mr Hassabis has warned about the perils of AGI. He has previously batted for a UN-like umbrella organisation to oversee AGI's development.
""I would advocate for a kind of CERN for AGI, and by that, I mean a kind of international research focused high-end collaboration on the frontiers of AGI development to try and make that as safe as possible,"" said Mr Hassabis in February.
""You would also have to pair it with a kind of an institute like IAEA, to monitor unsafe projects and sort of deal with those. And finally, some kind of supervening body that involves many countries around the world. So a kind of like UN umbrella, something that is fit for purpose for that, a technical UN,"" he added.

""Given the massive potential impact of AGI, we expect that it too could pose potential risk of severe harm,"" the study highlighted, adding that existential risks that ""permanently destroy humanity"" are clear examples of severe harm.
AGI takes AI a step further. While AI is task-specific, AGI aims to possess intelligence that can be applied across a wide range of tasks, similar to human intelligence.

According to satellite tracker Marco Langbroek, the spacecraft is now predicted to re-enter Earth's atmosphere around May 10, give or take a few days.

The spacecraft's fate is uncertain, with experts debating whether it will burn up or survive re-entry. If it survives, it could land between 51.7 degrees north and south latitude, potentially impacting populated areas or oceans.
Orbital updates have resumed (yay!), see my latest forecast here:https://t.co/q006UTzlFhCurrent forecast from our reentry model: 10 May 14:30 UTC +- 2.2 days. Latest model runs are slowly creeping to a slightly later reentry time.pic.twitter.com/jYBNv6ctsg
Kosmos 482 is approximately 480 kilograms and one metre in diameter. Experts are skeptical that the parachute system would still function after all these years, and the heat shield could be damaged. Without the heat shield, the spacecraft would burn up, but if it does persist, a half-tonne metal object will suddenly drop from the sky.
The landing site for the spacecraft is unknown, and there are chance that it will land in the ocean. The event also draws attention to the increasing concern regarding space debris and uncontrolled re-entry risks.

Since the probe was designed to withstand acceleration, high pressures, and extreme heat on Venus, there is a small chance it might survive the reentry when most space objects disintegrate upon entering the Earth's atmosphere.
""As this is a lander that was designed to survive passage through the Venus atmosphere, it is possible it will survive reentry through the Earth atmosphere intact, and impact intact,"" said Mr Langbroek.
""There are many uncertain factors in this though, including that this will be a long shallow reentry trajectory and the age of the object.""
As for where the object will crash on Earth, it is still far too early to tell. However, with an orbital inclination of 51.7 degrees, the reentry can occur anywhere between latitudes 52 degrees north and 52 degrees south. While it is likely that the probe will crash into a water body, there is a small chance it might thud into land.

New Theory Suggests The Universe Is A Giant Quantum Computer,"Tue, 29 Apr 2025 20:04:05 +0530","A groundbreaking study proposes that gravity might be a product of computational processes within the universe, hinting that the cosmos could be operating like a giant quantum computer. Physicist Melvin Vopson from the University of Portsmouth suggests that gravity could be a by-product of the universe's attempt to organize information and matter in space and time.
Thisnew theoryraises intriguing questions about the nature of reality and whether we are living in a simulated environment. If proven true, it could revolutionize our understanding of the universe and its underlying mechanisms.
Dr Melvin Vopsonsuggeststhat gravity might actually be caused by how information about matter is organised in the universe. Using the second law of information dynamics, he indicates that matter and objects in space may be being pulled together because the universe is trying to keep information tidy and compressed.
Dr Vopson said: ""My findings in this study fit with the thought that the universe might work like a giant computer, or our reality is a simulated construct. Just like computers try to save space and run more efficiently, the universe might be doing the same. It's a new way to think about gravity - not just as a pull, but as something that happens when the universe is trying to stay organised.""
Dr Vopson has previously published research suggesting that information has mass and that all elementary particles - the smallest known building blocks of the universe - store information about themselves, similar to the way cells, the building blocks of biological entities, have DNA.
In this latest research, Dr Vopson shows how space pixelation in elementary cells can act as a data storage medium, and demonstrates how the role of information stored in elementary cells is to provide the properties and the coordinates of matter in the space-time simulated construct. Each cell can register information in the form of binary data so if it is empty it registers a digital ""0"", and if matter is present in a cell it registers a digital ""1"".
Dr Vopson added: ""The process is identical to how a digital computer game, virtual reality application, or other advanced simulation would be designed.""
He explains that as a cell can accommodate more than one particle, then the system will evolve itself by moving the particles in space to join them together into a single larger particle inside a single cell.
""This triggers the attracting force because of the rule set in the computational system, requiring the minimisation of the information content, and by extension, a reduction of the computational power. Put simply, it is far more computationally effective to track and compute the location and momentum of a single object in space, than numerous objects. Therefore, it appears that the gravitational attraction is just another optimising mechanism in a computational process that has the role to compress information.""

Under a Rs 6.04 crore (585,000 Swiss francs) pilot project, as many as 48 solar panels have been placed on a 100-metre portion of railway tracks in Buttes, a small village in western Switzerland.
The technology has been developed by Sun-Ways after its founder, Joseph Scuderi, first had the idea in 2020 while waiting for a train. After receiving a green light from the Federal Office of Transport (FOT), the startup deployed the solar panels on the railway line, currently being operated by transN.
""We installed solar panels as we would on the roof of a house,"" Mr Scuderi toldSwissinfo, adding that getting this far ""has been a miracle"".
Notably, the project was initially rejected by FOT in 2023 over concerns that the solar panels could affect the safety of the trains and related maintenance efforts. However, Sun-Ways consulted experts to conduct an independent study on the proposal to prove that the specialised solar panels would not interfere with the active railway.
While solar panels are usually permanently fixed, Sun-Ways has developed a proprietary technology where the panels can be removed whenever required so that the track maintenance team can perform its job. Swiss track maintenance company Scheuchzer can place and remove nearly 1,000 square metres of solar panels in just a few hours.

As per the company, the photovoltaic current produced by the solar panels could be used in three ways. In the first scenario, the energy could be ""reinjected"" to power the railway infrastructure (switches, signals, stations) while in second instance, the current can be fed into the electricity network of the nearest local GRD (Distribution Network Operator).
However, Sun-Ways claims that reinjecting the current into the traction energy network that powers the locomotives is the best way to extract the full benefits of the pilot programme. Sun-Ways says the approximately 5,320 kilometres of the Swiss rail network could generate one billion kWh of solar power per year, which is enough to fulfil the consumption demand of 300,000 households.
""It is good that rail and public transport companies are innovating, including in renewable energy production,"" said Florence Pictet, spokesperson for the FOT.
Sun-Ways says it has already received interest from countries such as China and the US while collaborating on similar projects in South Korea, Spain and Romania.

UK Scientist Makes Bold Claim,"Tue, 29 Apr 2025 11:30:34 +0530","Are we living in a simulated reality like in the movie'The Matrix'?Dr. Melvin Vopson, a UK-based physicist, suggests that gravity might be evidence we're living in a virtual world, with the universe acting like a giant computer. His theory echoes the 1999 film's concept of a simulated universe, but with a scientific twist.Dr. Vopson's researchsuggests that gravity might be a form of data organisation, similar to computer code compression. He proposes that the universe's tendency to pull objects with mass towards the Earth's core is analogous to how computers optimise data, supporting the idea that our universe could be a simulated or computational construct.
""The universe evolves in a way that the information content in it is compressed, optimised and organised – just as computers and computer code do. Hence, gravity appears to be another process of data compression in a possibly simulated universe,"" he told theDaily Mail.
According to the study, gravity reduces ""information entropy,"" or the amount of information an object holds in a given space. Gravity shapes galaxies, orbits planets around stars, and affects nearby objects' motion. In Dr Vopson's theory, gravity pulls objects together as the universe strives to keep information organised and compressed.
""To put it simply, it is easier to compute all the properties and characteristics of a single object in space, rather than multiple objects. That is why objects in space are pulled together,"" Dr Vopson added.
Dr. Vopson's idea builds on hisprevious workon entropy in information theory, which likely explores how information systems tend to become more disordered or complex over time.
""A super complex universe like ours, if it were a simulation, would require a built-in data optimisation and compression to reduce the computational power and the data storage requirements to run the simulation. This is exactly what we are observing all around us, including in digital data, biological systems, mathematical symmetries and the entire universe,"" heexplained in 2023.
This time, he shifted his focus from biological systems to gravity, exploring its potential connection to information theory and the simulated universe hypothesis.
""My findings in this study fit with the thought that the universe might work like a giant computer, or our reality is a simulated construct. Just like computers try to save space and run more efficiently, the universe might be doing the same. It's a new way to think about gravity – not just as a pull, but as something that happens when the universe is trying to stay organised,"" Mr Vopsonexplained.

According to Forbes, the event took place on Sunday, April 27. The moon blocked 23% of the sun in a partial eclipse, but it was not possible to see this from Earth. The images of the ""lunar transit"" show in its entirety, before a large dark orb - moon - passes by, blocking almost a quarter of the star from view.
NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)is a semi-autonomous spacecraft that points at the sun, allowing almost continuous observation. The satellite was launched in February 2010. Since then, it has observed multiple lunar transits, or eclipses, many of which are not visible from Earth.
According to NASA, there will be another eclipse on May 25 that will cover only four per cent of the sun. Another eclipse is due on July 25, which is expected to cover 62% of the sun.
This is not the first time an eclipse has been seen by SDO or by astronauts in space. According to Forbes, several Apollo astronauts witnessed an eclipse of the sun as they travelled to the moon.

Notably, the last solar eclipse visible from Earth was in March this year, which caused the moon to turn a deep red colour. The phenomenon is known as a Blood Moon, as the same atmospheric effect that causes sunsets to appear red affects the moon.
""A lunar eclipse occurs when the Sun, Earth, and Moon align so that the Moon passes into Earth's shadow. In a total lunar eclipse, the entire Moon falls within the darkest part of Earth's shadow, called the umbra,"" NASA said at the time.
The next solar eclipse visible from Earth will be on September 21. It will be visible from New Zealand, the South Pacific and Antarctica.
A total solar eclipse will take place on August 12, 2026. It will be visible from within a narrow path of totality that passes through eastern Greenland, western Iceland and northern Spain, with totality lasting just over two minutes. The total eclipse is the best kind, during which the moon momentarily blocks out all of the sun, allowing its corona to be seen with the naked eye.

""People haven't got it yet, people haven't understood what's coming,"" warned Mr Hinton in aCBSinterview.
""I'm in the unfortunate position of happening to agree with Elon Musk on this, which is that there's a 10 to 20 per cent chance that these things will take over, but that's just a wild guess,"" he added.
Mr Hinton was referring to the Tesla CEO, who has claimed that AI will become smarter than the entire human race by 2029. Mr Musk is also the chief executive of xAI, the company that developed the AI chatbot Grok.
According to Mr Hinton, AI companies should dedicate a ""third of their computing power"" or significantly more resources to safety research.
""If you look at what the big companies are doing right now, they're lobbying to get less AI regulation. There's hardly any regulation as it is, but they want less,"" Mr Hinton said.

Mr Hinton laid the foundations for machine learning that is powering today's AI-based products and applications. However, the Nobel laureate grew wary of AI's future development and cut ties with his employer, Google, in order to speak more freely on the issue.
""It will be comparable with the industrial revolution. But instead of exceeding people in physical strength, it's going to exceed people in intellectual ability. We have no experience of what it's like to have things smarter than us,"" said Mr Hinton at the time.
""I am worried that the overall consequence of this might be systems more intelligent than us that eventually take control.""
Mr Hinton has been a big advocate of government regulation for the technology, especially given the exceptional pace of development.
Apart from Mr Hinton, Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis has also warned about the perils of AI. In a recent interview, Mr Hassabis said society is not ready for human-level AI, popularly referred to as Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).
The 2024 Nobel Prize in Chemistry winner said AI systems capable of human-level cognitive abilities were only five to ten years away and that such development was keeping him up at night.

According to food researchers at the Technical University of Munich, a mushroom calledAmaropostia stiptica, better known as bitter bracket fungus, is officially the 'most bitter thing in the world', as per a report in theBBC.
The mushroom is widely available in Britain, and despite being extremely bitter, it is not toxic. The researchers extracted three compounds from the mushroom and studied their effect on human taste receptors.
This tree-growing mushroom has a compound that is so potent that an individual would be able to taste a single gram of the substance dissolved in 106 bathtubs of water. Named oligoporin D, this chemical activates specialised bitter receptors in our mouths which also help detect natural poisons.

The study results, published in theJournal of Agricultural and Food Chemistrymay help scientists research how humans evolved to be able to detect bitter tastes and why. Notably, bitter is one of the five basic taste sensations humans have, alongside sweet, sour, salty and savoury, also called ""umami"".
""Our results contribute to expanding our knowledge of the molecular diversity and mode of action of natural bitter compounds,"" said lead researcher Dr Maik Behrens.
""In the long term, insights in this area could enable new applications in food and health research, for example in the development of sensorially appealing foods that positively influence digestion and satiety.""
Prior to the German study, most of the research had centred around how flowering plants can have a bitter taste. However, fewer studies had been done looking at fungi such as mushrooms.
Studies show that sensors for bitter substances are also found in the stomach, intestines, heart and lungs apart from the mouth.
Previous studies have indicated that sensors for bitter substances are not only found in the mouth but also in the stomach, intestines, heart and lungs. Researchers stated that closely analysing compounds derived from fungi like oligoporin D could be key to understanding our complex relationship with bitterness.

Using the Korea Microlensing Telescope Network (KMTNet), an international team of researchers has discovered that super-Earth exoplanets are more common across the universe than previously thought, according to a new study.
By studying light anomalies made by the newly found planet's host star and combining their results with a larger sample from a KMTNet microlensing survey, the team found that super-Earths can exist as far from their host star as our gas giants are from the sun, said Andrew Gould, co-author of the study and professor emeritus of astronomy at The Ohio State University.
""Scientists knew there were more small planets than big planets, but in this study, we were able to show that within this overall pattern, there are excesses and deficits,"" he said. ""It's very interesting.""
While it can be relatively easy to locate worlds that orbit close to their star, planets with wider paths can be difficult to detect.
Still, researchers further estimated that for every three stars, there should be at least one super-Earth present with a Jupiter-like orbital period, suggesting these massive worlds are extremely prevalent across the universe, said Gould, whose early theoretical research helped develop the field of planetary microlensing.
The findings in this study were made via microlensing, an observational effect that occurs when the presence of mass warps the fabric of space-time to a detectable degree.
When a foreground object, such as a star or planet, passes between an observer and a more distant star, light is curved from the source, causing an apparent increase in the object's brightness that can last anywhere from a few hours to several months.

As per a new study published on the preprint serverarXiv, the Great Wall, which is located 10 billion light-years from Earth, could be as large as 15 billion light-years in size, up from the previous estimate of 10 billion light-years long.
Using a recently developed methodology, scientists re-examined the Great Wall, which was first discovered, more than a decade ago.
""Evidence is provided that the Hercules-Corona Borealis Great Wall cluster is larger than previously thought. The extension of this cluster's size does not appear to have been due to statistical variations or sampling biases,"" the study highlighted.
By analysing the gamma-ray bursts that are produced during extreme cosmic events such as the collapse of a supernova, the birth of a black hole, or the collision of two neutron stars, scientists managed to figure out the new length of the Great Wall.
The team examined 542 gamma-ray bursts with known redshifts, which showed that the Great Wall may extend from a redshift of 0.33 to a redshift of 2.43 -- a total distance of around 15 billion light-years
""We also found evidence that the Hercules-Corona Borealis Great Wall is larger than previously identified and that it appears to encompass several smaller clusters,"" it added.

In February this year, scientists claimed to have discovered another large superstructure called Quipu, believed to measure 1.3 billion light-years across, which is over 13,000 times the length of the Milky Way.
As per the study, Quipu is responsible for a ""large part of the gravitational pull that causes the peculiar motion of the Local Group with respect to the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) frame"". However, more information is needed to identify the effects of such a structure on its neighbourhood.
The scientists added that while the superstructure was massive in size currently, it would soon collapse and form independent units.
Studying an object as massive as the Great Wall or Quipu could help scientists broaden their understanding of how galaxies evolve and improve the existing cosmological models.

The Houston-based company has been contracted by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and NASA to fly Group Captain Shukla to the space station next month.
Mr Bhatia, whose parents immigrated from India to New York in 1970, is a former Google executive and a Columbia University graduate.
""The opportunity to work with India on the Axiom-4 mission and its future space ambitions is a dream come true, spanning multiple generations and continents. It is the ultimate honour and responsibility to represent our ancestors and our future generations around the world,"" he told NDTV.
In an official statement, he said that space exploration has inspired him since childhood.
""Leading Axiom Space at this critical inflection point in human spaceflight is the realisation of a lifelong ambition. We are accelerating our investment in next-generation technologies - spacesuits, orbital infrastructure, and microgravity research and manufacturing - and we're actively seeking passionate, visionary engineers, technologists, and entrepreneurs who want to help build humanity's future in space,"" Mr Bhatia, who first worked as Axiom Space's Chief Revenue Officer for four years, said.
It was Mr Bhatia who suggested that the company could help an Indian to fly to space.
""I have almost made it a challenge that if someone tells me something, it's impossible, I will do it just to prove that it's possible, because the reason for doing the impossible is you set the bar for what is possible,"" he said.
""For example, when it was [about] doing the deal with India, people said that's impossible, they're never going to fly, and I was like, I'll just go knock on the door of the embassy. And it's like, you can't do that. And I wasn't going to just knock on the door of the embassy because they told me I couldn't. I actually just showed up and knocked on the door of the embassy,"" he said.
The joint mission got a formal mention when Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited the White House in 2024.
Mr Bhatia said he first heard the calling to work in the space industry when he was three years old and his family visited the Kennedy Space Center.
In the 1990s, he studied computer science at Columbia University with a focus on streaming video. He then worked for ESPN to help launch their first HD streaming of sports online, an innovation that would form the foundation for modern-day streaming services.
He then went on to become the founder and CEO of three of his own companies - Explain Everything, Chatwala, and Kaptur.
He was introduced to Axiom Space for the first time while working for Citi Ventures, Citibank's venture capital arm. He left Citi Ventures for Google and joined Axiom four years later.
Under Mr Bhatia's leadership, Axiom Space will accelerate delivery of the world's first commercial, human-rated space station, leveraging its exclusive authorisation to connect its first module to the International Space Station in 2027.
The Axiom-4 mission crew members are Shubhanshu Shukla (India), Peggy Whitson (US), Slawosz Uznanski-Wisniewski (Poland) and Tibor Kapu (Hungary).

While Ms Whitson, the former NASA astronaut and Axiom Space's Director of Human Spaceflight, will command the commercial mission, Mr Shukla will be the mission pilot.
Slawosz Uznanski-Wisniewski, the European Space Agency project astronaut, and Tibor Kap will be the two mission specialists.
The crew is currently preparing for the flight on the SpaceX Falcon-9 rocket and SpaceX Crew Dragon from Kennedy Space Center in Florida.
Axiom said the mission will ""realise the return"" to human spaceflight for India, Poland, and Hungary, with each nation's first government-sponsored flight in more than 40 years.
While Ax-4 marks these countries' second human spaceflight mission in history, it will be the first time all three nations will execute a mission on board the International Space Station.
On this fully commercial mission, India is paying all the costs for the training and the flight to the ISS. The estimated costs are between $60 and $70 million for the one-off single seat on this private space mission.
India has chosen Group Captain Shukla as the primary astronaut and Group Captain Prasanth Balakrishnan Nair as his backup for the nearly fortnight-long mission.
The partnership between Axiom Space and NASA provided the astronauts with comprehensive instruction and guidance for their mission, leveraging the expertise and resources of both organisations.

These medications, known as GLP-1 drugs, mimic a natural hormone that regulates blood sugar and appetite. However, studies suggest they may also affect parts of the brain related to dopamine, a chemical linked to feelings of pleasure and reward.
According to the research that was published in thejournal Current Neuropharmacology, GLP-1 drugs may disrupt dopamine levels, potentially leading to depression and suicidal thoughts in individuals with low dopamine function. While these medications show promise in treating obesity and diabetes, further investigation is needed to understand their potential impact on mental health.
As per anews release, the study, led by researchers across the United States, Brazil, Iran, and Israel, demonstrates that while GLP1 agonists benefit individuals with hyperdopaminergia (excess dopamine activity), they may have harmful effects on individuals with hypodopaminergia (low dopamine function). The authors found genetic associations between GLP1 receptor agonists and genes such as DRD3, BDNF, and CREB1, which are implicated in mood regulation and reward pathways. Their findings suggest that chronic use of these drugs could dysregulate dopamine signalling, potentially leading to depressive symptoms, mood disturbances, and SI.
While the idea of GLP-1 agonism induction of depression and SI is controversial with both negative and positive reporting, based on the evidence presented in this article by Alireza Sharafshah, a PhD candidate from the Cellular and Molecular Research Centre, School of Medicine, Guilan University of Medical Sciences, Rasht, Iran, the authors caution against promoting chronic stimulation via GLP-1 agonists.
""This study should not be ignored, despite the hype surrounding the positive clinical outcomes of GLP-1 receptor agonists,"" said senior author Dr Kenneth Blum, research professor at Western University Health Sciences and Ariel University. ""We urge the clinical prescribing community to proceed with caution to avoid another tragic wave of 'people dying to lose weight'.""
Dr Mark S Gold, an addiction psychiatry pioneer and co-author, emphasised, ""The paper provides critical evidence for re-evaluating the widespread use of GLP1 receptor agonists. The FDA and other regulatory agencies should carefully consider our findings when it comes to labelling and monitoring these drugs.""

This connection was more pronounced in men and individuals classified as underweight or overweight, suggesting that the distribution of body fat may play a role in mental well-being.
The findings, published in the prestigiousjournal Nature Metabolismon April 15, 2025, are particularly relevant given the rising rates of anxiety and obesity, highlighting the importance of understanding the underlying biological processes.
""Understanding the link between adipose tissue and anxiety opens up new avenues for research and potential treatments,""says Gregory Steinberg, senior author on the paper and a professor in the Department of Medicine at McMaster.
""Our findings highlight the complex interplay between metabolism and mental health, and we hope this will lead to better outcomes for individuals suffering from anxiety,"" says Steinberg, a Canada Research Chair in Metabolism and Obesity and the co-director of the Centre for Metabolism, Obesity and Diabetes Research at McMaster.
As per anews release,the research team discovered that psychological stress, which triggers the fight or flight response, initiates a process called lipolysis in fat cells. This process leads to the release of fats, which in turn stimulate the release of a hormone called GDF15 from immune cells found in the fat tissue. GDF15 then communicates with the brain, resulting in anxiety.
Researchers came to their conclusion through a series of meticulously designed experiments involving mice. Behavioural tests assessed anxiety-like behaviour, and molecular analyses identified the activated pathways. A clear connection between metabolic changes in adipose tissue and anxiety was established, offering new insights into the interplay between metabolism and mental health.
""These findings open up exciting possibilities for developing new treatments for anxiety by focusing on metabolic pathways,"" says Logan Townsend, first author on the paper and a postdoctoral fellow at McMaster.
""By understanding how stress-induced changes in fat cells can influence anxiety, we can explore innovative therapeutic strategies that target these metabolic processes, potentially offering more effective and targeted relief for individuals suffering from anxiety disorders. Several companies are developing blockers of GDF15 for treating cancer, so it is possible these will find use for anxiety as well,"" says Townsend.

https://www.ndtv.com/science/are-earthquakes-hiding-secret-nuclear-tests-new-study-raises-concerns-8260838,Are Earthquakes Hiding Secret Nuclear Tests? New Study Raises Concerns,"Sat, 26 Apr 2025 12:46:12 +0530","A recent review by seismologists at Los Alamos National Laboratory suggests that some earthquakes might actually be covert underground nuclear tests. The study, led by Joshua Carmichael and published in the Bulletin of the Seismological Society of America, highlights the challenges in distinguishing between natural seismic events and clandestine nuclear explosions.
According to a new review articlepublished in the Bulletin of the Seismological Society of Americathat contradicts the conventional wisdom about explosion ""masking.""
Underground nuclear tests can produce seismic signals similar to those of natural earthquakes, making detection difficult. However, advancements in seismic monitoring techniques, such as analyzing the ratio of compressional (P) waves to shear (S) waves, have improved the ability to differentiate between the two. Explosions typically generate more P-waves relative to S-waves compared to earthquakes.
Thenew analysisby Joshua Carmichael and colleagues at Los Alamos National Laboratory found that advanced signal detector technology that can identify a 1.7-ton buried explosion with a 97% success rate only has a 37% success rate when seismic signals from that explosion are hidden within the seismic waveforms of an earthquake that happens within 100 seconds and about 250 kilometers away from the explosion.
The overlapping waveforms of explosion and earthquake ""obfuscate the ability of even the most sensitive digital signal detectors we have to identify that explosion,""said Carmichael.
The findings could lead experts to reconsider a 2012 report that concluded earthquake signals could not cover up explosion signals. Potential explosion masking by natural seismic signals is a concern for the community of scientists charged with nuclear test monitoring around the globe.
In North Korea, which has held six nuclear tests over the past 20 years, an increase in regional seismic instruments shows that ""there's been a lot more low-magnitude seismicity in the vicinity of test sites than we initially realized,"" Carmichael noted.
The new findings suggest that ""background seismicity in regions where there's any sort of seismicity at all is going to measurably and substantially reduce the probability that we can detect signals from an underground explosion at a test site,"" he added.
The researchers also found that natural signals from earthquake swarms or other repeating seismic events could be similarly hidden by overlapping waveforms. In this case, the masking effect dropped detection from a 92% to a 16% detection rate.
""This may mean that we probably underestimate a lot of the low magnitude seismicity that is sourced during a swarm or an aftershock sequence,"" Carmichael said. ""In other words, we could be largely undercounting the number of earthquakes that occur in these swarms or in certain aftershock sequences.""
Explosion masking has been difficult to test because there are so few explosions to examine, and very few data sets that contain both explosion and natural seismic signals.

https://www.ndtv.com/science/what-if-you-could-live-forever-scientists-explore-quantum-immortality-8256399,What If You Could Live Forever? Scientists Explore Quantum Immortality,"Fri, 25 Apr 2025 20:50:51 +0530","Scientists have proposed a mind-bending concept known as quantum immortality, which suggests that our consciousness may never truly die but instead shift to an alternate reality upon encountering death. This theory is based on physicist Hugh Everett's many-worlds theory, which proposes the existence of multiple parallel universes.
According to researchers, every time we face death in one universe, our consciousness would supposedly transfer to another universe where we survive. This raises intriguing possibilities, including the notion that we may have experienced multiple catastrophic events without being aware of them.
A recent online video by TikTok user @joli.artist has sparked discussion about quantum immortality, with some users exploring its implications and potential consequences. Physicists Frank Pollman and Ruben Verresen have also contributed to the discussion, suggesting that strong interactions can stop decay entirely and lead to sustained oscillations between decay and rebirth.
""Until now, the assumption was that quasiparticles in interacting quantum systems decay after a certain time,""said physicist Frank Pollmanof the Technical University of Munich back in June 2019.
""We now know that the opposite is the case: strong interactions can even stop decay entirely.""
""The result of the elaborate simulation: admittedly, quasiparticles do decay; however, new, identical particle entities emerge from the debris,""said physicist Ruben Verresenof the Technical University of Munich and the Max Planck Institute for the Physics of Complex Systems.
""If this decay proceeds very quickly, an inverse reaction will occur after a certain time, and the debris will converge again. This process can recur endlessly, and a sustained oscillation between decay and rebirth emerges.""
While the concept of quantum immortality is still speculative, it challenges traditional notions of mortality and the nature of consciousness. Further research is needed to fully understand the implications of this theory.

https://www.ndtv.com/science/what-if-everything-you-know-about-time-is-wrong-new-study-reveals-shocking-possibility-8255116,What If Everything You Know About Time Is Wrong? New Study Reveals Shocking Possibility,"Fri, 25 Apr 2025 18:15:47 +0530","A new study by the University of Surrey suggests that time might not be as linear as we think. Researchers propose that, at the quantum level, time could flow in both forward and backward directions simultaneously. This theory challenges our traditional understanding of time's arrow, which assumes time moves irreversibly from past to future.
In a paper published in thejournal Scientific Reports,findings indicate that certain quantum systems can have two arrows of time, one moving forward and another backward. This raises the astonishing possibility that time could be flowing in reverse all around us, and we might not even be aware of it. The discovery could revolutionize our understanding of thermodynamics, quantum mechanics, and the universe's creation.
""Microscopically speaking, if you think about the arrow of time, we essentially rely on proxies,""says the paper's senior author,Andrea Rocco, PhD, associate professor of physics and mathematical biology at the University of Surrey. At the subatomic level where quantum mechanics operates, we can't always see obvious changes that indicate time's passage. Instead, we need to look at other indicators, like entropy.
Dr Andrea Rocco, Associate Professor in Physics and Mathematical Biology at the University of Surrey and lead author of the study, said, ""One way to explain this is when you look at a process like spilled milk spreading across a table, it's clear that time is moving forward. But if you were to play that in reverse, like a movie, you'd immediately know something was wrong-it would be hard to believe milk could just gather back into a glass.
""However, there are processes, such as the motion of a pendulum, that look just as believable in reverse. The puzzle is that, at the most fundamental level, the laws of physics resemble the pendulum; they do not account for irreversible processes.
""Our findings suggest that while our common experience tells us that time only moves one way, we are just unaware that the opposite direction would have been equally possible.""
The study explored how a quantum system-the world of the sub-atomic-interacts with its environment, known as an ""open quantum system.""

https://www.ndtv.com/science/study-links-extra-15-minutes-of-sleep-to-improved-cognitive-function-in-adolescents-8254345,Study Links Extra 15 Minutes Of Sleep To Improved Cognitive Function In Adolescents,"Fri, 25 Apr 2025 16:47:19 +0530","New research suggests that even a small increase in sleep duration can have a positive impact on cognitive abilities in young people. The study, involving 3,222 adolescents aged 9 to 14, found that those with slightly better sleep habits (averaging 7 hours, 25 minutes per night) showed noticeable improvements in reading, problem-solving, and focus compared to those with the worst sleep habits (averaging 7 hours, 10 minutes). While there was little difference in academic achievement between the groups, the cognitive benefits of even 15 extra minutes of sleep highlight the importance of sleep quality for adolescent brain development.
""Even though the differences in the amount of sleep that each group got was relatively small, at just over a quarter-of-an-hour between the best and worst sleepers, we could still see differences in brain structure and activity and in how well they did at tasks,""says clinical neuropsychologist Barbara Sahakianfrom the University of Cambridge.
""This drives home to us just how important it is to have a good night's sleep at this important time in life.""
First author Dr Qing Ma from Fudan University said: ""Although our study can't answer conclusively whether young people have better brain function and perform better at tests because they sleep better, there are a number of studies that would support this idea. For example, research has shown the benefits of sleep on memory, especially on memory consolidation, which is important for learning.""
The researchers also assessed the participants' heart rates, finding that Group Three had the lowest heart rates across the sleep states and Group One the highest. Lower heart rates are usually a sign of better health, whereas higher rates often accompany poor sleep quality like restless sleep, frequent awakenings and excessive daytime sleepiness.

The project is part of a Rs 567 crore (50 million pound) government-funded programme under which several small-scale experiments will be conducted to assess the potential of the technology, according to a report inThe Telegraph.
The Advanced Research and Invention Agency (Aria) is backing the solar geoengineering project, which has piqued the interest of scientists worldwide.
""We have strong requirements around the length of time experiments can run for and their reversibility and we won't be funding the release of any toxic substances to the environment,"" said Professor Mark Symes, the programme director for Aria.
One of the experiments involves releasing tiny particles into the stratosphere to reflect sunlight. Another potential solution is marine cloud brightening in which ""ships would spray sea-salt particles into the sky to enhance the reflectivity of low-lying clouds"".
If successful, it could temporarily reduce surface temperatures, delaying the climate crisis and giving more time for the deep cuts in global carbon emissions needed. However, geoengineering projects that seek to artificially alter the climate have proven controversial, with critics arguing that they could have damaging knock-on effects.
Additionally, scientists warn that focusing on these experiments could reduce the drive to tackle the root cause of the climate emergency -- the burning of fossil fuels.

Despite the backlash, Mr Symes is of the view that Earth was reaching a series of tipping points and such experiments were necessary to arrest the slide.
""The uncomfortable truth is that our current warming trajectory makes a number of such tipping points distinctly possible over the next century,"" said Mr Symes.
""This has driven increased interest in approaches that might actively cool the world in a short timeframe in order to avoid those tipping points.""
Apart from outdoor experiments, Aria will be funding new modelling studies, indoor tests, climate monitoring and gauging public attitudes to geoengineering.

In an interview withTime, Mr Hassabis was quizzed about what keeps him up at night, to which he talked about AGI, which was in the final steps of becoming reality.
The 2024 Nobel Prize in Chemistry winner said AI systems capable of human-level cognitive abilities were only five to ten years away.
""For me, it's this question of international standards and cooperation and also not just between countries, but also between companies and researchers as we get towards the final steps of AGI. And I think we are on the cusp of that. Maybe we are five to 10 years out. Some people say shorter, I wouldn't be surprised,"" said Mr Hassabis.
""It's a sort of like probability distribution. But it's coming, either way it's coming very soon and I'm not sure society's quite ready for that yet. And we need to think that through and also think about these issues that I talked about earlier, to do with the controllability of these systems and also the access to these systems and ensuring that all goes well,"" he added.
Sir Demis Hassabis on what keeps him up at night: As we approach ""the final steps toward AGI,"" safety still matters -- but it's coordination that haunts him.""It's coming… and I'm not sure society's ready.""How will countries, companies, and labs align before it's too late?pic.twitter.com/W0WZRmcaM8
This is not the first instance when Mr Hassabis has warned about the perils of AGI. He has previously batted for a UN-like umbrella organisation to oversee AGI's development.
""I would advocate for a kind of CERN for AGI, and by that, I mean a kind of international research focused high-end collaboration on the frontiers of AGI development to try and make that as safe as possible,"" said Mr Hassabis in February.
""You would also have to pair it with a kind of an institute like IAEA, to monitor unsafe projects and sort of deal with those. And finally, some kind of supervening body that involves many countries around the world. So a kind of like UN umbrella, something that is fit for purpose for that, a technical UN,"" he added.

The assessment by the Google executive comes in the backdrop of DeepMind publishing aresearch paperearlier this month, warning that AGI may ""permanently destroy humanity"".
""Given the massive potential impact of AGI, we expect that it too could pose potential risk of severe harm,"" the study highlighted, adding that existential risks that ""permanently destroy humanity"" are clear examples of severe harm.
AGI takes AI a step further. While AI is task-specific, AGI aims to possess intelligence that can be applied across a wide range of tasks, similar to human intelligence. In essence, AGI would be a machine with the ability to understand, learn, and apply knowledge in diverse domains, much like a human being.

Named WD 1856+534 b, the exoplanet is a gas giant, located 81 light-years from Earth and sheds light on how planets evolve during the final stages of a star's life.
While the exoplanet was first spotted in 2020, an international team of researchers last week published their findings about it. Using the Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) aboard the JWST, the scientists stated that temperatures reached a frigid -125 degrees Fahrenheit (-87 degrees Celsius), making it the coldest planet ever directly observed.
""We were all a bit surprised - and excited - to find that it was, in fact, a planet, and a really cold one at that,"" Mary Anne Limbach, an astronomer at the University of Michigan, who led the new study toldSpace.com.
The previous record for the coldest planet was held by Epsilon Indi Ab, which stands at around 35 degrees Fahrenheit (2 degrees Celsius).
""The detection of WD 1856 b, with its sub-200 K temperature, marks significant progress in directly detecting exoplanets with thermal emission similar in temperature to Solar System gas giants,"" thestudyhighlighted.

The researchers further confirmed that the exoplanet has a mass no greater than six times that of Jupiter and orbits the remnant core of a once sun-like star, every 1.4 days. Scientists added that it was the first intact exoplanet to have been found in the forbidden zone of a star.
""WD 1856+534 b is now the first intact exoplanet confirmed within a white dwarf's ""forbidden zone,"" a region where planets would have been engulfed during the star's red giant phase. Its presence provides direct evidence that planetary migration into close orbits-including the habitable zone-around white dwarfs is possible.""
Ms Limbach said their findings provide ""compelling evidence"" that not only can planets survive the violent death of their star but also move into orbits where previously they would have not expected them to exist.
Buoyed by the success, the researchers are hoping that JWST's full potential could be used to directly image even colder gas giants in closer systems with ""temperatures as low as 75 K"".
This capability could provide an opportunity to explore the atmospheres and thermal properties of planets with temperatures comparable to the coldest gas giants in our Solar System.

The Axiom-4 space mission of four crew members will conduct research which may pave the way for diabetics to be included in the global astronaut corps. The study will be undertaken in micro-gravity conditions of the International Space Station during the fortnight-long mission.
The experiment is called the ""Suite Ride"" initiative, and the effort marks a significant milestone in the long-term goal of supporting future astronauts with insulin-dependent diabetes (IDDM), a condition historically deemed disqualifying for spaceflight.
The experiment is part of Axiom Space's multi-tiered approach, which aims to eventually demonstrate that astronauts with IDDM can be safely monitored, treated, and participate in off-planet missions.
One person who will be keenly watching this experiment is India's Science Minister, Dr Jitendra Singh, a well-known diabetologist.
The principal investigator for the study, Dr. Mohammad Fityan, Chief Medical Officer at Burjeel Holdings, Abu Dhabi, confirmed that no astronaut will be injected with insulin, but the crew will wear glucose monitoring equipment on the space flight to see how blood glucose levels fluctuate in the 'stressful environment of space'.
They will be validating blood glucose monitoring, data transmission, as well as insulin viability aboard the International Space Station, he added.
According to a 2024 World Health Organisation estimate, 14% of adults aged 18 years and older were living with diabetes, an increase from 7% in 1990, and about 830 million people worldwide have diabetes.
India is considered the diabetes capital of the world. WHO figures suggest there are an estimated 77 million people above the age of suffering from diabetes (type 2) in India, and nearly 25 million are pre-diabetics, i.e, those at a higher risk of developing diabetes in the future.
Burjeel Holdings PLC, a leading super-speciality healthcare provider in the Middle East and the North African region with headquarters in Abu Dhabi, which is spearheading the project, said, They will do groundbreaking mission-focused work on diabetes management in microgravity, along with Axiom Space.
A pivotal moment in this research was the successful technical demonstration conducted on the Galactic 07 mission of 2024, which confirmed that commercially available insulin pens can deliver medication effectively in microgravity, adhering to International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO) guidelines. The promising results have laid the foundation for the upcoming mission that will take place in space.
The Axiom-4 (Ax-4) mission will utilise Continuous Glucose Monitors (CGMs), which have become the standard for glucose monitoring in individuals with diabetes. These devices will be tested to ensure their accuracy in microgravity, providing real-time data that will ultimately support the health of astronauts with insulin-dependent diabetes.
The comprehensive preflight, inflight, and post-flight protocols will employ various testing methods to validate these technologies. The Ax-4 mission also plans to look at insulin exposure in microgravity to assess the potency and stability of the drug product upon its return to Earth.
Testing the behaviour of CGMs and insulin delivery technologies in microgravity and with circadian rhythm disruption is expected to advance the understanding of how such innovations can improve diabetes monitoring and care in remote or underserved areas on Earth. Experts say this research will lay the groundwork for managing diabetes in isolated locations, such as oil rigs, deserts, or rural regions.
Dr Fityan said, ""Space is a proving ground, as this research aims to provide invaluable data that will directly benefit underserved communities and difficult-to-reach areas across the globe.""
Dr Lucie Low, Chief Scientist, Axiom Space, said, ""This may pave the way for the eventual flight of an astronaut with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus IDDM. The successful demonstration of glucose monitoring on subjects without diabetes will next open the door to flying astronauts with non-insulin-dependent Type 2 diabetes, looking to prove that people with diabetes can one day thrive in the unique environment of space.""
Dr. Low added that ""I am personally very excited about our 'Suite Ride' experiment because for Axiom, it means that we are enabling new opportunities for a more diverse crew to fly a future, as well as translating those results back into, hopefully, impacts for diabetic patients here on Earth.""

For 18 years, starting in 2001, California-based Tim Friede got himself knowingly bitten by some of the most venomous snakes on the planet in hopes of finding a cure for all snake bites.
According to a report inCNN, antibodies found in Mr Friede's blood have now been shown to protect against fatal doses from a wide range of species in animal tests.
Immunologist Jacob Glanville first heard about Mr Friede through media reports in 2017 and decided that there was an opportunity to do something groundbreaking.
""We had this conversation. And I said, I know it's awkward, but I'm really interested in looking at some of your blood,"" said Mr Glanville. ""And he [Tim Friede] said, 'Finally, I've been waiting for this call.'""
As the pair began working together, Mr Friede donated a 40-millilitre blood sample to Mr Glanville and his colleagues. Eight years later, Mr Glanville and Peter Kwong, Richard J. Stock, Professor of medical sciences at Columbia University's Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons havepublisheddetails of the antivenom that can protect against the bites from 19 species of poisonous snakes.
Currently, antivenom is made by injecting small doses of snake venom into animals, such as horses. Once the immune system fights the venom and produces the antibodies, scientists harvest them to be used as antivenom. However, venom and antivenom have to be closely matched. For example, antivenom made from snakes in India may not be as effective against the same species in Thailand.

While the antivenom cocktail prepared using MrFriede's blood has not been tested in humans yet, experts predict that the human origin of the antibodies would mean fewer side effects than antivenoms made the traditional way.
""Tim's antibodies are really quite extraordinary - he taught his immune system to get this very, very broad recognition,"" said Prof Kwong.
Notably, Mr Friede gave up on injecting himself with snake venom in 2018 after some close calls. He is now employed by Glanville's biotechnology company Centivax and contributing to the research.

https://www.ndtv.com/science/worlds-largest-solar-telescope-captures-stunning-details-of-suns-surface-8310925,World's Largest Solar Telescope Captures Stunning Details Of Sun's Surface,"Sun, 04 May 2025 08:24:32 +0530","The world's biggest solar telescope has captured the stunning details of the Sun's surface, showing sunspots and intense magnetic activity. The newly released image comes as the Sun moves towards its most active phase of its 11-year solar cycle.
The image was released by Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope in Hawaii.
It is the first image captured with the US National Science Foundation's new Visible Tunable Filter (VTF). The high-resolution photograph, taken in early December, shows a collection of enormous sunspots only 10 kilometres apart in size but spanning thousands of miles. The image showed sunspots, each about the size of a continent on Earth.
Scientists from the International Solar Cycle Prediction Panel, NASA, and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration announced in October that the sun reached the solar maximum or peak of activity. The sun's magnetic poles reverse during the peak, causing more sunspots to show up on its surface.
These sunspots are cooler, active areas on the Sun that can cause big solar explosions like solar flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs). When these solar outbursts take place, they shoot out charged particles into space, and if these particles reach Earth, they can disrupt satellites, cause power outages or affect GPS and phone signals.
Friedrich Woeger, the instrument program scientist at the NSF Inouye Solar Telescope, said, ""A solar storm in the 1800s (the Carrington Event) reportedly was so energetic that it caused fires in telegraph stations. We need to understand the physical drivers of these phenomena and how they can affect our technology and ultimately our lives.""
Mark Miesch, a research scientist at the Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences at the University of Colorado Boulder, said that sunspots were like magnetic plugs blocking some of the heat coming up to the surface. That's the reason they look darker and are cooler than the rest of the Sun's surface, he added.
He compared these sunspots to an oven. ""Even though these sunspots are cooler, they are still hotter than any oven on Earth,"" he added.

Scientists Uncover Potential Weight Loss Solution,"Sat, 03 May 2025 23:04:51 +0530","Scientists have made a groundbreaking discovery that could potentially replace weight loss drugs like Ozempic with a natural alternative. Researchers at Jiangnan University in China have identified a gut microbe, Bacteroides vulgatus, and its metabolites that can naturally regulate blood sugar levels and sugar cravings.
The study, published inNature Microbiology,found that increasing the abundance of this microbe in diabetic mice can stimulate the secretion of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), a hormone that helps regulate blood sugar levels and feelings of fullness.
GLP-1 is a natural hormone produced by the body, and its impaired function is often seen in people with type 2 diabetes. Drugs like Ozempic mimic this natural process, but researchers are now exploring ways to get the body to produce more GLP-1 on its own. The new research suggests that gut microbes like B. vulgatus and their metabolites may play a key role in shaping a person's sweet tooth.
The study found that mice lacking a gut protein called Ffar4 had reduced gut colonies of B. vulgatus, leading to decreased release of a hormone called FGF21, which is tied to sugar cravings. In humans, genetic variants of FGF21 were linked to an increased preference for sweet foods. The research team also found that treating mice with a metabolite of B. vulgatus boosted GLP-1 secretion, which then triggered the secretion of FGF21.
This breakthrough discovery could lead to new ways to manage weight and blood sugar levels naturally, potentially reducing the need for drugs like Ozempic. Further research is needed to explore the potential of this natural alternative.

This innovative method leverages electric field fluctuations to predict and potentially protect critical infrastructure from lightning strikes. With approximately 6,000 lightning bolts striking the ground worldwide every minute, this technology holds promise for revolutionising lightning protection and mitigating damage to cities and infrastructure globally.
Watch the video here:
According toNTT,the technology uses lightning-resistant UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles), such as drones, flying near thunderclouds at high altitudes to attract and guide lightning strikes safely to the ground via conductors, thereby protecting people and equipment from damage. Additionally, the lightning energy is harnessed and stored using compressed air and other charging methods.
NTT's goal is to reduce damage caused by lightning strikes worldwide, with the ultimate aim of absorbing thundercloud energy and eliminating lightning strikes that reach the ground. The company has begun developing the technology to attract lightning strikes with high accuracy and safety, focusing on improving UAV resistance to lightning currents and strong electromagnetic fields. This will enable stable flight even under lightning clouds. Furthermore, NTT aims to convert and store lightning energy into kinetic and magnetic energy, establishing a lightning charging technology.
This technology has the potential to benefit infrastructure companies, including telecommunications and electric power providers, as well as government agencies and local governments, by protecting their facilities from lightning strikes.

As countries strive for carbon neutrality and net-zero emissions, the question remains whether these efforts will be sufficient to restore planetary stability and promote sustainable prosperity.
According to a report published in the sciencejournal Naturetitled""Why the green-technology race might not save the planet,""it highlights concerns that the global race for green technology may not suffice to ensure environmental sustainability. Despite advancements in renewable energy and eco-friendly innovations, the article emphasizes that without addressing overconsumption and implementing systemic changes, these technologies alone may not prevent ecological degradation.
The researchers behind the report argue that while green tech can boost economic prosperity, it must be complemented by global cooperation and policies that prioritize environmental health to truly safeguard the planet's future.
Authors writethat because nature is being underpriced, most economies disregard the increasing costs of ecological scarcity. They don't view natural systems as assets worth conserving, restoring, and protecting through investment. For example, global spending on biodiversity and habitat conservation, protection, and restoration ranges from $124 billion to $143 billion a year. Yet this is only up to one-fifth of what's needed - translating into a biodiversity-financing gap of more than half a trillion dollars.
The pursuit of ""green growth""-the idea that economies can continue to expand while reducing environmental harm-faces challenges such as rebound effects, where efficiency gains lead to increased consumption, and the environmental costs associated with producing green technologies themselves.
Therefore, a holistic approach that combines technological innovation with lifestyle changes and robust environmental policies is essential for achieving long-term planetary health.

Interestingly, the study also found that individuals who have experienced financial hardship exhibit stronger links between improved financial status and prosocial behaviors, suggesting that personal experiences of precarity may enhance generosity.
Patricia Lockwood, Professor of Decision Neuroscience at the University of Birmingham and senior author ofthe study said:""There has been disagreement as to whether higher wealth makes you more or less prosocial. Our study clearly shows that wealth, and a subjective sense of financial well-being, are very strongly associated with prosocial behaviours and attitudes.

Aspergillus, a type of fungus that thrives in warm, damp climates, has the potential to infect millions if it makes its way into the aforementioned regions.
Norman van Rhijn, the study co-author, has warned that the world was approaching a ""tipping point"" where the spread of fungal pathogens could become the norm.
""We're talking about hundreds of thousands of lives, and continental shifts in species distributions. In 50 years, where things grow and what you get infected by is going to be completely different,"" Mr Van Rhijn told theFinancial Times.
As per the study, the species can grow quickly in high temperatures in compost, which explains why it is able to thrive in the 37C internal temperature of the human body. Additionally, fungi's resilience means they can survive and thrive in places that other organisms can't, even inside Chernobyl's nuclear reactors.
While inhaling the fungus's spores does not make everyone ill, those with conditions such as asthma, cystic fibrosis or a weakened immune system remain at risk.

What makes the situation worrisome is the fact that the fungal kingdom is largely unexplored by scientists. Less than 10 per cent of an estimated 1.5 to 3.8 million fungi species have been described, and only a tiny fraction have had their genetic material (genome) sequenced.
""Its lifestyle in the natural environment may have provided Aspergillus fumigatus with the fitness advantage needed to colonise human lungs,"" said Professor Elaine Bignell, co-director at the MRC Centre for Medical Mycology at Exeter University.
The study highlighted thatAspergillus fumigatuscould spread across an additional 77 per cent of territory by the year 2100 as a result of the world's heavy use of fossil fuels. As a result, potentially nine million people in Europe could be exposed to the infection.
While the danger is imminent, scientists say the development of antifungal medicines has been hobbled by the financial unattractiveness of investing in them, because of high costs and doubts over their profitability.

Where, When And How To See It","Mon, 05 May 2025 14:50:48 +0530","Stargazers are in for a treat as the Eta Aquariid meteor shower is set to illuminate the UK skies, peaking on May 6, 2025. Active since April 19, this annual spectacle will continue until May 28, offering a chance to spot ""shooting stars"" and potentially dazzling fireballs. According toNASA, the Eta Aquariids are created by debris from Halley's Comet, and Earth's passage through this trail results in the spectacular meteor display.
Under ideal conditions like dark skies and minimal moonlight, observers can see 10-30 meteors per hour in the Northern Hemisphere and up to 60 in the Southern Hemisphere. The meteors are fast, moving at about 66 km/s, and often leave glowing trails.
About the Meteor Shower
The Eta Aquariid meteors, which peak during early May each year, are notable for their incredible speed, entering Earth's atmosphere at approximately 40.7 miles (65.4 kilometres) per second. This rapid movement can create glowing ""trains"" of incandescent debris that linger for several seconds to minutes after the meteor has passed. During the Eta Aquariids' peak, observers can expect to see around 50 meteors per hour.
The meteor shower will peak the night of Monday (May 5) into the morning hours of Tuesday (May 6), according to NASA. The best time to watch the meteor shower is at 2 am local time on May 6.
""Look away from the Moon, and give your eyes about 30 minutes to adjust to the dark. Avoid looking at bright lights, such as your cell phone, too, as this will take your eyes off the sky and ruin your night vision"", said NASA.
The UK is set for a great view of the Eta Aquariid meteor shower on Sunday night into early Monday morning, with largely clear skies expected across much of the country. However, eastern England and Scotland may experience some patchy cloud, while Shetland and Orkney are likely to see increasing cloud cover, making viewing conditions more challenging,BBC Weatherreported.
Despite the clear skies, it will be a chilly morning, with temperatures ranging from 5 to 7°C in many areas and potentially near freezing in rural locations, accompanied by a fresh north-easterly wind. To make the most of this astronomical event, stargazers should dress warmly, find a dark spot with minimal light pollution, and look towards the eastern sky between midnight and dawn when meteor activity is highest.

https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/astronaut-or-space-tourist-debate-rages-over-who-gets-the-title-8332828,Astronaut Or Space Tourist? Debate Rages Over Who Gets The Title,"Mon, 05 May 2025 11:01:42 +0530","The recent all-women spaceflight carried out on Jeff Bezos's Blue Origin vehicle has raised discussion ofwho gets to be calledan astronaut. Sean Duffy, Donald Trump's transportation secretary,disputed the astronaut titlegiven to those on the flight, including singer Katy Perry and journalist Gayle King.
The term astronaut was only rarely disputed until thefirst ""celebrity"" suborbital flight in 2021. In the 1960s, pilots flying the experimental, rocket-powered X-15 jet wereawarded astronaut statusby the US Air Force if they flew above 50 miles (80km).
Sir Richard Branson's 2021 flight aboard his Virgin Galactic vehicle reached 53 miles (85km) - an altitude recognised by some experts as being within outer space. Bezos followed a few days later,travelling on his Blue OriginNew Shepard vehicle. This flight reached about 68 miles (106km) in altitude.
Bezos has focused on reaching an altitude of about 62.1 miles (100km), one proposed boundary of space known as the Kármán line, named after the early 20th-century polymath Theodore von Kármán.
A 2021post on social mediaby Bezos's Blue Origin capitalised on the fact that his New Shepard vehicle reached the higher boundary. The suggestion from the post was that those who travelled to the lower boundary on rival Virgin Galactic flights could have their ""space traveller"" status questioned, whereas those who travelled with Blue Origin could not.
This particular post did not mention the question of who is an ""astronaut"". However, this is how Blue Origincurrently describesthose who travel on New Shepard.
Indeed, some definitions of ""astronaut"" simply state that it is a person who has been to space. Therefore, another implication of the post - intentional or not - might be that those who travel with Bezos's company are more eligible for such a designation than those who have been to lower altitudes.
While Blue Origin calls the Kármán line an ""internationally recognised boundary"" of space, it is far from universally accepted. Theodore von Kármán wanted to separate out aeronautics (the science of flying aircraft) and astronautics (the science of space travel).
As a byproduct, he calculated the maximum altitude that an aircraft could go without reaching orbital velocity (where it would start orbiting the Earth) to bearound 52 miles (84km).
A researcher and associate of von Kármán calledAndrew Haleywas interested in space law. He established von Kármán's calculation as the boundary of space. This was later raised to 62.1 miles (100km) by the world governing body for air sports, the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale.
The Kármán line has very little scientific rationale, however. If you ask a geologist, an atmospheric scientist and a space physics expert where the definition of space is, you will get vastly different answers.
For example, as somebody who specialises in magnetospheric physics and solar influence, I would say space properly startsat the plasmapause. This is a boundary around the Earth that's based on differences in the charged particles that exist on either side of the division. The plasmapause sits at an altitude of around 35,000 miles (57,000km).
The recent Blue Origin flight understandably made a strong positive impression on the passengers. Gayle King compared the flight to the historic launch in 1961 that made Nasa astronaut Alan Shepard the first American in space.
The effusive reactions from the passengers, along with King's and Blue Origin's use of the term ""astronaut"" to describe the team memberspromptedabacklashonline. King noted that men on similar flights hadn't been subjected to such criticism, and Katy Perry saysshe felt""battered and bruised"" by the reaction.
Among the criticswas the US transport secretary, Sean Duffy, who stated that the participants could not be astronauts as they failed to meet theFederal Aviation Administration (FAA) astronaut criteria. The FAA requirements for an astronaut are for them to be a member of crew, to contribute to spaceflight safety and to demonstrate activities essential to public safety. Their minimum altitude for ""space"" is the 50 mile (80km) limit.
As New Shepard isfully automated, none of the passengers could really be considered ""crew members"". Similarly, if you buy a ticket on a plane, you are not crew unless employed by the airline to do a job.
Would it be different if private space travellers were able to carry out scientific research during their journey? This might make them more than just passengers and potentially qualify them for the ""crew"" designation. Blue Origin and Virgin Galactic are actually not suited for any sort of weightlessness research. Passengers experience around 3-4 minutes of weightlessness.
By contrast, a flight on theAirbus A310 zero-Gplane gives 25-30 seconds of weightlessness. When this is repeated 25-30 times, you get between 10 and 15 minutes of weightlessness in total. This avenue for carrying out research in microgravity is also open to anybody with a sensible scientific idea to test rather than just members of the rich elite.
Does it matter what space travellers actually call themselves? The FAA designation of ""astronaut"" is not the only one. Some dictionary definitions simply define an astronaut as a persontrained to go into spaceor, as mentioned, a person who hasflown in space. The passengers on Blue Origin's New Shepard flights would probably qualify under both of these definitions.
But let's consider the legal dimension. Star Trek actorWilliam Shatner flew with Blue Originon a New Shepard vehicle in 2021. If Shatner had experienced a health-related incident during the flight, who would have been at fault?
If Shatner was an ""astronaut"", could it be argued that he held a greater level of responsibility for any adverse effects from the flight? If he was simply a passenger, might the company share more responsibility?
Thankfully, such a situation has not yet occurred, which means that any associated legal arguments remain hypothetical. But as more paying passengers travel on flights to space, the chances of adverse incidents increase.
Ultimately, everyone can have an opinion about whether just going into space - wherever the boundary may lie - makes you an astronaut. But there may be more to consider than a nice title.

Aspergillus, a type of fungus that thrives in warm, damp climates, has the potential to infect millions if it makes its way into the aforementioned regions.
Norman van Rhijn, the study co-author, has warned that the world was approaching a ""tipping point"" where the spread of fungal pathogens could become the norm.
""We're talking about hundreds of thousands of lives, and continental shifts in species distributions. In 50 years, where things grow and what you get infected by is going to be completely different,"" Mr Van Rhijn told theFinancial Times.
As per the study, the species can grow quickly in high temperatures in compost, which explains why it is able to thrive in the 37C internal temperature of the human body. Additionally, fungi's resilience means they can survive and thrive in places that other organisms can't, even inside Chernobyl's nuclear reactors.
While inhaling the fungus's spores does not make everyone ill, those with conditions such as asthma, cystic fibrosis or a weakened immune system remain at risk.

What makes the situation worrisome is the fact that the fungal kingdom is largely unexplored by scientists. Less than 10 per cent of an estimated 1.5 to 3.8 million fungi species have been described, and only a tiny fraction have had their genetic material (genome) sequenced.
""Its lifestyle in the natural environment may have provided Aspergillus fumigatus with the fitness advantage needed to colonise human lungs,"" said Professor Elaine Bignell, co-director at the MRC Centre for Medical Mycology at Exeter University.
The study highlighted thatAspergillus fumigatuscould spread across an additional 77 per cent of territory by the year 2100 as a result of the world's heavy use of fossil fuels. As a result, potentially nine million people in Europe could be exposed to the infection.
While the danger is imminent, scientists say the development of antifungal medicines has been hobbled by the financial unattractiveness of investing in them, because of high costs and doubts over their profitability.

https://www.ndtv.com/science/eta-aquarid-meteor-shower-to-dazzle-stargazers-where-when-and-how-to-see-it-8334463,"Eta Aquarid Meteor Shower To Dazzle Stargazers. Where, When And How To See It","Mon, 05 May 2025 14:50:48 +0530","Stargazers are in for a treat as the Eta Aquariid meteor shower is set to illuminate the UK skies, peaking on May 6, 2025. Active since April 19, this annual spectacle will continue until May 28, offering a chance to spot ""shooting stars"" and potentially dazzling fireballs. According toNASA, the Eta Aquariids are created by debris from Halley's Comet, and Earth's passage through this trail results in the spectacular meteor display.
Under ideal conditions like dark skies and minimal moonlight, observers can see 10-30 meteors per hour in the Northern Hemisphere and up to 60 in the Southern Hemisphere. The meteors are fast, moving at about 66 km/s, and often leave glowing trails.
About the Meteor Shower
The Eta Aquariid meteors, which peak during early May each year, are notable for their incredible speed, entering Earth's atmosphere at approximately 40.7 miles (65.4 kilometres) per second. This rapid movement can create glowing ""trains"" of incandescent debris that linger for several seconds to minutes after the meteor has passed. During the Eta Aquariids' peak, observers can expect to see around 50 meteors per hour.
The meteor shower will peak the night of Monday (May 5) into the morning hours of Tuesday (May 6), according to NASA. The best time to watch the meteor shower is at 2 am local time on May 6.
""Look away from the Moon, and give your eyes about 30 minutes to adjust to the dark. Avoid looking at bright lights, such as your cell phone, too, as this will take your eyes off the sky and ruin your night vision"", said NASA.
The UK is set for a great view of the Eta Aquariid meteor shower on Sunday night into early Monday morning, with largely clear skies expected across much of the country. However, eastern England and Scotland may experience some patchy cloud, while Shetland and Orkney are likely to see increasing cloud cover, making viewing conditions more challenging,BBC Weatherreported.
Despite the clear skies, it will be a chilly morning, with temperatures ranging from 5 to 7°C in many areas and potentially near freezing in rural locations, accompanied by a fresh north-easterly wind. To make the most of this astronomical event, stargazers should dress warmly, find a dark spot with minimal light pollution, and look towards the eastern sky between midnight and dawn when meteor activity is highest.

https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/astronaut-or-space-tourist-debate-rages-over-who-gets-the-title-8332828,Astronaut Or Space Tourist? Debate Rages Over Who Gets The Title,"Mon, 05 May 2025 11:01:42 +0530","The recent all-women spaceflight carried out on Jeff Bezos's Blue Origin vehicle has raised discussion ofwho gets to be calledan astronaut. Sean Duffy, Donald Trump's transportation secretary,disputed the astronaut titlegiven to those on the flight, including singer Katy Perry and journalist Gayle King.
The term astronaut was only rarely disputed until thefirst ""celebrity"" suborbital flight in 2021. In the 1960s, pilots flying the experimental, rocket-powered X-15 jet wereawarded astronaut statusby the US Air Force if they flew above 50 miles (80km).
Sir Richard Branson's 2021 flight aboard his Virgin Galactic vehicle reached 53 miles (85km) - an altitude recognised by some experts as being within outer space. Bezos followed a few days later,travelling on his Blue OriginNew Shepard vehicle. This flight reached about 68 miles (106km) in altitude.
Bezos has focused on reaching an altitude of about 62.1 miles (100km), one proposed boundary of space known as the Kármán line, named after the early 20th-century polymath Theodore von Kármán.
A 2021post on social mediaby Bezos's Blue Origin capitalised on the fact that his New Shepard vehicle reached the higher boundary. The suggestion from the post was that those who travelled to the lower boundary on rival Virgin Galactic flights could have their ""space traveller"" status questioned, whereas those who travelled with Blue Origin could not.
This particular post did not mention the question of who is an ""astronaut"". However, this is how Blue Origincurrently describesthose who travel on New Shepard.
Indeed, some definitions of ""astronaut"" simply state that it is a person who has been to space. Therefore, another implication of the post - intentional or not - might be that those who travel with Bezos's company are more eligible for such a designation than those who have been to lower altitudes.
While Blue Origin calls the Kármán line an ""internationally recognised boundary"" of space, it is far from universally accepted. Theodore von Kármán wanted to separate out aeronautics (the science of flying aircraft) and astronautics (the science of space travel).
As a byproduct, he calculated the maximum altitude that an aircraft could go without reaching orbital velocity (where it would start orbiting the Earth) to bearound 52 miles (84km).
A researcher and associate of von Kármán calledAndrew Haleywas interested in space law. He established von Kármán's calculation as the boundary of space. This was later raised to 62.1 miles (100km) by the world governing body for air sports, the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale.
The Kármán line has very little scientific rationale, however. If you ask a geologist, an atmospheric scientist and a space physics expert where the definition of space is, you will get vastly different answers.
For example, as somebody who specialises in magnetospheric physics and solar influence, I would say space properly startsat the plasmapause. This is a boundary around the Earth that's based on differences in the charged particles that exist on either side of the division. The plasmapause sits at an altitude of around 35,000 miles (57,000km).
The recent Blue Origin flight understandably made a strong positive impression on the passengers. Gayle King compared the flight to the historic launch in 1961 that made Nasa astronaut Alan Shepard the first American in space.
The effusive reactions from the passengers, along with King's and Blue Origin's use of the term ""astronaut"" to describe the team memberspromptedabacklashonline. King noted that men on similar flights hadn't been subjected to such criticism, and Katy Perry saysshe felt""battered and bruised"" by the reaction.
Among the criticswas the US transport secretary, Sean Duffy, who stated that the participants could not be astronauts as they failed to meet theFederal Aviation Administration (FAA) astronaut criteria. The FAA requirements for an astronaut are for them to be a member of crew, to contribute to spaceflight safety and to demonstrate activities essential to public safety. Their minimum altitude for ""space"" is the 50 mile (80km) limit.
As New Shepard isfully automated, none of the passengers could really be considered ""crew members"". Similarly, if you buy a ticket on a plane, you are not crew unless employed by the airline to do a job.
Would it be different if private space travellers were able to carry out scientific research during their journey? This might make them more than just passengers and potentially qualify them for the ""crew"" designation. Blue Origin and Virgin Galactic are actually not suited for any sort of weightlessness research. Passengers experience around 3-4 minutes of weightlessness.
By contrast, a flight on theAirbus A310 zero-Gplane gives 25-30 seconds of weightlessness. When this is repeated 25-30 times, you get between 10 and 15 minutes of weightlessness in total. This avenue for carrying out research in microgravity is also open to anybody with a sensible scientific idea to test rather than just members of the rich elite.
Does it matter what space travellers actually call themselves? The FAA designation of ""astronaut"" is not the only one. Some dictionary definitions simply define an astronaut as a persontrained to go into spaceor, as mentioned, a person who hasflown in space. The passengers on Blue Origin's New Shepard flights would probably qualify under both of these definitions.
But let's consider the legal dimension. Star Trek actorWilliam Shatner flew with Blue Originon a New Shepard vehicle in 2021. If Shatner had experienced a health-related incident during the flight, who would have been at fault?
If Shatner was an ""astronaut"", could it be argued that he held a greater level of responsibility for any adverse effects from the flight? If he was simply a passenger, might the company share more responsibility?
Thankfully, such a situation has not yet occurred, which means that any associated legal arguments remain hypothetical. But as more paying passengers travel on flights to space, the chances of adverse incidents increase.
Ultimately, everyone can have an opinion about whether just going into space - wherever the boundary may lie - makes you an astronaut. But there may be more to consider than a nice title.

Earlier this year, in February, JWST's observations led by Louis-Philippe Coulombe, a graduate student at Universite de Montreal's Trottier Institute for Research on Exoplanets (IREx), revealed key details about its atmosphere.
Observations by Coulombe, published inNature Astronomy, revealed that this rare exoplanet orbits its G-type star, LTT 9779, in less than a day (probably 19 hours), and it is tidally locked (just like Earth's Moon), which means that one side always faces its star while the other remains in darkness.
With temperatures reaching almost 2,000 degrees Celsius on its dayside, LTT 9779 is one of the few known planets in the ""hot Neptune desert"", where Neptunian planets aren't found that often.

As per a recentpress release, LTT-9779 b survives where only a few planets can. It maintains a carbon-rich atmosphere in a region where hot Neptune-class worlds are expected to evaporate, hence, scientists are stunned over its existence.
""This makes LTT-9779 b a valuable laboratory for studying atmospheric escape and chemical processes under extreme conditions, offering new insight into the survival of planets in the hot Neptune desert,"" the presser added.
As per the Coulombe team's discovery, the exoplanet's dayside hosts reflective clouds on its cooler western hemisphere as it manages to create a striking contrast to the hotter eastern side.
In another fascinating detail, the scientists discovered clouds made of materials like silicate minerals, which form on the slightly cooler western side of the planet's dayside.

The presser mentioned that these reflective clouds help explain why this planet is so bright at visible wavelengths, bouncing back much of the star's light.
In an update about the planet's composition, the study also detected water vapour in the atmosphere. ""By modeling LTT 9779 b's atmosphere in detail, we're starting to unlock the processes driving its alien weather patterns,"" said Coulombe's research advisor Bjorn Benneke, an UdeM professor of astronomy and co-author of the study.
Officially named Cuancoa, LTT 9779 b is an ultra-hot Neptune, with a mass about 29 times that of Earth. ""Finding a planet of this size so close to its host star is like finding a snowball that hasn't melted in a fire,"" said Coulombe in a press release. ""It's a testament to the diversity of planetary systems and offers a window into how planets evolve under extreme conditions.""
The scientists said that this rare planetary system continues to challenge scientists' understanding of how planets form, migrate, and endure in the face of unrelenting stellar forces.

The photo taken by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) for the first time shows the full extent of the nebula's lobes, shown in blue colour. These lobes are closed, bubble-like structures that each extend about three light-years. They look like giant 'legs' of the spider, with the European Space Agency (ESA) calling it ""cosmic creepy-crawly"".
The Red Spider Nebula is a breathtaking planetary nebula approximately 3,000 light-years away from Earth. This stunning celestial object is the result of a star's final evolutionary stage, where it sheds its outer layers, creating a shell of gas and dust.
NASA stated that these lobes are traced by light emitted from H2 molecules, which contain two hydrogen atoms bonded together. These huge bubbles have been inflated by the outflowing gas from the centre of the nebula over thousands of years.

As a star like our Sun exhausts its fuel, it expands into a red giant, expelling its outer layers into space. The exposed core, now a white dwarf, emits intense ultraviolet radiation, causing the ejected material to glow, creating the vibrant colours of the planetary nebula.
""Planetary nebulae like this one are made when a Sun-like star reaches the end of its life. After ballooning into a red giant, the star then throws off its outer layers into space, revealing its white-hot core. Ultraviolet light from the central star causes the cast-off material to glow,"" NASA said.
The US-based space agency revealed that the image was captured by NIRCam, James Webb's primary near-infrared imager, which aims to provide high-resolution imaging and spectroscopy for a wide variety of investigations.

""Though we can only see one star - the central star - here, it's possible that there is a companion star, too. Its presence could explain the nebula's shape: the characteristic narrow waist and wide outflows,"" NASA said. The gravitational influence of this unseen partner sculpts the ejected material, creating the nebula's characteristic bipolar form.
The Red Spider Nebula offers a glimpse into the future of our own Sun, which is expected to undergo a similar transformation in about 5 billion years. As the Sun exhausts its fuel, it will expand into a red giant, shedding its outer layers and creating a planetary nebula, leaving behind a white dwarf remnant
As per NASA, this hourglass shape, as seen in the Red Spider Nebula, is also observed in other planetary nebulae such as the Butterfly Nebula, also captured by Webb recently.

Dark matter has been one of astronomy's biggest mysteries for nearly a century. The idea first emerged in the 1930s, when Swiss astronomer Fritz Zwicky realised that galaxies in the distant Coma Cluster were moving far too fast to be held together by the gravity of their visible stars. Decades later, Vera Rubin's studies of spiral galaxies showed that the outer regions rotated just as quickly as their centres - something that only made sense if an unseen mass was providing extra gravitational glue.
Read What A Recent Study Said About Existence Of Dark Matter
To this day, dark matter has never been observed directly. It doesn't emit, absorb or reflect light. In that sense, it behaves a bit like the One Ring inThe Lord of the Rings- powerful, omnipresent, but essentially invisible. Yet scientists believe it makes up about 85 per cent of all matter in the universe, outweighing everything we can see - stars, planets, even our own bodies - according tospace.com.
But a new study led by Prof Tomonori Totani of the University of Tokyo hints that we may finally have caught dark matter in the act.
Totani's team analysed Fermi telescope observations of the Milky Way's centre - the region where dark matter is expected to be densest. They detected a halo-shaped glow of gamma rays at energies of around 20 gigaelectronvolts, an unusually strong signal that neatly matches predictions for a type of hypothetical dark matter particle known as a WIMP (weakly interacting massive particle). In theory, when two WIMPs collide, they annihilate each other, releasing gamma rays - the universe's most energetic form of light.
""The emission closely matches the shape expected from a dark matter halo,"" Totani is quoted as saying byspace.com. He added that no known astronomical phenomena provide an easy alternative explanation.
If the results hold up under scrutiny, this would be the first time humanity has ""seen"" dark matter - not directly with our eyes, but through the energetic fingerprints it leaves behind. It would also point to a brand-new particle outside the Standard Model of physics, placing scientists on the brink of a discovery as transformative as the Higgs boson.
But like every good plot twist - thinkInterstellarorArrival- the scientific community is cautious. More data, and more verification, are needed. For now, dark matter remains partly hidden, but perhaps no longer completely in the dark.

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) Space Weather Prediction Center noted that a high-speed solar wind stream from a coronal hole has boosted geomagnetic activity.
The aurora australis is caused by charged particles from the solar wind interacting with the Earth's magnetic field and atmosphere. These particles, mainly electrons and protons, precipitate into the upper atmosphere, exciting atoms of oxygen and nitrogen, which emit light as they return to their ground state.
The colours of the aurora depend on the energy of the particles and the altitude at which they collide with the atmosphere.

Even common ""blue"" foods such as blueberries or blue corn are actually shades of purple or indigo. But a rare rainforest tree proves otherwise. The Elaeocarpus angustifolius, known as the blue quandong, blue fig, or blue marble tree, grows in Australia, Papua New Guinea, and parts of Indonesia, and produces the only known fruit with a genuine, vivid blue appearance.
The fruit looks so bright and metallic that many assume its colour is digitally edited. But researchers confirm that the blue marble fruit's intense hue is natural and does not come from pigments. Instead, it results from structural colouration, a light-bending optical effect similar to the colours seen in peacock feathers or butterfly wings.
Studies published inNatureandPNASreveal that the fruit's skin contains ultra-thin layers of cellulose arranged in nanoscale patterns. These layers reflect only blue wavelengths of light while cancelling out all others. Interestingly, when scientists attempted to extract blue pigment from the fruit, the material turned grey, proving the colour isn't chemical.
This structural blue makes the fruit one of only six known in the world to use this phenomenon. Researchers believe the tree evolved this feature to attract birds, which see blue and UV light very clearly. The glossy blue fruit stands out even under dense rainforest shade, helping birds locate it from long distances and spread its seeds widely. The blue quandong remains an evolutionary mystery and a rare example of how nature uses physics, not pigments, to create extraordinary colours.

Experts say this eclipse will bring the longest period of total darkness seen this century, lasting up to 6 minutes and 23 seconds on the centreline.
The eclipse will begin over the Atlantic Ocean before reaching land near the Strait of Gibraltar. From there, the path of totality will cross southern Spain, Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Libya and Egypt before moving into regions of the Middle East. Because it passes through many populated areas with good travel routes, a large number of visitors are expected to gather along the track. Countries in the Americas, including Brazil, will not see any part of the event.
People inside the narrowband of totality will experience daylight fading into deep twilight as the Moon completely covers the Sun. Those outside this zone will see only a partial eclipse, which reduces sunlight but does not reveal the Sun's corona.
The event will follow a predictable sequence. Around 60 to 80 minutes before totality, the Moon will begin to cover the Sun. Total darkness will last from a few seconds to more than six minutes, depending on location. The Sun will then slowly reappear during another hour-long partial phase. Local astronomy agencies will release exact timing details closer to the date.
During totality, observers may notice temperature drops, shifting winds and changes in animal behaviour. The sky may darken enough for Venus, Mercury and other bright objects to appear. Features such as the ""diamond ring"" effect and the Sun's pale corona are also expected to be visible.
Total solar eclipses occur somewhere on Earth roughly every 18 months, but very few last as long or pass through as many accessible regions as this one, making it a significant global event for scientists and skywatchers.

The research, conducted by Professor David H Cropley from the University of South Australia, argues that generative AI models such as ChatGPT are mathematically limited to amateur-level creativity.
Professor Cropley began the study to bring clarity to the ongoing debate about whether AI can truly be creative. He applied the standard definition of creativity, which requires both originality and effectiveness, to the way large language models operate. According to him, this approach helps determine whether the design of AI systems places a natural cap on their creative abilities.
According tothe study,large language models work by predicting the next word or ""token"" based on patterns learned from their training data. Cropley explains that this predictable and statistical method allows for a mathematical evaluation of AI creativity. His analysis shows that while AI can produce outputs that seem creative, its originality is limited by the patterns it has learned, and therefore its creativity cannot rise beyond average human levels.
The study cites previous tests showing that AI-generated stories and ideas usually rank around the 40th to 50th percentile when compared with human work. This supports the conclusion that AI cannot reach expert or professional standards under current design methods.
Cropley notes that most people produce average levels of creativity, which is why AI output can appear impressive to the general public. However, professionals in writing, design, or art quickly notice that AI-generated content is repetitive and formulaic.
According to thestudy,truly high-level creativity involves producing ideas that are both unique and highly effective - something AI cannot achieve because it relies on existing data. Cropley says AI may assist with routine tasks, but it cannot replace skilled creators or produce groundbreaking work on its own.
The paper also acknowledges limitations. It uses simplified mathematical assumptions and focuses on standard AI settings. It does not measure how human editing or advanced prompting may improve final results. Future studies may explore whether adjusting AI parameters or using different architectures could expand its creative potential.
Cropley concludes that achieving expert-level creativity in AI would require a completely new kind of system - one that can generate ideas beyond learned statistical patterns. Until then, human creativity remains unmatched.

According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), over 90% of the 112 lemur species face extinction. While habitat loss, illegal logging, and hunting remain major threats, a new danger has emerged - lemurs are increasingly being hunted and consumed as meat by wealthy city residents.
This alarming trend was uncovered in a four-year study (2022-2025) into Madagascar's hidden lemur meat trade. The research, published inConservation Letters, involved interviews with 2,600 people across 17 cities, including hunters, suppliers, buyers, and restaurant staff.
Findings revealed that nearly 13,000 lemurs are killed and eaten annually. In over one-third of the cities surveyed, lemur meat is regularly consumed. About 94.5% of this trade occurs in secret between suppliers and trusted customers, while 5.5% of the sales take place in restaurants. The meat is often seen as a delicacy, with consumers believing it has a unique taste and even health benefits such as promoting youthfulness.
Brown lemurs and ruffed lemurs are the most hunted species. Restaurants offering wild meat are significantly more expensive, catering to affluent customers.
Researchers stress that traditional conservation methods won't be enough to stop this crisis. They stress that dealing with this crisis requires more than standard conservation efforts. ""Without a comprehensive data-driven approach, the world's most endangered mammals may soon be eaten into extinction.""
They recommend stricter enforcement of firearm laws, awareness campaigns on health risks, and providing hunters with alternative sources of income to reduce dependency on wildlife hunting.

A team from the Science University of Malaysia (USM) in northern Penang has found that tropical bed bugs can retain DNA from human prey for up to 45 days after snacking on an unwary victim.
This makes the tiny critters, who love to lurk in headboard cracks, mattress seams and pillow covers, ideal evidence resources when it comes to pinpointing suspects at crime scenes.
From a speck of blood, police investigators may one day be able to piece together the full profile of an offender, if the critters are present at a crime scene.
Analysing the insects could reveal gender, eye colour, hair and skin colour, entomologist Abdul Hafiz Ab Majid told AFP.
""We call bed bugs the 'musuh dalam selimut' (Malay for ""the enemy in the blanket""),"" Hafiz said, adding that ""they can also be spies"" to help solve crimes.
In a laboratory tucked deep inside USM's School of Biological Sciences, Hafiz and postdoctoral researcher Lim Li have spent nearly half a decade studying tropical bed bugs.
The bloodsuckers, scientific name Cimex hemipterus, are the most common species found in Malaysia and the tropics.
The bugs are reared in containers under a laboratory bench, each wrapped in black plastic to mimic conditions the insects thrive in.
""We place folded pieces of paper inside the small containers so the bed bugs have something to climb on,"" Hafiz said.
With the lab's temperature kept at a constant 23C to 24C, the insects suck up 1.5 to 5.3 microlitres of blood at each feeding, an ""amount less than a droplet"", Hafiz explained.
Researchers found DNA extracted from bed bugs that had fed on human blood could recover basic ""phenotypic profiling"", a person's observable traits, as well as gender for up to 45 days.
Using so-called STR (Short Tandem Repeat) and SNP (Single Nucleotide Polymorphism) markers, specific DNA sequences extracted from the blood, researchers can determine the gender, eye, hair and skin colour of potential suspects, long after they have fled the scene.
The USM study called ""Human profiling from STR and SNP analysis of tropical bed bug, Cimex hemipterus"", was published in Nature's Scientific Reports two years ago.
It was the first documented forensic use involving tropical bed bugs.
Unlike mosquitoes and flies, bed bugs cannot fly, and once they have fed, ""become engorged and can't move around that much"", Hafiz said, adding that they can only move within 20 feet (six metres) of where they've fed.
""That's what makes them unique. We can say they are perfect to use as a forensic tool compared to mosquitoes that... fly away,"" Hafiz added.
The bugs are particularly useful at crime scenes, where fluids have been wiped away to destroy evidence, as the critters are often well-hidden.
Back in the lab, researcher Lim did not hesitate to demonstrate a feeding session, even joking that she had been a ""willing victim"" for science.
""I let them feed on my blood when I wanted to test how long (it would take) the human DNA to degrade,"" she said.
Lim insisted that the inconspicuous bugs are ""misunderstood creatures"" and do not spread diseases -- even though their bite leaves an itchy rash that can last for weeks.
""Maybe we can try educating people because the bed bugs are not actually vectors. So even if you get bitten, they can't transmit diseases to you,"" she said.
While the researchers imagined a future where tiny bed bugs at crime scenes could lead investigators to murder suspects, Hafiz said the insects weren't a magic fix.
Bed bugs have their limits -- especially when it comes to cracking cold cases, said Hafiz.
""It only gives investigators a time frame of 45 days to use bed bugs as evidence -- and only if they are available at the crime scene,"" he said.

Even though it's huge, scientists say it's smaller than in many previous years, making it the fifth smallest ozone hole since 1992. NASA and NOAA scientists report that the ozone layer is gradually healing because of the Montreal Protocol, an international agreement that banned chemicals that destroy ozone.
Scientists believe that if the trend continues, the ozone layer is expected to recover later this century fully.
The ozone hole over Antarctica is slowly recovering, according to@nasa&@noaa's long-term record.This year's ozone hole was the 5th-smallest on record, reaching an annual maximum extent of 8.83 million square miles on Sept. 9, 2025.https://t.co/becxmD6aKlpic.twitter.com/4glMTeXlng
Paul Newman, a senior scientist with the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, and leader of the ozone research team at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland,said, ""As predicted, we're seeing ozone holes trending smaller in area than they were in the early 2000s.""
""They're forming later in the season and breaking up earlier. But we still have a long way to go before it recovers to 1980s levels,"" he added.
This year, during the depletion season between September 7 and October 13, the average size of the hole was 7.23 million square miles. It is the season when the ozone hole is the largest and it starts shrinking after the depletion season.
In 2025, it is breaking up nearly three weeks earlier than usual compared to the past 10 years.
Stephen Montzka, a senior scientist with NOAA's Global Monitoring Laboratory, said, ""Since peaking around the year 2000, levels of ozone-depleting substances in the Antarctic stratosphere have declined by about a third, relative to pre-ozone-hole levels.""
The ozone layer, located between 7 and 31 miles above the Earth's surface, protects life on the planet by filtering dangerous UV rays.Ozone depletion occurs when human-made compounds containing chlorine and bromine, once widely used in aerosol sprays, foams, air conditioners, and refrigerators, rise into the stratosphere.
""This year's hole would have been more than one million square miles larger if there was still as much chlorine in the stratosphere as there was 25 years ago,"" said Newman.

https://www.ndtv.com/science/thirty-metre-telescope-india-japan-team-up-to-search-for-extraterrestrial-life-with-giant-telescope-9695319,"Do Aliens Exist? India, Japan Team Up To Answer Question With Giant Telescope","Tue, 25 Nov 2025 11:12:33 +0530","In a landmark collaboration, India and Japan are joining forces to build one of the world's most ambitious astronomical instruments - the Thirty Metre Telescope (TMT). This cutting-edge optical-infrared telescope, with a massive 30-metre primary mirror, promises to revolutionise our understanding of the universe and could even answer humanity's most profound question: Are we alone?
The TMT project is an international partnership involving India, Japan, and two leading US universities. Its primary goal is to peer deeper into the cosmos than ever before, studying black holes, distant galaxies, and, most intriguingly, searching for signs of life beyond Earth.
""Astronomers want to have a bigger mirror to collect more light from the distant universe,"" explained Dr. Saku Tsuneta, Vice Chair of the Committee on National Space Policy at Japan's Cabinet Office, Tokyo. ""The bigger the mirror, the more discoveries you can make about very distant objects.""
The TMT's 30-metre mirror will dwarf existing telescopes, enabling unprecedented clarity and depth in observations. Unlike traditional telescopes with a single large mirror, TMT will use 500 precisely aligned smaller mirrors to form its giant primary mirror. This complex engineering feat requires cutting-edge technology-and that's where India plays a pivotal role.
""Instead of one large mirror, we have 500 smaller mirrors consisting of one 30-metre primary mirror,"" said Dr. Tsuneta. ""The location and angle of each mirror has to be carefully adjusted. That has been done by Indian technology.""
India's contribution lies in developing opto-mechanical systems that ensure these mirrors remain perfectly aligned, a critical requirement for the telescope's success. This collaboration underscores India's growing stature in global science and technology partnerships.
India is a founder-member partner in this project, which aims to open new windows to the universe through optical and infrared astronomy. Indian participation in this project was approved by the Union Cabinet in 2014. India's participation in the TMT collaboration involves three institutes: the Indian Institute of Astrophysics (IIA), Bengaluru, the Inter-University Center for Astronomy and Astrophysics (IUCAA), Pune, and the Aryabhatta Research Institute for Observational Sciences (ARIES), Nainital.
The chosen site for TMT is Mauna Kea in Hawaii, at an altitude of 4,000 metres – a location renowned for its clear skies and minimal atmospheric interference. Japan already operates an 8.2-metre telescope there, which has been delivering ground breaking observations for over 25 years.
""Our primary site for construction is Mauna Kea in Hawaii,"" Dr. Tsuneta confirmed. ""This is one of the best sites for astronomical observation.""
However, the project faces challenges. Mauna Kea is considered sacred by Native Hawaiian communities, leading to protests against construction. Negotiations are ongoing to address cultural concerns and seek consent.
""We don't want to build a telescope without their permission,"" Dr. Tsuneta emphasised. ""It's an ongoing process.""
Interestingly, alternative sites have been discussed, including Hanle in Ladakh, India, which already hosts a high-altitude observatory. While no decision has been made, the possibility reflects India's growing role in global astronomy.
The telescope's scientific agenda is vast. It will study black holes, map distant galaxies, and probe the early universe. But its most exciting mission is the search for extraterrestrial life.
""One of the important purposes is to find life on another planet other than Earth,"" said Dr. Tsuneta. ""Astronomers believe there are other life forms elsewhere, distant from Earth. This telescope will find the signature of life forms in planetary systems belonging to other stars – not our Sun.""
This means TMT will analyse exoplanets – planets orbiting stars outside our solar system – for chemical signatures that indicate life, such as water vapour or organic molecules.
The TMT is expected to be operational by the mid-2030s. Technological development is progressing well, thanks to contributions from partner nations, particularly India's precision engineering.
""Technologically, thanks to the Indian contribution, progress is in good shape,"" Dr. Tsuneta noted.
The implications of TMT's discoveries could be monumental. Detecting life beyond Earth would be one of the greatest scientific breakthroughs of all time, potentially earning global recognition.
""If you find it, you will get a Nobel Prize,"" quipped Pallava Bagla during the conversation.
""I'm too old,"" laughed Dr. Tsuneta. ""Younger people should get a Nobel Prize, not me. Obviously, the team should get it.""
India-Japan: Partners in Space and BeyondThis collaboration builds on a strong history of India-Japan cooperation in space science.
The two nations are already working together on LUPEX, a lunar exploration mission to search for water on the Moon. Now, with TMT, they aim to look for life among the stars.
India and Japan are old and good friends; they are together looking for water on the Moon through LUPEX and life on other stars using the Thirty Metre Telescope.
The TMT project represents more than just a scientific instrument – it's a symbol of international collaboration, technological innovation, and humanity's relentless curiosity. As India and Japan join hands to explore the cosmos, the dream of finding life beyond Earth moves closer to reality.

https://www.ndtv.com/science/study-reveals-the-mystery-behind-giant-radio-relics-in-the-universe-9691786,Study Reveals The Mystery Behind Giant Radio Relics In The Universe,"Mon, 24 Nov 2025 22:09:14 +0530","At the largest scales of the universe, huge clusters of galaxies crash into one another in extremely slow but powerful collisions. These events leave behind giant, faint arcs, long ribbons of radio waves stretching across millions of light-years. These ghostly structures, called radio relics, are created when massive shock waves speed up electrons to nearly the speed of light, reportedSpace.com.
Astronomers have found many such relics, but their strange behaviour has been very hard to understand.
Scientists have discovered that the magnetic fields within radio relics are much stronger than expected. Measurements using radio and X-ray light reveal different strengths of the shock waves. Further complicating the puzzlement is that X-ray data suggests that these shocks are not strong enough to accelerate electrons, raising the question of how radio relics form.
A recent study by scientists at the Leibnitz Institute for Astrophysics Potsdam (AIP) in Germany offers a solution to these long-standing questions. The team used high-resolution simulations to understand how radio relics are form and how they change over time. Their model recreated the mysterious features seen in actual observations, further shedding light on the nature of these massive arc-like structures.
Joseph Whittingham, the lead author of the study and a postdoctoral researcher at AIP, explains that studying the problem at different scales was key to their success. In their paper, he and his team write that they used a large set of cosmological simulations that show how galaxy clusters evolve and collide over billions of years.
In this data, they focused on an extremely powerful collision between two clusters, one about 2.5 times more massive than the other. This collision generated massive, arched shock waves extending nearly 7 million light-years.
Based on these initial findings, the team further developed extremely high-resolution simulations called ""shock-tubes."" Through these, they were able to understand the precise physics of a single shock wave traveling through the uneven and turbulent outer regions of a galaxy cluster. From this, they developed models that show how electrons are accelerated at the shock front and how the radio waves emitted would appear in a telescope.
This multi-scale approach enables them to understand the microscopic physics that current large cosmological simulations don't fully capture.
The simulations revealed that as the shock wave moves outward from the cluster, it collides with shocks created by cold gas coming from the cosmic web. This collision transforms the plasma into a dense layer, which in turn collides with smaller clumps of gas. This creates a turbulent environment, strengthening the magnetic fields to the point where they reach values comparable to those recorded in actual observations.
Study co-author and AIP scientist Christoph Frommer explains that this entire process creates turbulence, which twists and compresses the magnetic fields, leading to the strengths astronomers have observed. This solves a previously major mystery.
The study also explains why radio and X-ray measurements differ. When the shock wave collides with dense gas clumps, some parts of the shock become more powerful and accelerate electrons more efficiently. These bright and dense parts are the primary contributors to radio signals.
However, X-ray instruments measure an average of the entire width of the shock, including the weaker parts. This explains the discrepancy between the two.
Simulations also show that the strongest and most confined parts of the shock wave produce almost all of the radio emission. Therefore, the low average shock strength measured by X-rays does not conflict with the mechanism of radio emission.
These multi-scale simulations together reproduced the same combination of magnetic, radio, and X-ray properties seen in real radio emission. This has resolved many long-standing questions about these mysterious structures.
Whittingham says this achievement inspires him to continue his research and understand the remaining mysteries of radio waves.

https://www.ndtv.com/science/study-reveals-hidden-deep-earth-structures-that-rewrite-planets-history-9691500,Study Reveals Hidden Deep-Earth Structures That Can Rewrite Planet's History,"Mon, 24 Nov 2025 23:16:08 +0530","A new study offers a fresh explanation for two mysterious structures hidden nearly 1,800 miles beneath our feet. For decades, scientists have struggled to understand these enormous formations because their size, shape and strange behaviour do not match traditional ideas about how Earth formed. Now, new research published in Nature Geoscience may finally help solve this puzzle and reveal how these deep-Earth processes shaped the planet we live on today, reportedScience Daily.
This new understanding comes from a study by a team led by Rutgers University geodynamicist Yoshinori Miyazaki. The research focused on two unique structures at the boundary between Earth's mantle and core, Large Low-Shear-Velocity Provinces (LLSVPs) and Ultra-Low-Velocity Zones (ULVZs).
LLSVPs are vast regions of extremely hot and dense rock, one located beneath Africa and the other beneath the Pacific Ocean. ULVZs, on the other hand, are thin, partially molten layers that appear as small pockets of sediment above the core. Both structures significantly attenuate seismic waves, indicating that they contain materials or conditions different from the surrounding mantle.
According to Miyazaki, these structures are neither coincidental nor anomalous. He said these are like traces of Earth's early history, and understanding them could help explain how Earth formed and became habitable.
Miyazaki explained that Earth was once covered by a vast ocean of molten rock. As this magma ocean cooled, scientists expected clear chemical layers to develop in the mantle, much like the separation of juice's sweet and watery parts when it freezes.
But seismic studies don't reveal such layers. Instead, LLSVPs and ULVZs appear as irregular patches at the bottom of the mantle.
The team believes that the missing element is Earth's core. Their models suggest that over billions of years, elements like silicon and magnesium gradually migrated from the core to the mantle. This mixing prevented the mantle from forming the expected chemical layers.
This same process also shaped the unique structure of LLSVPs and ULVZs. According to the researchers, these structures are the cooled remnants of ""basal magma oceans"" that were altered by material ejected from the core. Miyazaki says that taking this material into account makes sense for why these structures look the way they do today.
Miyazaki said that these processes between the mantle and core can influence not only the chemical composition but also the Earth's heat flow, volcanic activity, and the evolution of its atmosphere. This could help explain why water and life survived on Earth, while Venus became extremely hot and Mars became cold and lifeless.
They explained that Earth's atmosphere is stable, Venus's atmosphere is very dense and filled primarily with carbon dioxide, while Mars' atmosphere is very thin. The cooling of each planet and the evolution of its internal structures may be a major factor in these differences.
By combining seismic data, mineral physics, and geodynamic modelling, the team demonstrated that deep structures like LLSVPs and ULVZs are important evidence of Earth's formation. The research also indicates that these regions may have played a key role in powering volcanic hotspots like Hawaii and Iceland, providing a direct link between Earth's internal and external processes.
Co-author Ji Deng said this study is an example of how collaboration between different scientific fields can help solve Earth's long-standing mysteries. He added that chemical traces of early core-mantle interactions may still be present in the mantle, opening new avenues for understanding Earth's unique evolution.
Researchers say each new discovery brings them closer to piecing together Earth's early history. Previously disparate clues now appear to form a clearer and more connected story.

A giant object the size of Mars, named Theia, crashed into Earth 4.5 billion years ago. This huge impact not only formed the Moon but also changed Earth's shape, mass, and composition. But now, new research suggests we may have misunderstood this event for a long time, reportedNY Post.
Scientists from the journal Science and the Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research (MPS) say the famous collision might not have happened by chance after all. Their findings could change the way we understand how the Moon, and even Earth itself, came to be.
Early in the solar system, it is believed that Earth collided with a large, Mars-like object-Theia. This powerful impact ejected a large amount of material into space, and the debris later formed the Moon.
This event wasn't limited to the formation of the Moon. It also altered Earth's initial structure, giving it the mass and chemical composition it possesses today.
New studies question the idea that Theia's collision was purely coincidental. Scientists believe there may be deeper reasons behind this collision, explaining how and why it occurred.
According to researchers, the composition of a planet or celestial body holds the entire story of its formation and origin. Thorsten Klein of the Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research says that the elements present within a planet reflect its birth history. This suggests that the collision was likely part of a predetermined sequence or process, rather than just a random event.
Despite these new findings, some scientists remain cautious. Dr. Paul Byrne, a planetary scientist at Washington University in St. Louis, said that while researchers have collected information by examining a wide variety of samples, he is still hesitant to immediately accept these new findings.
He said that no matter how much effort scientists make, much of the past remains a mystery, because the past is truly ""lost to us.""

https://www.ndtv.com/science/astronomers-spot-possible-primordial-cluster-beyond-neptune-9686401,Astronomers Spot Possible Primordial Cluster Beyond Neptune,"Sun, 23 Nov 2025 18:51:27 +0530","Astronomers believe they may have discovered evidence of a mysterious structure far beyond Neptune, hidden deep inside the Kuiper Belt. This new finding could help scientists understand what the early solar system looked like billions of years ago. The study points to a dense group of icy objects that may have remained untouched since the beginning of the solar system. Although the research is still being reviewed, the possible implications are significant, reportedDaily Galaxy.
The Kuiper Belt is often referred to as the solar system's ""third region."" It extends approximately 30 to 50 astronomical units (AU) from the Sun and contains icy remnants left behind during the solar system's formation.
According to NASA, this region lies beyond the orbit of Neptune, in the outer reaches of the solar system. Scientists estimate that millions of icy objects may exist here, many of which are over 60 miles (100 kilometres) across, while some, like Pluto, are larger than 600 miles (1,000 kilometres).
Like the asteroid belt, the Kuiper Belt is composed of fragments left over from incomplete planet formation. The difference is that while the asteroid belt is thin, the Kuiper Belt forms a thick, doughnut-like structure, shaped specifically by the gravity of the giant planets, including Neptune. This gravitational influence has caused the positions and distribution of objects in this region to change over time.
Despite long-term study, scientists still don't fully understand the structure of the Kuiper Belt. In 2011, researchers discovered that it isn't a uniform and linear region. A study published in The Astronomical Journal described it as a complex region with multiple substructures. The research also revealed that the classical belt contains multiple components that extend far beyond the traditionally described inner, core, and outer regions.
A team of scientists from Princeton University, led by astrophysicist Aamir Siraj, has identified a new structure at a distance of approximately 43 AU. They believe it could be a ""primordial cluster""-a group of icy objects that has existed virtually unchanged since the early solar system. Siraj told New Scientist that the extremely calm and stable orbits of these objects indicate the region's antiquity and minimal disruption. According to them, this stability could provide important insights into the early history and evolution of the Solar System.
This discovery could also help explain how giant planets formed and gradually reached their current orbits. Scientists also suggest that this structure could hold insights into the early interstellar conditions the Solar System faced during its formation.
This study builds on a 2011 discovery that identified a ""kernel"" region of the Kuiper Belt, a region where objects' orbits remain stable and have low eccentricity over long periods of time. The new structure, located slightly inside this older kernel, shows even lower eccentricity, suggesting it may be even older and more stable.
According to Princeton researchers, the classical belt's structure should be understood as consisting of three major components, a ""hot"" component with a wide variation in orbits, and two ""cold"" components, called the core and the kernel. Now, the new structure discovered at 43 AU, with an even lower eccentricity, raises the possibility that an ""inner kernel"" may exist, possibly formed earlier and experiencing less disruption than other parts of the Kuiper Belt.

https://www.ndtv.com/science/stealth-solar-storm-hit-earth-leaving-scientists-surprised-9686088,"Stealth Solar Storm Hits Earth, Leaves Scientists Surprised","Sun, 23 Nov 2025 16:19:26 +0530","A solar storm quietly reached Earth on November 20, surprising scientists because it arrived without any warning signs. This type of eruption, called a stealth solar storm, is unusual because it cannot be easily seen in regular solar images. Even though this event did not trigger a geomagnetic storm, it may have helped create auroras visible in some mid-latitude regions, reportedSpace.com.
Stealth solar storms are coronal mass ejections (CMEs) that emerge from the Sun but leave almost no visible traces along their path. Normal CMEs are easily detected in solar observations, but stealth CMEs erupt extremely quietly and slowly, making them extremely challenging to track.
While normal CMEs appear as bright flares, sudden changes in ultraviolet light, or large loop-like formations rising from the Sun's surface, and coronagraphs capture them as large, diffuse clouds, stealth CMEs behave in the opposite way. They appear very faint, move slowly, and leave no bright signature behind. Because of this, scientists often detect them only when they approach Earth and disrupt the solar wind.
This is exactly what happened on November 20th. NOAA experts observed unusual changes in solar wind patterns and speculated that a stealth CME may have struck Earth. On that day, the solar wind was primarily influenced by a coronal hole's high-speed stream with negative polarity. They also recorded a signal called an ""embedded transient,"" which is believed to be a hidden clue to a stealth CME.
The most significant signal was a sudden increase in the magnetic field. The solar wind speed was between 400-500 km/s, which is higher than the normal speed around Earth.
Space weather expert Tamitha Skov reported on social media that stealth solar storms have become active again. She said they are called ""stealthy"" because they leave no visible trace in observations of the Sun's disk or coronagraph. According to her, such storms are only detected when they collide with Earth.
They added that this event is likely to cause a mild geomagnetic storm at high latitudes. However, they also warned that when stealth CMEs pass near high-speed solar wind currents, they can in some cases produce more powerful storms than expected.
Stealth CMEs are typically more common when the Sun is in the waning phase of its 11-year solar activity cycle. During this time, the Sun's magnetic activity changes, increasing the likelihood of unusual events.
Although the November 20th storm did not pose a major threat, its nature is significant. It highlights how unpredictable the Sun can be and reminds us that even seemingly quiet eruptions can impact Earth's space environment.

The event, known as a coronal mass ejection (CME), was detected using the European Space Agency's XMM-Newton space observatory and the LOFAR radio telescope. The findings, published in the journal Nature, offer scientists a new way to understand how stars influence the planets that orbit them, reportedEuro News.
A CME is formed when a large amount of plasma is violently ejected from a star's upper atmosphere and spreads into space. Such intense eruptions affect the surrounding space, and scientists classify them as ""space weather."" This includes solar storms, which can produce auroras on Earth and weaken the atmospheres of nearby planets.
For many years, astronomers have been trying to observe CMEs on other stars, as such eruptions play a crucial role in determining whether a planet can remain habitable. Henrik Eklund, a scientist at the European Space Research and Technology Centre in the Netherlands, says this discovery provides new opportunities to understand space weather and eruptions on other stars. He says researchers will no longer be limited to the Sun as an example to understand CMEs.
The researchers also noted that smaller stars can produce much more powerful and intense space weather than the Sun. Such intense activity can determine whether planets orbiting such stars can retain their atmospheres and remain habitable.
This CME, observed outside our solar system, had so much energy that it could completely strip any planet in its path. This CME was moving at an incredible speed of about 2,400 kilometres per second, a speed only recorded in about one in twenty CMEs occurring on the Sun. According to the study, this explosion was not only fast but also so intense that any planet near the star would not be able to retain its atmosphere.
This event originated from a red dwarf star, which is much dimmer, cooler, and smaller than the Sun, with a mass approximately half that of the Sun. Research revealed that this star rotates about 20 times faster than the Sun and has a magnetic field about 300 times stronger. Since most of the planets in our galaxy have been found to orbit similar stars, this observation is considered extremely important in understanding the actual conditions of those planets.

They warn that ""rapid industrialisation"" has changed human habits so quickly that our biology may struggle to keep up. Crowded, polluted cities and a lack of connection with nature could be affecting key biological functions that are essential for survival and reproduction, reportedNewsweek.
According to researchers, living in cities can have a negative impact on reproductive health, causing problems like infertility and decreased sperm count. It can also affect the immune system, increasing the risk of allergies and autoimmune diseases. Additionally, cognitive abilities may decline, leading to slower mental development and faster mental aging, while physical strength and stamina may also decrease.
Fertility rates are falling worldwide, and chronic diseases are on the rise. It is estimated that by 2050, approximately 68 percent of people will live in cities, making the consequences of these impacts potentially severe. Danny Longman, senior lecturer in human evolutionary physiology at Loughborough University, said that for most of human history our biological structure was adapted to the natural environment, but industrialisation has changed the environment around us so rapidly that our bodies have not been able to fully adapt to it. He called this the ""Environmental Mismatch Hypothesis,"" that is, humans are not fully adapted to modern urban life.
Longman said the study combined findings from laboratory experiments, field studies and population research. Instead of gathering new information, researchers reviewed data from anthropology, ecology, physiology, and public health to understand how the modern environment impacts the human body. Their findings revealed both short- and long-term effects of living in cities.
The body's stress response mechanisms are constantly activated by the daily noise, crowds, traffic, constant digital stimulation and limited access to nature in the city. This may result in increased anxiety, disrupted sleep, and decreased ability to concentrate. Over time, these persistent stresses can lead to mental health problems, stress on the heart, cognitive impairment, immune system imbalances, and decreased reproductive health.
Polluted, noisy and crowded urban environments can impair physical performance, especially in endurance tasks. Longman points out that commuting on busy city streets isn't just inconvenient, it can have real biological consequences.
Researchers believe that due to increasing population and expansion of cities, humans will not be able to return to natural habitats soon. The study shows that understanding the mismatch between modern urban life and our biological makeup is vital to addressing the health challenges facing today's cities.

The animal, known as ""Yuka,"" was found near Siberia's Arctic coast in 2010 and had been preserved in ice for almost 40,000 years. Researchers now say that Yuka's body holds traces of ancient RNA, delicate genetic molecules that normally break down soon after death. This discovery offers a new way to understand prehistoric life, reportedNational Geographic.
Scientists recently reported that Yuka's tissues contained another rare treasure such as remains of ribonucleic acid (RNA), and the genetic molecules essential to life.
Normally RNA is destroyed soon after death, so this is considered to be the oldest RNA discovered so far and it has been obtained for the first time from the woolly mammoth. This study has been published in Cell journal.
Scientists have been studying DNA fragments from mammoth specimens for decades, and with the help of this genetic information, they have created the genome of this species and discovered how close mammoths are to modern elephants. But RNA has been difficult to find because it is less stable than DNA.
Like DNA, RNA is single-stranded and plays an important role in activating genes and making proteins.
RNA is also important in the study of viruses, such as influenza and coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). Love Co-author Love Dalen, a developmental genomics researcher at Stockholm University said that with the help of ancient RNA, signs of Ice Age viruses present with ancient animals trapped in ice can be discovered. RNA viruses were not found in yuca, but traces of ancient pathogens may be found in other prehistoric samples.
Scientists previously believed that RNA decays so quickly that it cannot survive for more than a few centuries, much less thousands of years. Recent studies have challenged this belief. In 2023, Dalen's team obtained RNA from the skin and muscle of a Tasmanian tiger specimen that had been kept in a museum for more than 130 years. In 2017 researchers extracted RNA from the stomach tissue of a 5,300-year-old ice mummy.
To search for even older RNA, Pour and his team focused on the permafrost regions of Siberia, where thawing soil has yielded many amazing discoveries. In addition to mammoth specimens like Yuka, researchers have also found skin and muscle tissue from mummified saber-tooth cat cubs and other frozen animals.
These discoveries suggest that permanent ice may hold even more secrets of prehistoric life, including ancient gene activation and possibly even long-lost viruses.

https://www.ndtv.com/science/chandrayaan-5-search-for-water-ice-on-moons-south-pole-to-see-india-japan-collaboration-9671949,Search For Water Ice On Moon's South Pole To See India-Japan Collaboration,"Thu, 20 Nov 2025 20:42:30 +0530","India and Japan are preparing among the most ambitious space missions of this decade - a joint lunar exploration that could change the way humanity looks at the Moon. The mission, called Lunar Polar Exploration Mission (LUPEX), also known as Chandrayaan-5, will attempt to land near the Moon's South Pole to search for water ice, a resource that could unlock permanent human presence beyond Earth.
The collaboration between Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) is historic. For the first time, the two countries are combining their strengths - India will provide the lander, leveraging its proven technology from Chandrayaan-3, while Japan will contribute its powerful H3 launch vehicle and a sophisticated rover. The mission is slated for launch in 2028.
""Water is really essential for survival of humankind,"" says Dr Saku Tsuneta, Vice Chair of the Committee on National Space Policy, Cabinet Office, Government of Japan. ""If you want to go to the Moon and if you want to live on the Moon, you need water for survival. Bringing water from Earth is extremely expensive.""
Beyond drinking and life support, water on the Moon can be split into hydrogen and oxygen, creating rocket fuel for future missions to Mars and beyond. ""If you have water, you can create fuel so that you can fly elsewhere from the Moon, to say Mars,"" Dr Tsuneta explains. This makes water the single most valuable resource for space exploration.
The rover, expected to weigh around 350 kilograms, will be the heaviest ever sent to the Moon.
The mission will target the Moon's polar regions, where conditions favour the presence of ice. ""In the equatorial region, it is illuminated by heavy sunshine and it's extremely hot, so any form of water is vaporised,"" says Dr Tsuneta. ""In the polar region, the sun illuminates horizontally, so there are multiple shadows by the mountains where you can find ice.""
Landing in this rugged terrain is no easy task. But India's success with Chandrayaan-3 gives Japan confidence. ""India has already landed successfully in the polar region. So, we fully rely on India's ability to land on the desired area, where we surely find water, ice,"" he adds.
The rover, expected to weigh around 350 kilograms, will be the heaviest ever sent to the Moon. It is designed to operate for 100 days, enduring extreme lunar conditions. The biggest challenge is surviving the lunar night, when temperatures plunge below -100 degrees Celsius and sunlight disappears for two weeks. Without a radioactive heat source, engineers have devised an innovative solution. ""This rover has a mechanism to protect itself to reduce heat dissipation,"" says Dr Tsuneta. ""It insulates itself, and when the night comes, the insulator protects the rover. It's like giving the rover a sweater."" He says currently the 'rover is over-weight and ISRO wants a slimmer rover'.
The race to find water is not just scientific - it's strategic. ""The United States, European countries, Japan and India all try to find water as early as possible. Otherwise, someone else finds the water. They may say, this is ours,"" warns Dr Tsuneta.
Permanent lunar habitation will require building infrastructure using local resources. ""Rather than bringing things from Earth, you have to create buildings and systems there by Moon material,"" he says. ""One country cannot do everything. This is where Japan and India should work together.""
LUPEX, if successful, will pave the way for human bases on the Moon, enabling sustainable exploration and serving as a launch pad for interplanetary travel. ""ISRO is an excellent partner for us,"" Dr Tsuneta emphasises. ""They have a landing technology which is quite reliable. India had a successful landing already. So we have full confidence in ISRO's reliability.""
