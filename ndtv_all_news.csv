Trump ""will honor American Veterans, active-duty servicemembers, and military history with a military parade!"" White House spokeswoman Anna Kelly wrote on X. In addition to the parade, the celebration of the service's birthday will feature fireworks and a festival on the National Mall, US Army spokeswoman Heather Hagan said. ""Given the significant milestone of 250 years, the Army is exploring options to make the celebration even bigger, with more capability demonstrations, additional displays of equipment, and more engagement with the community,"" Hagan said. ""Parade planning is actively underway, and we anticipate approximately 150 vehicles, 50 aircraft, and 6,600 soldiers,"" she added. Trump had floated the idea of holding a military parade in Washington during his first term after attending a Bastille Day parade in France.  It never materialized, however, after the Pentagon said it could cost $92 million and concerns were raised that tanks and other heavy military vehicles would damage the city's streets. Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser raised similar concerns last month when asked by reporters about plans for a parade. ""Military tanks on our streets would not be good,"" Bowser said. ""If military tanks were used they should be accompanied with many millions of dollars to repair the roads."" - 'We never celebrate anything' - The last major US military parade in Washington was held in 1991 to celebrate the end of the Gulf War. The new parade announcement came a day after Trump said he was declaring May 8 to be Victory Day for World War II and changing Veterans Day -- observed on November 11 -- to Victory Day for World War I. In a post on his Truth Social platform, the US president downplayed the role of European countries -- many of which suffered far more casualties and devastation than the United States -- in the two global conflicts. ""We won both Wars, nobody was close to us in terms of strength, bravery, or military brilliance, but we never celebrate anything -- That's because we don't have leaders anymore, that know how to do so! We are going to start celebrating our victories again!"" Trump wrote. Trump has had a contradictory relationship with US military forces, lauding their power but also claiming they were depleted and in need of rebuilding. He at times clashed with military brass during his 2016-2020 term in office and reportedly referred to fallen troops as ""losers"" and ""suckers"" -- something he denied. During his second term, Trump has overseen a purge of top officers, including chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff general Charles ""CQ"" Brown, whom he fired without explanation in February. Other senior officers dismissed this year include the heads of the Navy and Coast Guard, the general who headed the National Security Agency, the vice chief of staff of the Air Force, a Navy admiral assigned to NATO, and three top military lawyers. US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has insisted the president is simply choosing the leaders he wants, but Democratic lawmakers have raised concerns about the potential politicization of the traditionally neutral US military.

The Trump administration has informed lawmakers about the planned cuts at the CIA, which will take place over several years and be accomplished in part through reduced hiring as opposed to layoffs, the newspaper said. Asked about the report, a CIA spokesperson did not confirm the specifics, but said that Director John Ratcliffe ""is moving swiftly to ensure the CIA workforce is responsive to the administration's national security priorities."" ""These moves are part of a holistic strategy to infuse the agency with renewed energy, provide opportunities for rising leaders to emerge, and better position CIA to deliver on its mission,"" the spokesperson said. The CIA earlier this year became the first US intelligence agency to join a voluntary redundancy program initiated by President Donald Trump, who has vowed to radically downsize the federal workforce in the name of efficiency and frugality.  Ratcliffe previously told lawmakers that under his leadership, the agency would ""produce insightful, objective, all-source analysis, never allowing political or personal biases to cloud our judgment or infect our products."" ""We will collect intelligence, especially human intelligence, in every corner of the globe, no matter how dark or difficult,"" as well as ""conduct covert action at the direction of the president, going places no one else can go and doing things no one else can do."" Addressing CIA officers, he said: ""If all of this sounds like what you signed up for, then buckle up and get ready to make a difference. If it doesn't, then it's time to find a new line of work.""

Detectives probing the crash said a pickup truck collided with a van carrying 14 people on Thursday evening by Henry's Lake in eastern Idaho. ""Tragically, six individuals in the van and the driver of the pickup died as a result of the crash,"" a statement from Idaho State Police said Friday. Pictures in local media showed a badly crumpled red truck and a van that had been engulfed in flames. Police said an air ambulance had been called in to transport victims to hospitals ""due to the severity of the injuries."" There was no information on the identities or nationalities of those caught up in the crash. Locals quoted by media said the road is usually busy because it leads to one of the entrances to Yellowstone. Millions of tourists -- domestic and international -- travel every year to Yellowstone, the first national park to be established in the United States, which covers portions of Wyoming, Idaho and Montana. It is home to thousands of geothermal features -- hot springs, mudpots, steam vents and about half the world's active geysers, including Old Faithful.

Yunus' interim government on Friday distanced itself from the remarks made by Major General (Retd) ALM Fazlur Rahman on his social media account. In a Facebook post on Tuesday, Rahman wrote in Bengali, ""If India attacks Pakistan, Bangladesh should occupy the seven states of Northeastern India."" ""I think it is necessary to start discussions with China on a joint military arrangement in this regard,"" he added. Rahman was appointed by the Yunus-led interim government in December 2024 as the chairman of the National Independent Commission assigned to investigate the killings in the Bangladesh Rifles revolt of 2009.  Distancing itself from the former army officer's remarks, Bangladesh's Ministry of Foreign Affairs in a media release on Friday said, ""The comments do not reflect the position or policies of the government of Bangladesh, and as such, the government neither endorses nor supports such rhetoric in any form or manner."" The government urged all concerned to refrain from associating the state with the personal views expressed by Rahman, the Dhaka Tribune newspaper reported. Bangladesh remains firmly committed to the principles of sovereignty, territorial integrity, mutual respect, and the peaceful coexistence of all nations, the ministry said. Earlier in March, Chief Adviser Yunus, during his visit to China, had remarked that India's seven northeastern states, which share a nearly 1,600-km border with Bangladesh, are landlocked and have no way to reach the ocean except through his country. In his address at a business event in China, Yunus said Dhaka was the ""only guardian"" of the Indian Ocean in the region, as he invited Beijing to send goods through Bangladesh across the world. The comments did not go down well in New Delhi. It also drew sharp reactions from political leaders in India across party lines. Days after Yunus' controversial remarks, India in April withdrew the transhipment facility it had granted to Bangladesh for exporting goods to the Middle East, Europe and various other countries except Nepal and Bhutan. Bangladesh has been using several Indian ports and airports for its exports to West Asia, Europe, and many other countries. India has exempted Bangladeshi exports to Nepal and Bhutan, as such trade facilitation is mandatory for landlocked countries under the framework of provisions of the World Trade Organisation (WTO). India-Bangladesh relation has nosedived after Yunus failed to contain attacks on minorities, especially Hindus, in that country after the fall of Sheikh Hasina's Awami League government in August last year.

Mr Channi later said he had not sought proof and that the Congress stands with the government ""like a rock"" as it takes measures against Pakistan following last week's attack.  Addressing a press conference on Friday after a meeting of the Congress Working Committee (CWC) - the party's highest decision-making body - in which a strong resolution urging the Centre to penalise Pakistan for the Pahalgam attack was passed, Mr Channi said the surgical strike ""could not be seen"". Appearing to confuse the 2019 Balakot air strike and the 2016 surgical strike, Mr Channi, who is a former Punjab chief minister, said in Hindi, ""If a bomb is dropped on our country, would we not know? They say we had conducted a surgical strike in Pakistan... nothing happened, the surgical strikes could not be seen, nobody found out."" Asked if he was seeking proof of the strike, Mr Channi continued, ""I have been demanding it since the beginning. But the need of the hour is to heal the wounds of the people of our country. We demand that (the Centre) do something, identify (those behind the Pahalgam attack) and punish them."" The BJP pounced on Mr Channi's remarks and accused him and the Congress of questioning the armed forces. Party leader and Delhi Minister Manjinder Singh Sirsa said in Hindi, ""The Congress has questioned the Army and the Air Force again. Charanjit Singh Channi has said again that he does not believe that the surgical strike was carried out and that he wants proof. What kind of mindset does the Congress and the Gandhi family have that they repeatedly accuse the Army and Air Force of lying and say that Pakistan is telling the truth? This is despite Pakistan itself saying the surgical strike was carried out."" Mr Sirsa also accused the Congress MP of indulging in politics at a time when people have lost their lives in a terror attack. ""If you want proof so badly, visit Pakistan with (Congress MP and Leader of the Opposition) Rahul Gandhi and check where the surgical strike was done,"" he added. BJP Spokesperson Pradeep Bhandari also accused the Congress of ""defending Pakistani terror"".

Rahul Gandhi's Congress continues to defend Pakistani terror! Now Charanjeet Singh Channi questions our forces. Why is Congress demoralising our forces at this critical time. Congress is taking orders directly from Pakistan!"" Later in the evening, Mr Channi said he had not sought proof of the surgical strike. ""I have said earlier as well that the Congress party, in this hour of grief, is standing by the government. If the government disrupts their (Pakistan's) water supply, air or whatever action it takes, we are standing like a rock with it,"" he was quoted as saying by news agency PTI. ""You talked about surgical strikes. We do not ask for proof and no evidence has been sought for it.... The issue today is that we want justice for the families of the victims and the country. We are standing with the government,"" he said. Uri Attack, Response In September 2016, the Army's brigade headquarters was attacked near the town of Uri in Jammu and Kashmir by four terrorists from the Pakistan-based terror organisation Jaish-e-Mohammed. The terrorists lobbed grenades and opened fire, after which a gunbattle began. The attack claimed the lives of 19 soldiers and over 20 others were injured. Days later, on September 29, Indian Army teams crossed the Line of Control and attacked terror launch pads in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. Several terrorists were killed in the surgical strike and the Army said it had taken the action because it had received intelligence that terrorist attacks were being planned against India. Congress Resolution In its resolution, the Congress Working Committee said this was the time to teach Pakistan a lesson and curb terrorism effectively. ""The masterminds and perpetrators of this cowardly attack must face full consequences for their actions. The Congress urges the Government of India to act with firmness, strategic clarity and international coordination to isolate and penalise Pakistan for its continued export of terror into our territory,"" the resolution stated. ""The entire country awaits accountability, answers and justice. In the face of such an unforgivable provocation, the Congress believes this is not a time for politics but a moment that calls for unity, strength, and national resolve,"" the CWC said.",2025-05-03 04:59:27,general,Negative

Joseph Czuba, 73, stabbed and killed Wadee Alfayoumi and knifed Hanan Shaheen days after U.S. ally Israel began its war on Gaza following Palestinian Hamas militants' October 7, 2023, attack on southern Israel. Prosecutors said the stabbing - one of the earliest and worst hate crime incidents in the U.S. since the start of the war - was sparked by anti-Muslim hatred. U.S. rights advocates have noted rising Islamophobia, anti-Arab hate and antisemitism. Czuba, who was the landlord for Shaheen and her son, stabbed the boy 26 times with a military-style knife with a 7-inch (18-cm) serrated blade, authorities said. Shaheen suffered multiple stab wounds in the attack that occurred in Plainfield Township, about 40 miles (64 km) southwest of Chicago.  Czuba was found guilty in late February. Shaheen testified during the trial that Czuba told her ""you, as a Muslim, must die."" Other recent incidents raising alarm in the U.S. about anti-Arab and anti-Palestinian prejudice include the attempted drowning of a 3-year-old Palestinian American girl and the stabbing of a Palestinian American man, both in Texas. Incidents raising alarm over antisemitism and anti-Israel attitudes include an unsuccessful plot to attack a New York Jewish center and an arson attack on Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro's residence. Hate incidents have also been reported during protests and counter-protests related to the war.

Mark Carney led the Liberal Party to a dramatic fourth mandate in elections on Monday after a campaign focused on the US president's threats to Canada's economy and sovereignty. Liberals fell just short of the 172 seats needed for majority control of parliament, but with 168 confirmed wins they will be in a strong position to pass legislation. At his first press conference since his victory, Mark Carney struck a determined note. Known for weighing his words carefully, he said that he was ""in politics to do great things, not to be something.""  ""And now that Canadians have honored me with a mandate to bring about big changes quickly, I will work relentlessly to fulfill that trust."" Canada's strained relations with the United States -- its historically close ally and biggest trading partner -- were his ""immediate priorities,"" he said, announcing a trip to Washington next Tuesday to meet with Trump on trade and security issues. Canadians, he noted, elected him ""to stand up to President Trump,"" adding that he will act ""with focus and determination."" ""Our focus will be on both immediate trade pressures and the broader future economic and security relationship between our two sovereign nations,"" said Carney. But he warned also not to expect any ""white smoke"" from their first meeting signaling a sudden breakthrough. Carney reiterated his message from throughout the campaign that he believes the old relationship between the two North American neighbors ""based on steadily increasing integration is over."" ""The questions now are how our nations will cooperate in the future,"" he said. Trump ""respects strength,"" he added, explaining that this was why he was preparing the country for major changes. The Conservatives, the main opposition party, as well as the Bloc Quebecois (the third-largest party in Parliament), both called for unity after the elections. Carney, who previously headed the Bank of Canada and the Bank of England, promised to maintain tariffs on American products as long as Washington's measures were in place. - 'Economic destiny' - ""This will be an incredibly exciting time as we take control of our economic destiny to create a new Canadian economy,"" Carney said. To this end, he promised to abolish existing trade barriers between provinces in Canada by July 1, and to strengthen trade with ""reliable allies."" ""Canada has what the world needs, and we uphold the values the world respects,"" he said. He announced also that he would unveil his new minority Liberal government in the week of May 12 and that parliament would return on May 26. King Charles III -- Canada's head of state, as it is a British Commonwealth country -- will deliver the opening speech, Carney said. ""This is a historic honor which matches the weigh of our times,"" he emphasized. ""It clearly demonstrates the sovereignty of our country,"" he said in a pointed reference to Trump's ambitions to make Canada the 51st American state. The ceremonial speech, which marks the opening of a new session of the Canadian Parliament, is usually delivered by the governor general, who is the King's representative in the country.

The statement came as the state entered a second year of living under immense hardships after the outbreak of ethnic violence between the Meitei community and the Kuki tribes on May 3, 2023. Recalling how the violence began two years ago to this day, the Meitei Alliance alleged armed aggression from Kuki militant groups funded by drug money carried out strategically orchestrated attacks to disrupt communal harmony and coerce the Manipur government into stopping its actions against cross-border drug trafficking, illegal opium poppy cultivation, encroachments on protected forest lands, and illegal immigration from Myanmar. ""Since then, Manipur has endured sustained unrest, severely affecting peace, security, and normal life across the state... Despite assuming control over the state's law and order situation, the central government's delayed and inadequate response allowed Kuki militants - operating under the SoO agreement - to carry out coordinated attacks against Meitei civilians,"" the Meitei Alliance said in the statement. ""The subsequent establishment of buffer zones by central forces, ostensibly to prevent further violence, inadvertently facilitated the creation of de facto enclaves that have since served as launchpads for continued terrorist operations targeting civilians,"" it said. The Meitei Alliance put forward seven points of actions that it suggested the Centre should consider taking up. One of the points stressed on intensifying the war on drugs campaign, including the complete eradication of illegal opium poppy cultivation. It sought carrying out the National Register of Citizens (NRC) exercise to detect foreigners.  ""Identify and deport illegal migrants from neighbouring countries. Dismantle artificial buffer zones and ensure unrestricted movement of all citizens across the state,"" the Meitei Alliance said. The Centre's order to ensure free movement across Manipur failed after the Kuki tribes protested against the decision.  ""The people of Manipur continue to suffer under the weight of prolonged violence and uncertainty. It is time for the government to act with resolve and ensure that the fundamental rights, safety, and dignity of every citizen are restored and protected,"" the Meitei Alliance said. The Meitei Alliance is one of the two organisations - the other is a key civil body of the indigenous distinct tribe Thadou - that met for the first time on a common platform and for a common goal since the outbreak of ethnic violence in Manipur in May 2023. The Meitei Alliance and the Thadou Inpi Manipur on March 8 called the development a ""significant and historic moment"". The Kuki tribes and the Meiteis have been fighting since May 2023 over a range of issues such as land rights and political representation.",2025-05-03 05:00:03,general,Negative
https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/donald-trump-eyes-huge-woke-cuts-in-budget-blueprint-8315623,Donald Trump Eyes Huge 'Woke' Cuts In Budget Blueprint,"May 02, 2025 23:11 pm IST","US President Donald Trump on Friday eyed massive cuts targeting ""woke"" and ""wasteful"" spending in his first budget blueprint since he returned to power, while boosting defense and border security. Republican Trump aims to cut non-defense spending by a huge $163 billion -- or 22 percent -- in 2026 as he digs in on the conservative, cost-cutting drive led by billionaire Elon Musk. Donald Trump would also massively cut foreign aid even while stepping up defense spending to $1.01 trillion and pouring money into homeland security as part of his anti-immigration drive. But the budget proposal is more of a wish-list at the start of Trump's second term and he faces a bitter battle in Congress, with Democrats calling it a ""gut punch"" that hammers health and education.  The White House said that many of the proposed cuts stemmed from the radical efforts by Musk's Department of Government Efficiency to slash the US government. ""We're joined at the hip with DOGE,"" an official from the White House's Office of Management and Budget told reporters in a call on condition of anonymity. ""This is a pretty historic effort to deal with the bureaucracy,"" the official said. ""It is woke and it is wasteful, and dividing us on the basis of race and identity in the country and honestly weaponized against it."" The White House provided an entire fact sheet on cuts to ""woke programs"", saying it was ""eliminating radical gender and racial ideologies that poison the minds of Americans"" and countering ""cultural Marxism."" Donald Trump's budget would also confirm the blow to foreign aid that his administration has already delivered since his inauguration in January. It would formalize the closure of the US international development agency USAID, dramatic cuts to which have already been widely criticized around the world. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio posted a link to the budget proposal on X, saying that thanks to Trump ""common sense leadership has been restored."" ""For far too long, Americans have had little to no return on their investment. Their tax dollars have been sent to unaccountable NGO's overseas to fund programs that do not serve our nation's interests. That's over,"" he said. 'Heartless' The boosts for the Pentagon and Homeland Security however reflect Trump's national security policies. US defense spending would rise 13 percent to what the OMB official called ""truly historic"" levels comparable to those last seen under Republican president Ronald Reagan in the 1980s. Homeland Security spending would rise a giant 65 percent as part of Trump's policy priority of cracking down on what he calls an ""invasion"" of undocumented migrants. Together the spending boost would ""at long last, fully secure our border,"" OMB chief Russ Vought said in a letter to Congress accompanying the budget proposal. The so-called ""skinny budget"" is often described as a wish-list that comes ahead of full budget proposals later in the year that must be agreed with Congress. But it is a revealing summary of Trump's focus in his new term, in which he has already sought to reshape the US government in his image. The Republican leader of the House of Representatives, Mike Johnson, hailed it as a ""bold blueprint."" But Republican leaders are already struggling to pass what Trump has called a ""big, beautiful bill"" for sweeping tax cuts. Top Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer said his party would ""fight this heartless budget with everything we've got."" ""Donald Trump's days of pretending to be a populist are over. His policies are nothing short of an all out assault on hardworking Americans,"" Schumer said in a statement.

Prince Harry, 40, stepped down from royal duties five years ago and moved to California. In 2023, he published his autobiography ""Spare"", which contained damning revelations about his father, King Charles and his elder brother, Prince William.  Harry last saw his father in February last year, shortly after Charles, 76, was diagnosed with cancer, when the pair had a short meeting in London. ON HIS RELATIONSHIP WITH HIS FATHER ""I don't know how much longer my father has. He won't speak to me because of this security stuff, but it would be nice to reconcile."" ON BROADER RECONCILIATION ""Of course some members my family will never forgive me for writing a book. Of course they will never forgive me for lots of things. But you know, there is, I would love...reconciliation with my family... there's no point in continuing to fight anymore. And life is precious."" ""It would be nice to have that reconciliation part. Now, if they don't want that, that's entirely up to them."" ON VISITING THE UK ""For the time being, it is impossible for me to take my family back to the UK safely."" ""I can't see a world in which I will be bringing my wife and children back to the UK at this point."" ""I miss the UK. I miss parts of the UK. Of course I do. And I think that it's really quite sad that I won't be able to show you know, my children."" ON THE COURT CASE OVER HIS SECURITY ""There is a lot of control and ability in my father's hands. Ultimately ...this whole thing, could be resolved through him, not necessarily by intervening, but by stepping aside, allowing the experts to do what is necessary."" ""There have been so many disagreements, differences between me and some of my family. This current situation that has been... now ongoing for five years, with regard to human life and safety, is the sticking point. It is the only thing that's left."" ""Security was used as leverage. I think what really worries me more than anything else about today's decision... is that it is setting the precedent that security can be used to control members of the (royal) family. And effectively what it does is imprison other members of the family from being able to choose a different life."" ON FORGIVING ""There are things that have happened, since 2016 especially - throughout my whole life, but let's just stick (to) since 2016, there are things that have happened that I can now forgive. I have moved past that. I can forgive my family's involvement, my father, my brother and my stepmother. I can forgive the press to a large extent as well, for so many things that have happened. What I'm struggling to forgive and what I will probably always struggle to forgive is that a decision that was made in 2020 that affects my every single day and that is knowingly putting me and my family in harm's way."" ON HISTORY REPEATING ITSELF ""I don't want history to repeat itself."" ""Through the disclosure process I've discovered that some people want history to repeat itself, which is pretty dark."" ""I'm not going to share (who) at this point. I know all the names of the people that were involved in this process.

From dusty desert towns to sun-splashed harbour cities, millions of Australians will choose between left-leaning incumbent Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and conservative challenger Peter Dutton. The almost universal consensus across a slew of opinion polls leading up to election day was that Albanese's governing Labor Party would win its second term. ""No one would deny these are uncertain times. And in times of uncertainty, we usually see voters swing towards incumbent governments,"" Roy Morgan pollster Michele Levine said as polling day approached. A total of 18.1 million voters have enrolled for the election. More than a third of them have cast an early ballot, the election authority says.  Voting is compulsory, enforced with fines of Aus$20 (US$13), leading to turnouts that top 90 percent. A result could come as soon as Saturday night, unless the vote is very tight. Albanese, 62, has promised to embrace renewable energy, tackle a worsening housing crisis, and pour money into a creaking healthcare system. Trump slump Liberal Party leader and former police officer Dutton, 54, wants to slash immigration, crack down on crime and ditch a longstanding ban on nuclear power. Some polls showed Dutton leaking support because of US President Donald Trump, who he praised this year as a ""big thinker"" with ""gravitas"" on the global stage. As Australians soured on Trump, both Dutton and Albanese took on a more pugnacious tone. ""If I needed to have a fight with Donald Trump or any other world leader, to advance our nation's interest, I'd do it in a heartbeat,"" Dutton said in April. Albanese condemned Trump's tariffs as an act of ""economic self-harm"" and ""not the act of a friend"". Economic concerns dominated the contest for the many Australian households struggling to pay inflated prices for milk, bread, power and petrol. ""The cost of living -- it's extremely high at the moment. So, taxes as well, is also another really big thing. Petrol prices, all the basic stuff,"" human resources manager Robyn Knox told AFP in Brisbane. Small business owner Jared Bell had similar concerns. ""Our grocery shops are definitely way more expensive than they were a couple years ago,"" he said. Campaign stumbles Both Albanese and Dutton tried to tout themselves as men of the people but were stumped when asked the price of eggs in a nationally televised debate. Coal-mining superpower Australia will choose between two leaders with sharply contrasting ideas on climate change and emissions reduction. Albanese's government has embraced the global push towards decarbonisation, warning of a future in which iron ore and polluting coal exports no longer prop up the economy. Dutton's signature policy is a US$200 billion scheme to construct seven industrial-scale nuclear reactors, doing away with the need to ramp up renewables. The 36-day campaign was a largely staid affair but there were a few moments of unscripted levity. Albanese tumbled backwards off the stage at a heaving campaign rally, while Dutton drew blood when he hit an unsuspecting cameraman in the head with a stray football. It remains to be seen whether Albanese or Dutton will command an outright majority, or whether they are forced to cobble together a coalition with the support of minor parties. Growing disenchantment among voters has emboldened independents pushing for greater transparency and climate progress. Polls have suggested 10 or more unaligned crossbenchers could hold the balance of power -- making a rare minority government a distinct possibility.

https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/us-to-stage-military-parade-on-june-14-donald-trumps-birthday-8316837,"US To Stage Military Parade On June 14, Trump's Birthday","May 03, 2025 04:10 am IST","The United States will stage a military parade on June 14 to mark the 250th anniversary of the founding of the US Army, the White House said Friday, with the event also falling on President Donald Trump's 79th birthday. Trump ""will honor American Veterans, active-duty servicemembers, and military history with a military parade!"" White House spokeswoman Anna Kelly wrote on X. In addition to the parade, the celebration of the service's birthday will feature fireworks and a festival on the National Mall, US Army spokeswoman Heather Hagan said. ""Given the significant milestone of 250 years, the Army is exploring options to make the celebration even bigger, with more capability demonstrations, additional displays of equipment, and more engagement with the community,"" Hagan said. ""Parade planning is actively underway, and we anticipate approximately 150 vehicles, 50 aircraft, and 6,600 soldiers,"" she added. Trump had floated the idea of holding a military parade in Washington during his first term after attending a Bastille Day parade in France.  It never materialized, however, after the Pentagon said it could cost $92 million and concerns were raised that tanks and other heavy military vehicles would damage the city's streets. Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser raised similar concerns last month when asked by reporters about plans for a parade. ""Military tanks on our streets would not be good,"" Bowser said. ""If military tanks were used they should be accompanied with many millions of dollars to repair the roads."" - 'We never celebrate anything' - The last major US military parade in Washington was held in 1991 to celebrate the end of the Gulf War. The new parade announcement came a day after Trump said he was declaring May 8 to be Victory Day for World War II and changing Veterans Day -- observed on November 11 -- to Victory Day for World War I. In a post on his Truth Social platform, the US president downplayed the role of European countries -- many of which suffered far more casualties and devastation than the United States -- in the two global conflicts. ""We won both Wars, nobody was close to us in terms of strength, bravery, or military brilliance, but we never celebrate anything -- That's because we don't have leaders anymore, that know how to do so! We are going to start celebrating our victories again!"" Trump wrote. Trump has had a contradictory relationship with US military forces, lauding their power but also claiming they were depleted and in need of rebuilding. He at times clashed with military brass during his 2016-2020 term in office and reportedly referred to fallen troops as ""losers"" and ""suckers"" -- something he denied. During his second term, Trump has overseen a purge of top officers, including chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff general Charles ""CQ"" Brown, whom he fired without explanation in February. Other senior officers dismissed this year include the heads of the Navy and Coast Guard, the general who headed the National Security Agency, the vice chief of staff of the Air Force, a Navy admiral assigned to NATO, and three top military lawyers. US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has insisted the president is simply choosing the leaders he wants, but Democratic lawmakers have raised concerns about the potential politicization of the traditionally neutral US military.

Asked about the report, a CIA spokesperson did not confirm the specifics, but said that Director John Ratcliffe ""is moving swiftly to ensure the CIA workforce is responsive to the administration's national security priorities."" ""These moves are part of a holistic strategy to infuse the agency with renewed energy, provide opportunities for rising leaders to emerge, and better position CIA to deliver on its mission,"" the spokesperson said. The CIA earlier this year became the first US intelligence agency to join a voluntary redundancy program initiated by President Donald Trump, who has vowed to radically downsize the federal workforce in the name of efficiency and frugality.  Ratcliffe previously told lawmakers that under his leadership, the agency would ""produce insightful, objective, all-source analysis, never allowing political or personal biases to cloud our judgment or infect our products.""

Yunus' interim government on Friday distanced itself from the remarks made by Major General (Retd) ALM Fazlur Rahman on his social media account. In a Facebook post on Tuesday, Rahman wrote in Bengali, ""If India attacks Pakistan, Bangladesh should occupy the seven states of Northeastern India."" ""I think it is necessary to start discussions with China on a joint military arrangement in this regard,"" he added. Rahman was appointed by the Yunus-led interim government in December 2024 as the chairman of the National Independent Commission assigned to investigate the killings in the Bangladesh Rifles revolt of 2009.  Distancing itself from the former army officer's remarks, Bangladesh's Ministry of Foreign Affairs in a media release on Friday said, ""The comments do not reflect the position or policies of the government of Bangladesh, and as such, the government neither endorses nor supports such rhetoric in any form or manner."" The government urged all concerned to refrain from associating the state with the personal views expressed by Rahman, the Dhaka Tribune newspaper reported. Bangladesh remains firmly committed to the principles of sovereignty, territorial integrity, mutual respect, and the peaceful coexistence of all nations, the ministry said. Earlier in March, Chief Adviser Yunus, during his visit to China, had remarked that India's seven northeastern states, which share a nearly 1,600-km border with Bangladesh, are landlocked and have no way to reach the ocean except through his country. In his address at a business event in China, Yunus said Dhaka was the ""only guardian"" of the Indian Ocean in the region, as he invited Beijing to send goods through Bangladesh across the world. The comments did not go down well in New Delhi. It also drew sharp reactions from political leaders in India across party lines. Days after Yunus' controversial remarks, India in April withdrew the transhipment facility it had granted to Bangladesh for exporting goods to the Middle East, Europe and various other countries except Nepal and Bhutan. Bangladesh has been using several Indian ports and airports for its exports to West Asia, Europe, and many other countries. India has exempted Bangladeshi exports to Nepal and Bhutan, as such trade facilitation is mandatory for landlocked countries under the framework of provisions of the World Trade Organisation (WTO). India-Bangladesh relation has nosedived after Yunus failed to contain attacks on minorities, especially Hindus, in that country after the fall of Sheikh Hasina's Awami League government in August last year.

Mr Channi later said he had not sought proof and that the Congress stands with the government ""like a rock"" as it takes measures against Pakistan following last week's attack.  Addressing a press conference on Friday after a meeting of the Congress Working Committee (CWC) - the party's highest decision-making body - in which a strong resolution urging the Centre to penalise Pakistan for the Pahalgam attack was passed, Mr Channi said the surgical strike ""could not be seen"". Appearing to confuse the 2019 Balakot air strike and the 2016 surgical strike, Mr Channi, who is a former Punjab chief minister, said in Hindi, ""If a bomb is dropped on our country, would we not know? They say we had conducted a surgical strike in Pakistan... nothing happened, the surgical strikes could not be seen, nobody found out."" Asked if he was seeking proof of the strike, Mr Channi continued, ""I have been demanding it since the beginning. But the need of the hour is to heal the wounds of the people of our country. We demand that (the Centre) do something, identify (those behind the Pahalgam attack) and punish them."" The BJP pounced on Mr Channi's remarks and accused him and the Congress of questioning the armed forces. Party leader and Delhi Minister Manjinder Singh Sirsa said in Hindi, ""The Congress has questioned the Army and the Air Force again. Charanjit Singh Channi has said again that he does not believe that the surgical strike was carried out and that he wants proof. What kind of mindset does the Congress and the Gandhi family have that they repeatedly accuse the Army and Air Force of lying and say that Pakistan is telling the truth? This is despite Pakistan itself saying the surgical strike was carried out."" Mr Sirsa also accused the Congress MP of indulging in politics at a time when people have lost their lives in a terror attack. ""If you want proof so badly, visit Pakistan with (Congress MP and Leader of the Opposition) Rahul Gandhi and check where the surgical strike was done,"" he added.

""I have said earlier as well that the Congress party, in this hour of grief, is standing by the government.

Uri Attack, Response In September 2016, the Army's brigade headquarters was attacked near the town of Uri in Jammu and Kashmir by four terrorists from the Pakistan-based terror organisation Jaish-e-Mohammed. The terrorists lobbed grenades and opened fire, after which a gunbattle began. The attack claimed the lives of 19 soldiers and over 20 others were injured. Days later, on September 29, Indian Army teams crossed the Line of Control and attacked terror launch pads in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. Several terrorists were killed in the surgical strike and the Army said it had taken the action because it had received intelligence that terrorist attacks were being planned against India. Congress Resolution In its resolution, the Congress Working Committee said this was the time to teach Pakistan a lesson and curb terrorism effectively. ""The masterminds and perpetrators of this cowardly attack must face full consequences for their actions. The Congress urges the Government of India to act with firmness, strategic clarity and international coordination to isolate and penalise Pakistan for its continued export of terror into our territory,"" the resolution stated. ""The entire country awaits accountability, answers and justice.

Joseph Czuba, 73, stabbed and killed Wadee Alfayoumi and knifed Hanan Shaheen days after U.S. ally Israel began its war on Gaza following Palestinian Hamas militants' October 7, 2023, attack on southern Israel. Prosecutors said the stabbing - one of the earliest and worst hate crime incidents in the U.S. since the start of the war - was sparked by anti-Muslim hatred. U.S. rights advocates have noted rising Islamophobia, anti-Arab hate and antisemitism. Czuba, who was the landlord for Shaheen and her son, stabbed the boy 26 times with a military-style knife with a 7-inch (18-cm) serrated blade, authorities said.

Mark Carney led the Liberal Party to a dramatic fourth mandate in elections on Monday after a campaign focused on the US president's threats to Canada's economy and sovereignty. Liberals fell just short of the 172 seats needed for majority control of parliament, but with 168 confirmed wins they will be in a strong position to pass legislation. At his first press conference since his victory, Mark Carney struck a determined note. Known for weighing his words carefully, he said that he was ""in politics to do great things, not to be something.""  ""And now that Canadians have honored me with a mandate to bring about big changes quickly, I will work relentlessly to fulfill that trust."" Canada's strained relations with the United States -- its historically close ally and biggest trading partner -- were his ""immediate priorities,"" he said, announcing a trip to Washington next Tuesday to meet with Trump on trade and security issues. Canadians, he noted, elected him ""to stand up to President Trump,"" adding that he will act ""with focus and determination."" ""Our focus will be on both immediate trade pressures and the broader future economic and security relationship between our two sovereign nations,"" said Carney. But he warned also not to expect any ""white smoke"" from their first meeting signaling a sudden breakthrough. Carney reiterated his message from throughout the campaign that he believes the old relationship between the two North American neighbors ""based on steadily increasing integration is over."" ""The questions now are how our nations will cooperate in the future,"" he said. Trump ""respects strength,"" he added, explaining that this was why he was preparing the country for major changes. The Conservatives, the main opposition party, as well as the Bloc Quebecois (the third-largest party in Parliament), both called for unity after the elections. Carney, who previously headed the Bank of Canada and the Bank of England, promised to maintain tariffs on American products as long as Washington's measures were in place. - 'Economic destiny' - ""This will be an incredibly exciting time as we take control of our economic destiny to create a new Canadian economy,"" Carney said. To this end, he promised to abolish existing trade barriers between provinces in Canada by July 1, and to strengthen trade with ""reliable allies."" ""Canada has what the world needs, and we uphold the values the world respects,"" he said. He announced also that he would unveil his new minority Liberal government in the week of May 12 and that parliament would return on May 26. King Charles III -- Canada's head of state, as it is a British Commonwealth country -- will deliver the opening speech, Carney said. ""This is a historic honor which matches the weigh of our times,"" he emphasized. ""It clearly demonstrates the sovereignty of our country,"" he said in a pointed reference to Trump's ambitions to make Canada the 51st American state. The ceremonial speech, which marks the opening of a new session of the Canadian Parliament, is usually delivered by the governor general, who is the King's representative in the country.

He referenced the terrorist attack that occurred in Pahalgam, Jammu and Kashmir, on April 22, where 26 tourists were killed.

By equating a simple cultural request to sing a Kannada song with a terrorist act, Shri Nigam has portrayed Kannadigas as intolerant or violent, which is contrary to their peace-loving and harmonious nature. His statement risks sparking linguistic unrest in Karnataka, a state known for its diversity.

The statement came as the state entered a second year of living under immense hardships after the outbreak of ethnic violence between the Meitei community and the Kuki tribes on May 3, 2023. Recalling how the violence began two years ago to this day, the Meitei Alliance alleged armed aggression from Kuki militant groups funded by drug money carried out strategically orchestrated attacks to disrupt communal harmony and coerce the Manipur government into stopping its actions against cross-border drug trafficking, illegal opium poppy cultivation, encroachments on protected forest lands, and illegal immigration from Myanmar. ""Since then, Manipur has endured sustained unrest, severely affecting peace, security, and normal life across the state... Despite assuming control over the state's law and order situation, the central government's delayed and inadequate response allowed Kuki militants - operating under the SoO agreement - to carry out coordinated attacks against Meitei civilians,"" the Meitei Alliance said in the statement. ""The subsequent establishment of buffer zones by central forces, ostensibly to prevent further violence, inadvertently facilitated the creation of de facto enclaves that have since served as launchpads for continued terrorist operations targeting civilians,"" it said. The Meitei Alliance put forward seven points of actions that it suggested the Centre should consider taking up. One of the points stressed on intensifying the war on drugs campaign, including the complete eradication of illegal opium poppy cultivation. It sought carrying out the National Register of Citizens (NRC) exercise to detect foreigners.  ""Identify and deport illegal migrants from neighbouring countries. Dismantle artificial buffer zones and ensure unrestricted movement of all citizens across the state,"" the Meitei Alliance said. The Centre's order to ensure free movement across Manipur failed after the Kuki tribes protested against the decision.  ""The people of Manipur continue to suffer under the weight of prolonged violence and uncertainty. It is time for the government to act with resolve and ensure that the fundamental rights, safety, and dignity of every citizen are restored and protected,"" the Meitei Alliance said.

Republican Trump aims to cut non-defense spending by a huge $163 billion -- or 22 percent -- in 2026 as he digs in on the conservative, cost-cutting drive led by billionaire Elon Musk. Donald Trump would also massively cut foreign aid even while stepping up defense spending to $1.01 trillion and pouring money into homeland security as part of his anti-immigration drive. But the budget proposal is more of a wish-list at the start of Trump's second term and he faces a bitter battle in Congress, with Democrats calling it a ""gut punch"" that hammers health and education.  The White House said that many of the proposed cuts stemmed from the radical efforts by Musk's Department of Government Efficiency to slash the US government. ""We're joined at the hip with DOGE,"" an official from the White House's Office of Management and Budget told reporters in a call on condition of anonymity. ""This is a pretty historic effort to deal with the bureaucracy,"" the official said. ""It is woke and it is wasteful, and dividing us on the basis of race and identity in the country and honestly weaponized against it."" The White House provided an entire fact sheet on cuts to ""woke programs"", saying it was ""eliminating radical gender and racial ideologies that poison the minds of Americans"" and countering ""cultural Marxism."" Donald Trump's budget would also confirm the blow to foreign aid that his administration has already delivered since his inauguration in January. It would formalize the closure of the US international development agency USAID, dramatic cuts to which have already been widely criticized around the world. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio posted a link to the budget proposal on X, saying that thanks to Trump ""common sense leadership has been restored."" ""For far too long, Americans have had little to no return on their investment. Their tax dollars have been sent to unaccountable NGO's overseas to fund programs that do not serve our nation's interests. That's over,"" he said. 'Heartless' The boosts for the Pentagon and Homeland Security however reflect Trump's national security policies. US defense spending would rise 13 percent to what the OMB official called ""truly historic"" levels comparable to those last seen under Republican president Ronald Reagan in the 1980s. Homeland Security spending would rise a giant 65 percent as part of Trump's policy priority of cracking down on what he calls an ""invasion"" of undocumented migrants. Together the spending boost would ""at long last, fully secure our border,"" OMB chief Russ Vought said in a letter to Congress accompanying the budget proposal. The so-called ""skinny budget"" is often described as a wish-list that comes ahead of full budget proposals later in the year that must be agreed with Congress. But it is a revealing summary of Trump's focus in his new term, in which he has already sought to reshape the US government in his image. The Republican leader of the House of Representatives, Mike Johnson, hailed it as a ""bold blueprint."" But Republican leaders are already struggling to pass what Trump has called a ""big, beautiful bill"" for sweeping tax cuts. Top Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer said his party would ""fight this heartless budget with everything we've got."" ""Donald Trump's days of pretending to be a populist are over. His policies are nothing short of an all out assault on hardworking Americans,"" Schumer said in a statement.

""There have been so many disagreements, differences between me and some of my family. This current situation that has been... now ongoing for five years, with regard to human life and safety, is the sticking point. It is the only thing that's left."" ""Security was used as leverage. I think what really worries me more than anything else about today's decision... is that it is setting the precedent that security can be used to control members of the (royal) family.

From dusty desert towns to sun-splashed harbour cities, millions of Australians will choose between left-leaning incumbent Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and conservative challenger Peter Dutton. The almost universal consensus across a slew of opinion polls leading up to election day was that Albanese's governing Labor Party would win its second term. ""No one would deny these are uncertain times. And in times of uncertainty, we usually see voters swing towards incumbent governments,"" Roy Morgan pollster Michele Levine said as polling day approached. A total of 18.1 million voters have enrolled for the election. More than a third of them have cast an early ballot, the election authority says.  Voting is compulsory, enforced with fines of Aus$20 (US$13), leading to turnouts that top 90 percent. A result could come as soon as Saturday night, unless the vote is very tight. Albanese, 62, has promised to embrace renewable energy, tackle a worsening housing crisis, and pour money into a creaking healthcare system. Trump slump Liberal Party leader and former police officer Dutton, 54, wants to slash immigration, crack down on crime and ditch a longstanding ban on nuclear power. Some polls showed Dutton leaking support because of US President Donald Trump, who he praised this year as a ""big thinker"" with ""gravitas"" on the global stage. As Australians soured on Trump, both Dutton and Albanese took on a more pugnacious tone. ""If I needed to have a fight with Donald Trump or any other world leader, to advance our nation's interest, I'd do it in a heartbeat,"" Dutton said in April. Albanese condemned Trump's tariffs as an act of ""economic self-harm"" and ""not the act of a friend"". Economic concerns dominated the contest for the many Australian households struggling to pay inflated prices for milk, bread, power and petrol. ""The cost of living -- it's extremely high at the moment. So, taxes as well, is also another really big thing. Petrol prices, all the basic stuff,"" human resources manager Robyn Knox told AFP in Brisbane. Small business owner Jared Bell had similar concerns. ""Our grocery shops are definitely way more expensive than they were a couple years ago,"" he said. Campaign stumbles Both Albanese and Dutton tried to tout themselves as men of the people but were stumped when asked the price of eggs in a nationally televised debate. Coal-mining superpower Australia will choose between two leaders with sharply contrasting ideas on climate change and emissions reduction. Albanese's government has embraced the global push towards decarbonisation, warning of a future in which iron ore and polluting coal exports no longer prop up the economy. Dutton's signature policy is a US$200 billion scheme to construct seven industrial-scale nuclear reactors, doing away with the need to ramp up renewables. The 36-day campaign was a largely staid affair but there were a few moments of unscripted levity. Albanese tumbled backwards off the stage at a heaving campaign rally, while Dutton drew blood when he hit an unsuspecting cameraman in the head with a stray football. It remains to be seen whether Albanese or Dutton will command an outright majority, or whether they are forced to cobble together a coalition with the support of minor parties. Growing disenchantment among voters has emboldened independents pushing for greater transparency and climate progress. Polls have suggested 10 or more unaligned crossbenchers could hold the balance of power -- making a rare minority government a distinct possibility.

He looked for an open space to land but had to settle for a swamp near a lagoon. The five found themselves ""surrounded by alligators that came within three meters of us,"" Velarde said, adding he suspected that the kerosene leaking from the plane had kept the toothy predators at bay.

The Lucknow bench of the court said a relative's wedding overseas and a pleasure trip to another country are not considered essential reasons for an undertrial accused to travel internationally. Justice Subhash Vidyarthi delivered the verdict while dismissing a plea filed by Aditya Murti, a consultant at the Shri Ram Murti Smarak Institute of Medical Sciences, Bareilly. Murti had sought permission to travel to the United States for his relative's wedding and subsequently, to France for a related celebration from May 3 to 22. ""An accused person who has been enlarged on bail can be granted permission to travel abroad for some pressing necessity like medical treatment, attending essential official duties and the like,"" the bench clarified, adding that attending a relative's wedding does not constitute a pressing necessity. Furthermore, the court addressed the petitioner's argument that he was previously granted permission for foreign travel for non-essential purposes. ""Merely because the trial court had earlier granted permission to the applicant to travel abroad for non-essential objects on numerous occasions, he does not get a right to travel abroad for non-essential objects this time also, when the trial has reached the stage of defence evidence,"" it said.  Murti had challenged a special CBI court's April 24 order that rejected his application for the foreign trip. Murti has been facing trial in a CBI case for more than a decade and even the Supreme Court had directed the trial court to expedite the proceedings, which are currently at the defence-evidence stage.

Named WD 1856+534 b, the exoplanet is a gas giant, located 81 light-years from Earth and sheds light on how planets evolve during the final stages of a star's life. While the exoplanet was first spotted in 2020, an international team of researchers last week published their findings about it. Using the Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) aboard the JWST, the scientists stated that temperatures reached a frigid -125 degrees Fahrenheit (-87 degrees Celsius), making it the coldest planet ever directly observed. ""We were all a bit surprised - and excited - to find that it was, in fact, a planet, and a really cold one at that,"" Mary Anne Limbach, an astronomer at the University of Michigan, who led the new study toldSpace.com. The previous record for the coldest planet was held by Epsilon Indi Ab, which stands at around 35 degrees Fahrenheit (2 degrees Celsius). ""The detection of WD 1856 b, with its sub-200 K temperature, marks significant progress in directly detecting exoplanets with thermal emission similar in temperature to Solar System gas giants,"" thestudyhighlighted. Also Read | Scientists Uncover Secret To Success Of Steve Jobs, Mark Zuckerberg And Bill Gates The researchers further confirmed that the exoplanet has a mass no greater than six times that of Jupiter and orbits the remnant core of a once sun-like star, every 1.4 days. Scientists added that it was the first intact exoplanet to have been found in the forbidden zone of a star.  ""WD 1856+534 b is now the first intact exoplanet confirmed within a white dwarf's ""forbidden zone,"" a region where planets would have been engulfed during the star's red giant phase. Its presence provides direct evidence that planetary migration into close orbits-including the habitable zone-around white dwarfs is possible."" Ms Limbach said their findings provide ""compelling evidence"" that not only can planets survive the violent death of their star but also move into orbits where previously they would have not expected them to exist. Buoyed by the success, the researchers are hoping that JWST's full potential could be used to directly image even colder gas giants in closer systems with ""temperatures as low as 75 K"". This capability could provide an opportunity to explore the atmospheres and thermal properties of planets with temperatures comparable to the coldest gas giants in our Solar System.",2025-05-03 11:14:07,general,Positive
https://www.ndtv.com/travel/travel-smart-booking-hacks-flights-hotels-8318315,"Travel Smart: 8 Booking Hacks That'll Save You Serious Cash On Flights, Hotels And More","May 03, 2025 10:39 am IST","If there's one thing better than booking a holiday, it's saving a boatload of money while doing it. Whether you're planning a quick city break or a long-haul escape, cutting down on travel costs can mean splashing out on a few more cocktails poolside — or simply stretching your budget a bit further. Luckily, scoring a deal doesn't mean refreshing airline pages for hours or gambling on shady last-minute sites. With a few clever hacks, you can seriously cut down on the cost of flights, accommodation, and everything in between. Here's what savvy travellers swear by. Also Read:Why You Need An eSIM For Your Next Trip And How It Will Change The Way You Travel  You've probably used Skyscanner, Google Flights or Kayak before. They're brilliant for comparing prices across airlines, but don't take them at face value. Always double-check prices on the airline's official website before booking. Why? Some budget airlines charge less if you book direct, especially in Europe. Plus, booking direct often comes with more flexible cancellation policies or fewer sneaky fees. Top tip: Clear your cookies or browse in incognito mode. Dynamic pricing is real-many sites hike up prices if they know you're interested. Yes, the day you book and fly does matter. According to data from Google Flights and Expedia,booking your flightson a Tuesday or Wednesday often nets the lowest fares. As for travel days? Flying on a Tuesday or Saturday tends to be cheaper than departing on Friday or Sunday, which are peak travel days. Bonus: Early-morning or red-eye flights usually cost less too. Not glamorous, but your wallet will thank you. Budget carriers like Ryanair, EasyJet, and Wizz Air offer ultra-cheap fares across Europe and beyond — but they make their money on extras. Seats, luggage, even printing your boarding pass can cost you. Hack it: Travel with just a backpack or small cabin bag (check airline dimensions carefully), and skip seat selection if you're not fussed. If you're flying with someone, book tickets separately-sometimes two singles are cheaper than booking together. If your dates are flexible, you've got way more chances to save. Use price alert features on Hopper, Skyscanner or Google Flights to get notified when prices drop. Some apps even tell you whether to book now or wait. Google Flights also has a handy calendar view showing which days are cheaper-perfect if you've got wiggle room. Compare prices on different sites or apps. Photo: iStock Chain hotels are convenient, but often not the cheapest or most characterful. Try locally-owned stays, boutique hotels or hostels with private rooms. Sites like Booking.com and Agoda offer great filters to find these gems. If you want hotel-like perks but a better deal, check out ""soft brands"" like Marriott's Autograph Collection or Hilton's Curio Collection. They're independently run hotels that still offer loyalty perks-but with more competitive pricing. Airbnb isn't always cheaper-especially after cleaning and service fees. For short stays (1-2 nights), a hotel might actually be a better deal. But for longer trips, especially with friends or family, splitting an Airbnb can save serious money. Extra win: You can cook your own meals. Even if it's just breakfast, that's a few pounds saved every day. Also Read:8 Smart Ways To Keep Track Of The Weather And Pack Like A Pro Don't sleep on cashback websites like TopCashback or Quidco. You can often get 5-10% back on bookings from Expedia, Hotels.com, Booking.com, and even some airlines. Also, sign up for airline and hotel loyalty programmes — they're free and sometimes offer instant perks like free Wi-Fi, early check-in, or extra baggage. Even if you only travel a couple of times a year, the points can add up. Flying into a smaller or alternative airport can be drastically cheaper. For example, flying into Girona instead of Barcelona, or Milan Bergamo instead of Milan Malpensa. Pair this with cheap ground transport (hello, FlixBus or regional trains) and you're golden. Just make sure you factor in the travel time and cost so it's still worth it.",2025-05-03 11:14:09,general,Positive

The Museum of East Bohemia, which took possession of the items said that the hikers had found 598 gold coins, jewellry and tobacco bags, cumulatively weighing around 15 pounds. The coins appear to have been ""hidden in the ground for over a hundred years"" and are dated from 1808 to the early 19th century. The coins are believed to have been likely buried after 1921 and include currency from France, Belgium, the Ottoman Empire and former Austria-Hungary. ""When he [one of the hikers] opened it, my jaw dropped,"" said Miroslav Novak, head of archaeology at the museum. Calling the collection a ""very specific set"", the local media reported that small marks on the currency indicate that they were minted for use in former Yugoslavia, which existed from 1918 to 1992. Also Read | Scientists Uncover Secret To Success Of Steve Jobs, Mark Zuckerberg And Bill Gates Though the discovery was made in February, it was only last week that the museum officials made the information public. ""We will need to analyse the rest, but at the current price of precious metals, the value of the find can start at 7.5 million [Czech] Crowns ($340,000),""saidMr Novak. Experts are now trying to determine how the treasure ended buried up on the side of the mountain. ""To store valuable objects in the ground in the form of treasures, so-called depots have been a common practice since prehistoric times. At first, religious movements were more common; later it was property stored in uncertain times with the intention of returning later for it."" One of the prevailing theories is that the treasure could have been hidden by Nazis retreating from advancing Russian forces when they were ousted at the end of World War II.  “It is difficult to say whether this is the gold of a Czech who had to leave the occupied territory after the Nazi invasion of 1938 [or] the gold of a German who feared displacement after 1945,” said museum director Petr Grulich. “It could also be stolen goods from an antique shop, but we are not inclined to this option.” While the investigation continues, the lucky hikers will get around 10 per cent of the discovery's total value, following Czech law.",2025-05-03 11:14:21,general,Positive

The videos, which are just over two minutes long and are presented in Mandarin with Chinese subtitles, represent a major shift in the CIA's approach to hiring officials in China. The US views China as its main military and strategic adversary. One of the videos portrays the internal turmoil of a high-ranking Chinese Communist Party official. The video shows the official is haunted by the growing unpredictability of Chinese President Xi Jinping's sweeping anti-corruption drive. “As I rise within the party, I watch those above me being discarded like worn-out shoes, but now I realise that my fate was just as precarious as theirs,” the narrator reflects, accompanied by visuals of surveillance and hushed anxiety. The other video is about a young government employee disillusioned by the stark gap between the party's promises and the lived reality of common citizens. The protagonist toils through bureaucratic drudgery and late nights, only to return to a cramped apartment shared with his parents.  “From a young age, the party taught us that as long as we diligently followed the path laid out by our leaders, we would have a bright future,” the narrator laments. Both narratives culminate with the characters reaching out to the CIA through its secure online platform — an invitation introduced by the agency last year through a simple text video. That previous effort provided step-by-step instructions in Chinese for contacting the agency. It formed part of a broader campaign to gather intelligence from hard-to-penetrate countries like China, Iran and North Korea. Both videos can be found on YouTube and are titled in Chinese. One is called, “Why I contacted the CIA: to take control of my fate,” and the other is titled, “Why I contacted the CIA: for a better life.” Watch the videos here:  These videos reflect a more aggressive push in CIA's outreach initiatives. It shows the agency's conviction that, in spite of strict internet regulations, its messaging is effectively reaching audiences within China. “If it weren't working, we wouldn't be making more videos,”Reutersquoted a CIA official as saying. The official said that the US was not just interested in counterintelligence, but was also seeking information on advanced science, military and cyber technology, valuable economic data, and China's foreign policy secrets.

What Led To Deadly Stampede At Goa Temple","May 03, 2025 09:58 am IST","A stampede left at least six dead and dozens injured at a temple in the coastal city of Goa last night. The incident occurred during a large gathering at theShirgaon temple. The devotees were participating in an annual procession when panic spread through the crowd, causing a sudden rush. Eyewitnesses have described a chaotic scene at the temple when the tragedy struck. Lairai Jatra The Shirgaon temple was packed with devotees for the Lairai Devi jatra, the procession of Goddess Lairai and her siblings held annually during April or May. Lairai, who is believed to be an incarnation of Goddess Parvati, is among the seven sister deities in Goan folklore. The festival draws a huge number of devotees from across Goa, Maharashtra, and Karnataka. An elaborate security arrangement was made for the grand event last night in coordination with the temple committee. Over a thousand police personnel were deployed at the temple, including a Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP)-level officer. Dozens of other senior officers and hundreds of constables and women cops were part of the security structure. Several officers were in civilian clothes to prevent pickpocketing. The Goa Reserve Police Force was also on the ground. To ensure smooth traffic, over 300 traffic police personnel were deployed. The police used drone surveillance to keep an eye on the crowd. A Vajra Van, or riot control vehicle, was also on standby.  What Led To Stampede Midnight visuals showed a crowd of devotees gathered around a huge fire at the temple for a custom that involves sitting around the fire and making wishes. Devotees believe their wishes come true if they participate in this ritual. Some even walk on embers for a ritual called 'agnidivya'. But it is not known if people were taking part in the custom at the time of the stampede. Around 4-4:30 am, a sudden rush was seen among the crowd. Panic spread and chaotic scenes unfolded as devotees started jostling to escape, as described by eyewitnesses. Initial reports suggest overcrowding and a lack of crowd control measures led to the rush. Chief Minister Pramod Sawant said a sudden electric shock is said to have sparked panic in the crowd. But the exact cause is not known yet. The emergency services were put on alert. The police rushed to the stampede site and began rescue operations. At least six people, including a 17-year-old boy, lost their lives in the stampede while 50 others suffered serious injuries. The injured were taken to nearby hospitals. Authorities' Response Mr Sawant said the injured are being treated at the Goa Medical College and North Goa District Hospital. Additional teams of doctors were deployed at these two hospitals. The Chief Minister met the injured at the hospital and is monitoring the situation. Every necessary measure is being taken, he assured, adding that Prime Minister Narendra Modi has taken detailed stock of the situation. PM Modi also offered condolences and wished a speedy recovery to the injured. ""Saddened by the loss of lives due to a stampede in Shirgao, Goa. Condolences to those who lost their loved ones. May the injured recover soon. The local administration is assisting those affected,"" said the Prime Minister.

Everyone on board -- three women, a child, and the 29-year-old pilot -- were rescued from their perch atop the capsized plane in ""excellent condition,"" said Wilson Avila, director of the emergency operations center in the Beni region. The plane was flying from the town of Baures to the north-central city of Trinidad, 180 kilometers (112 miles) away, when it ran into trouble. Andres Velarde, the 29-year-old pilot of the single-engine aircraft, told local media from his hospital bed that the plane suddenly began to lose altitude.  He looked for an open space to land but had to settle for a swamp near a lagoon. The five found themselves ""surrounded by alligators that came within three meters of us,"" Velarde said, adding he suspected that the kerosene leaking from the plane had kept the toothy predators at bay. He said they also saw an anaconda in the murky waters. For sustenance, they ate a local cassava flour that one of the passengers had brought on the trip. ""We couldn't drink water and we couldn't go anywhere else because of the alligators,"" Velarde said. The five were rescued after being spotted by local fishermen and taken to hospital. People frequently use air taxis in the Beni area, due to the lack of paved roads and the poor maintenance of those that do exist.

The Lucknow bench of the court said a relative's wedding overseas and a pleasure trip to another country are not considered essential reasons for an undertrial accused to travel internationally. Justice Subhash Vidyarthi delivered the verdict while dismissing a plea filed by Aditya Murti, a consultant at the Shri Ram Murti Smarak Institute of Medical Sciences, Bareilly. Murti had sought permission to travel to the United States for his relative's wedding and subsequently, to France for a related celebration from May 3 to 22. ""An accused person who has been enlarged on bail can be granted permission to travel abroad for some pressing necessity like medical treatment, attending essential official duties and the like,"" the bench clarified, adding that attending a relative's wedding does not constitute a pressing necessity. Furthermore, the court addressed the petitioner's argument that he was previously granted permission for foreign travel for non-essential purposes. ""Merely because the trial court had earlier granted permission to the applicant to travel abroad for non-essential objects on numerous occasions, he does not get a right to travel abroad for non-essential objects this time also, when the trial has reached the stage of defence evidence,"" it said.  Murti had challenged a special CBI court's April 24 order that rejected his application for the foreign trip. Murti has been facing trial in a CBI case for more than a decade and even the Supreme Court had directed the trial court to expedite the proceedings, which are currently at the defence-evidence stage.

Named WD 1856+534 b, the exoplanet is a gas giant, located 81 light-years from Earth and sheds light on how planets evolve during the final stages of a star's life. While the exoplanet was first spotted in 2020, an international team of researchers last week published their findings about it. Using the Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) aboard the JWST, the scientists stated that temperatures reached a frigid -125 degrees Fahrenheit (-87 degrees Celsius), making it the coldest planet ever directly observed. ""We were all a bit surprised - and excited - to find that it was, in fact, a planet, and a really cold one at that,"" Mary Anne Limbach, an astronomer at the University of Michigan, who led the new study toldSpace.com. The previous record for the coldest planet was held by Epsilon Indi Ab, which stands at around 35 degrees Fahrenheit (2 degrees Celsius). ""The detection of WD 1856 b, with its sub-200 K temperature, marks significant progress in directly detecting exoplanets with thermal emission similar in temperature to Solar System gas giants,"" thestudyhighlighted. Also Read | Scientists Uncover Secret To Success Of Steve Jobs, Mark Zuckerberg And Bill Gates The researchers further confirmed that the exoplanet has a mass no greater than six times that of Jupiter and orbits the remnant core of a once sun-like star, every 1.4 days. Scientists added that it was the first intact exoplanet to have been found in the forbidden zone of a star.  ""WD 1856+534 b is now the first intact exoplanet confirmed within a white dwarf's ""forbidden zone,"" a region where planets would have been engulfed during the star's red giant phase. Its presence provides direct evidence that planetary migration into close orbits-including the habitable zone-around white dwarfs is possible."" Ms Limbach said their findings provide ""compelling evidence"" that not only can planets survive the violent death of their star but also move into orbits where previously they would have not expected them to exist. Buoyed by the success, the researchers are hoping that JWST's full potential could be used to directly image even colder gas giants in closer systems with ""temperatures as low as 75 K"". This capability could provide an opportunity to explore the atmospheres and thermal properties of planets with temperatures comparable to the coldest gas giants in our Solar System.",2025-05-03 11:14:07,general,Positive
https://www.ndtv.com/travel/travel-smart-booking-hacks-flights-hotels-8318315,"Travel Smart: 8 Booking Hacks That'll Save You Serious Cash On Flights, Hotels And More","May 03, 2025 10:39 am IST","If there's one thing better than booking a holiday, it's saving a boatload of money while doing it. Whether you're planning a quick city break or a long-haul escape, cutting down on travel costs can mean splashing out on a few more cocktails poolside — or simply stretching your budget a bit further. Luckily, scoring a deal doesn't mean refreshing airline pages for hours or gambling on shady last-minute sites. With a few clever hacks, you can seriously cut down on the cost of flights, accommodation, and everything in between. Here's what savvy travellers swear by. Also Read:Why You Need An eSIM For Your Next Trip And How It Will Change The Way You Travel  You've probably used Skyscanner, Google Flights or Kayak before. They're brilliant for comparing prices across airlines, but don't take them at face value. Always double-check prices on the airline's official website before booking. Why? Some budget airlines charge less if you book direct, especially in Europe. Plus, booking direct often comes with more flexible cancellation policies or fewer sneaky fees. Top tip: Clear your cookies or browse in incognito mode. Dynamic pricing is real-many sites hike up prices if they know you're interested. Yes, the day you book and fly does matter. According to data from Google Flights and Expedia,booking your flightson a Tuesday or Wednesday often nets the lowest fares. As for travel days? Flying on a Tuesday or Saturday tends to be cheaper than departing on Friday or Sunday, which are peak travel days. Bonus: Early-morning or red-eye flights usually cost less too. Not glamorous, but your wallet will thank you. Budget carriers like Ryanair, EasyJet, and Wizz Air offer ultra-cheap fares across Europe and beyond — but they make their money on extras. Seats, luggage, even printing your boarding pass can cost you. Hack it: Travel with just a backpack or small cabin bag (check airline dimensions carefully), and skip seat selection if you're not fussed. If you're flying with someone, book tickets separately-sometimes two singles are cheaper than booking together. If your dates are flexible, you've got way more chances to save. Use price alert features on Hopper, Skyscanner or Google Flights to get notified when prices drop. Some apps even tell you whether to book now or wait. Google Flights also has a handy calendar view showing which days are cheaper-perfect if you've got wiggle room. Compare prices on different sites or apps. Photo: iStock Chain hotels are convenient, but often not the cheapest or most characterful. Try locally-owned stays, boutique hotels or hostels with private rooms. Sites like Booking.com and Agoda offer great filters to find these gems. If you want hotel-like perks but a better deal, check out ""soft brands"" like Marriott's Autograph Collection or Hilton's Curio Collection. They're independently run hotels that still offer loyalty perks-but with more competitive pricing. Airbnb isn't always cheaper-especially after cleaning and service fees. For short stays (1-2 nights), a hotel might actually be a better deal. But for longer trips, especially with friends or family, splitting an Airbnb can save serious money. Extra win: You can cook your own meals. Even if it's just breakfast, that's a few pounds saved every day. Also Read:8 Smart Ways To Keep Track Of The Weather And Pack Like A Pro Don't sleep on cashback websites like TopCashback or Quidco. You can often get 5-10% back on bookings from Expedia, Hotels.com, Booking.com, and even some airlines. Also, sign up for airline and hotel loyalty programmes — they're free and sometimes offer instant perks like free Wi-Fi, early check-in, or extra baggage. Even if you only travel a couple of times a year, the points can add up. Flying into a smaller or alternative airport can be drastically cheaper. For example, flying into Girona instead of Barcelona, or Milan Bergamo instead of Milan Malpensa. Pair this with cheap ground transport (hello, FlixBus or regional trains) and you're golden. Just make sure you factor in the travel time and cost so it's still worth it.",2025-05-03 11:14:09,general,Positive

The Museum of East Bohemia, which took possession of the items said that the hikers had found 598 gold coins, jewellry and tobacco bags, cumulatively weighing around 15 pounds. The coins appear to have been ""hidden in the ground for over a hundred years"" and are dated from 1808 to the early 19th century. The coins are believed to have been likely buried after 1921 and include currency from France, Belgium, the Ottoman Empire and former Austria-Hungary. ""When he [one of the hikers] opened it, my jaw dropped,"" said Miroslav Novak, head of archaeology at the museum. Calling the collection a ""very specific set"", the local media reported that small marks on the currency indicate that they were minted for use in former Yugoslavia, which existed from 1918 to 1992.

Experts are now trying to determine how the treasure ended buried up on the side of the mountain. ""To store valuable objects in the ground in the form of treasures, so-called depots have been a common practice since prehistoric times. At first, religious movements were more common; later it was property stored in uncertain times with the intention of returning later for it."" One of the prevailing theories is that the treasure could have been hidden by Nazis retreating from advancing Russian forces when they were ousted at the end of World War II.  “It is difficult to say whether this is the gold of a Czech who had to leave the occupied territory after the Nazi invasion of 1938 [or] the gold of a German who feared displacement after 1945,” said museum director Petr Grulich. “It could also be stolen goods from an antique shop, but we are not inclined to this option.” While the investigation continues, the lucky hikers will get around 10 per cent of the discovery's total value, following Czech law.",2025-05-03 11:14:21,general,Positive

https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/how-uss-central-intelligence-agency-cia-is-trying-to-recruit-chinese-officials-8318081,How US's Central Intelligence Agency Is Trying To Recruit Chinese Officials,"May 03, 2025 10:13 am IST","The US's Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) has released two cinematic recruitment videos in a step aimed at deepening its intelligence reach inside China. The videos, which are just over two minutes long and are presented in Mandarin with Chinese subtitles, represent a major shift in the CIA's approach to hiring officials in China. The US views China as its main military and strategic adversary. One of the videos portrays the internal turmoil of a high-ranking Chinese Communist Party official. The video shows the official is haunted by the growing unpredictability of Chinese President Xi Jinping's sweeping anti-corruption drive. “As I rise within the party, I watch those above me being discarded like worn-out shoes, but now I realise that my fate was just as precarious as theirs,” the narrator reflects, accompanied by visuals of surveillance and hushed anxiety. The other video is about a young government employee disillusioned by the stark gap between the party's promises and the lived reality of common citizens. The protagonist toils through bureaucratic drudgery and late nights, only to return to a cramped apartment shared with his parents.  “From a young age, the party taught us that as long as we diligently followed the path laid out by our leaders, we would have a bright future,” the narrator laments. Both narratives culminate with the characters reaching out to the CIA through its secure online platform — an invitation introduced by the agency last year through a simple text video. That previous effort provided step-by-step instructions in Chinese for contacting the agency. It formed part of a broader campaign to gather intelligence from hard-to-penetrate countries like China, Iran and North Korea. Both videos can be found on YouTube and are titled in Chinese. One is called, “Why I contacted the CIA: to take control of my fate,” and the other is titled, “Why I contacted the CIA: for a better life.” Watch the videos here:  These videos reflect a more aggressive push in CIA's outreach initiatives. It shows the agency's conviction that, in spite of strict internet regulations, its messaging is effectively reaching audiences within China. “If it weren't working, we wouldn't be making more videos,”Reutersquoted a CIA official as saying. The official said that the US was not just interested in counterintelligence, but was also seeking information on advanced science, military and cyber technology, valuable economic data, and China's foreign policy secrets. China has not officially responded to the campaign.",2025-05-03 11:14:32,general,Positive

What Led To Deadly Stampede At Goa Temple","May 03, 2025 09:58 am IST","A stampede left at least six dead and dozens injured at a temple in the coastal city of Goa last night. The incident occurred during a large gathering at theShirgaon temple. The devotees were participating in an annual procession when panic spread through the crowd, causing a sudden rush. Eyewitnesses have described a chaotic scene at the temple when the tragedy struck. Lairai Jatra The Shirgaon temple was packed with devotees for the Lairai Devi jatra, the procession of Goddess Lairai and her siblings held annually during April or May. Lairai, who is believed to be an incarnation of Goddess Parvati, is among the seven sister deities in Goan folklore. The festival draws a huge number of devotees from across Goa, Maharashtra, and Karnataka. An elaborate security arrangement was made for the grand event last night in coordination with the temple committee. Over a thousand police personnel were deployed at the temple, including a Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP)-level officer. Dozens of other senior officers and hundreds of constables and women cops were part of the security structure. Several officers were in civilian clothes to prevent pickpocketing. The Goa Reserve Police Force was also on the ground. To ensure smooth traffic, over 300 traffic police personnel were deployed. The police used drone surveillance to keep an eye on the crowd. A Vajra Van, or riot control vehicle, was also on standby.  What Led To Stampede Midnight visuals showed a crowd of devotees gathered around a huge fire at the temple for a custom that involves sitting around the fire and making wishes. Devotees believe their wishes come true if they participate in this ritual. Some even walk on embers for a ritual called 'agnidivya'. But it is not known if people were taking part in the custom at the time of the stampede. Around 4-4:30 am, a sudden rush was seen among the crowd. Panic spread and chaotic scenes unfolded as devotees started jostling to escape, as described by eyewitnesses. Initial reports suggest overcrowding and a lack of crowd control measures led to the rush. Chief Minister Pramod Sawant said a sudden electric shock is said to have sparked panic in the crowd. But the exact cause is not known yet. The emergency services were put on alert. The police rushed to the stampede site and began rescue operations. At least six people, including a 17-year-old boy, lost their lives in the stampede while 50 others suffered serious injuries. The injured were taken to nearby hospitals. Authorities' Response Mr Sawant said the injured are being treated at the Goa Medical College and North Goa District Hospital. Additional teams of doctors were deployed at these two hospitals. The Chief Minister met the injured at the hospital and is monitoring the situation. Every necessary measure is being taken, he assured, adding that Prime Minister Narendra Modi has taken detailed stock of the situation. PM Modi also offered condolences and wished a speedy recovery to the injured. ""Saddened by the loss of lives due to a stampede in Shirgao, Goa. Condolences to those who lost their loved ones. May the injured recover soon. The local administration is assisting those affected,"" said the Prime Minister. A 24/7 helpline has been started; for medical emergencies, one can dial 104, informed Goa health minister Vishwajit Rane. Goa Medical College and other district hospitals are fully equipped, and 10 advanced ambulances have been deployed, he said.",2025-05-03 11:14:36,general,Positive

Questioning the security arrangements in Jammu and Kashmir after the April 22Pahalgam attack, Mr Siddaramiah had said, ""There is no necessity to wage a war against Pakistan. Strict security measures must be initiated. We are not in favour of waging war. There should be peace, people must feel secure, and the Central government should ensure effective security arrangements.""  He later issued a clarification and said that war should always be a nation's last resort. ""Only when every other means to defeat the enemy has failed, should a country be compelled to go to war... The central government has already initiated certain diplomatic steps, including revisiting the Indus Waters Treaty - a move we wholeheartedly welcome. We trust that even sterner actions are on the horizon. Not every move needs to be broadcast to the world; rest assured, the nation stands fully united behind every strong and decisive step taken,"" he said. ""At this crucial moment, nations across the world have come out in strong condemnation of Pakistan-sponsored terrorism, standing firmly with India. We must seize this unprecedented global support and teach Pakistan a lesson so profound that they dare not commit such reckless acts ever again,"" he added. Mr Siddaramaiah's remarks were covered by Pakistani media, prompting the BJP to launch a scathing attack on the Congress veteran. Therelations between India and Pakistanhave soured after the terror attack in Pahalgam left 26 people dead. India, citing ""cross-border linkages"" to the attack, has announced a raft of punitive measures against Pakistan, including suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty, shutting down of the only operational land border crossing at Attari and downgrading of diplomatic ties.

The meeting is aimed at building a unified political stance on the state's long-standing contention with Punjab regarding water allocation from the Bhakra system. The ongoing row was triggered by the Bhakra Beas Management Board's (BBMB) decision to release 8,500 cusecs of water from the reservoir to Haryana, which is an additional 4,500 cusecs. The Haryana government, led by the BJP, seeks to formulate a comprehensive strategy to assert its rights over water distribution. Political leaders across party lines have been invited to participate in the meeting. Representatives from the ruling BJP, Congress, Indian National Lok Dal (INLD), Jannayak Janata Party (JJP), Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), and the Communist Party of India (Marxist) have all confirmed attendance.  Notable leaders slated to attend include BJP's Mohan Lal Badoli, Congress state president Udai Bhan, INLD's Ram Pal Majra, JJP leader Dushyant Chautala, AAP's Sushil Gupta, Krishan Jamalpur of BSP, and CPI(M)'s Prem Chand. The National People's Party, though headquartered in Shillong, has also been invited to join the dialogue. The move comes shortly after Punjab held a similar all-party consultation on the issue on Friday. The all-party meeting, chaired by Punjab Chief Minister Bhagwant Mann on Friday to discuss the issue of giving additional water to neighbouring Haryana, unanimously decided that the state itself has no surplus water. They also decided to meet either Prime Minister Narendra Modi or Union Home Minister Amit Shah, to apprise them of the situation. The meeting comprised leaders from the AAP, BJP, the Congress and the Shiromani Akali Dal. Later there was a media interaction after the all-party meeting of all prominent parties expressed unanimity with the AAP government's refusal to share extra water with Haryana. Chief Minister Mann told the media that all the political parties, rising above their ideology, suggested to the government that it must save every drop of the water which is the state's lifeline. Chief Minister Mann said Haryana, which is already receiving 4,700 cusecs against its allocated 1,700 cusecs, is now set to benefit from additional 'theft' of Punjab's rightful share. Chief Minister Mann clarified that Haryana has already used 103 per cent of its share and warned of agitation ""if Punjab's rights are denied"". He said the government of Punjab has convened a special Assembly session on sharing water on May 5. Similarly, addressing the media in Panchkula on Friday, Chief Minister Saini criticised Punjab's AAP-led government for allegedly politicising the water crisis, stating that Haryana has a legal and moral claim to its rightful share. The chief minister emphasised that the issue transcends party lines and requires a united front to safeguard Haryana's interests. Interestingly, the water dispute has created a peculiar political scenario, with national parties such as the BJP, Congress, and AAP facing internal contradictions. While their Haryana units are pushing for rightful water allocation, their Punjab counterparts maintain there is no surplus water to share and Haryana has already got its share of the water. The latest stand-off began on April 23, when Haryana sought 8,500 cusecs of water from the Bhakra-Nangal project, 4,500 cusecs more than what it is currently receiving. Punjab Chief Minister Mann refused, putting the ball in the court of the BBMB.

""Every time I ask a question, at the end it asks another little question to see if it can get yet another question out of me."" As per Mr Systrom, the chatbots being too engaging was not a bug but instead an intentional feature, inserted by AI companies to inflate metrics such as time spent and daily active users. He added that companies should be ""laser-focused"" on providing high-quality answers rather than moving the metrics.

Police sources stated that the department is likely to formalise the arrests and make an official announcement later on Saturday. The police had formed five special teams to apprehend the killers. All the accused are being interrogated, and they were arrested from various locations within Mangaluru district. Investigators have obtained video footage of the incident, which helped in identifying and apprehending the suspects, sources said. However, Leader of the Opposition (LoP), R Ashoka, alleged that a week before the murder, Suhas Shetty was warned by police not to carry weapons in his vehicle, and his vehicle was searched. ""How did this message reach the killers? If he had a weapon, he might have survived. The murder took place within half a kilometre of a police presence, yet no officer rushed to the spot,"" Mr Ashoka stated. ""A week before, the killers had put up a message saying Suhas Shetty will be finished. After the murder they had put up another message celebrating the murder,"" he said. Union Minister of State Shobha Karandlaje and Mangaluru BJP MP Captain Brijesh Chowta have appealed to Union Home Minister Amit Shah to transfer the case to the National Investigation Agency (NIA).  BJP State President BY Vijayendra has announced a compensation of Rs 25 lakh for Suhas Shetty's family. BJP MLC CT Ravi and other party leaders warned that if police fail to act, revenge killings will continue in Mangaluru. ""There is no one who has the mindset to let Suhas' murderers go free,"" Mr Ravi said. Multiple stabbing incidents have been reported from the Mangaluru and Udupi districts in the coastal Karnataka region following Shetty's murder, and the situation remains tense and volatile. Karnataka Home Minister G Parameshwara is visiting Mangaluru on Saturday to assess the situation and review the law and order situation. He is expected to hold a meeting with senior officers at the Mangaluru Police Commissionerate. According to the investigation, the accused first rammed a goods vehicle into the car in which Suhas Shetty was travelling. Then, a gang of assailants, who were following in a Swift car, emerged with weapons and brutally hacked him to death. LoP R Ashoka alleged that members of the banned Popular Front of India (PFI) and the Karnataka Forum for Dignity were responsible for Shetty's murder. Suhas Shetty was a Bajrang Dal activist and the prime accused in the murder of Mohammad Fazil, a resident of Surathkal. Shetty and his associates allegedly killed Fazil in a public place on July 28, 2022, in retaliation for the murder of BJP youth worker Praveen Kumar Nettaru. Nettaru, a BJP activist from the same communally sensitive region, was hacked to death during the height of the 'hijab' row. His murder had triggered a series of revenge killings and multiple stabbing incidents across Karnataka. Mangaluru also recently witnessed the mob lynching of a man from Kerala, identified as Mohammad Ashraf, who was allegedly heard shouting ""Pakistan Zindabad"" during a cricket tournament. Police are currently investigating whether there is any connection between the murder of Suhas Shetty and the recent lynching incident.

Mr Patra coined an analogy, saying, ""On the outside, it may be the Congress Working Committee (CWC), but on the inside, it's a Pakistan Working Committee (PWC)."" Mr Patra criticised Congress MP and former Punjab Chief Minister Charanjit Singh Channi for questioning the authenticity of the 2019 Indian Armed Force surgical strike carried out in response to the Pulwama terror attack. ""The Congress Party, after its Working Committee meeting, held a separate press conference strategically led by Channi, who cast doubt on the very existence of the surgical strikes. This isn't just irresponsible, it's dangerous,"" Mr Patra said. Highlighting a recent terrorist attack at Pahalgam in Jammu and Kashmir, Mr Patra questioned the Congress' seriousness towards national security. ""Even if the Congress party does not take terrorist attacks seriously, even if the sentiments of the people of the country are disregarded by the Congress party, Rahul Gandhi, former party President Sonia Gandhi and the Gandhi family, but they do not have the liberty to repeatedly demoralise the nation's armed forces or to play with the sentiments of the people,"" he added. Further escalating his attack, Mr Patra referenced recent statements from Pakistan's Parliament, where a PTI senator, Saifullah Abro, praised Indian Opposition parties like the Aam Aadmi Party and Samajwadi Party for criticising Prime Minister Modi rather than condemning terrorism.  ""In Pakistan's Parliament, PTI Senator Saifullah Abro stated that the entire Indian Opposition is condemning the Pahalgam attack whether it is Delhi's Aam Aadmi Party or Uttar Pradesh's Samajwadi Party. No one is supporting Modi; everyone is opposing him. They are saying that Modi has always been against Muslims and now he won't get any cover. In Pakistan's Parliament, there is praise for Akhilesh Yadav and Arvind Kejriwal,"" he said. ""So Rahul Gandhi thought, why stay behind? That's why he pushed Charanjit Singh Channi to hold a press conference which is now also being praised in Pakistan,"" Mr Patra claimed. He said that the Congress Party's actions amount to providing ""oxygen"" to Pakistan-sponsored terrorism. ""This isn't just political posturing; it's a betrayal of national interest. The Congress must answer why it continues to speak Pakistan's language on Indian soil,"" Mr Patra said.

There's little doubt over the outcome of the ballot that will likely name a senior SpaceX representative as mayor of the new settlement. Most of the 283 eligible voters are SpaceX employees working at the site on Boca Chica Bay bordering Mexico, or have connections to the company whose billionaire chief has long eyed a human mission to Mars. Most ballots have already been cast ahead of the 7:00 pm (0100 GMT) deadline on Saturday. Musk himself is registered to vote, Cameron County Election Coordinator Remi Garza told AFP, but the South African-born embattled 53-year-old had yet to cast his ballot when the early voting period closed on April 29.  Nearly 500 people live around the base in Cameron County, on land mostly owned by SpaceX or its employees, official documents show. The change would allow Starbase to control building and permitting and avoid other regulatory hurdles, while collecting taxes and writing local law. The vote comes at a difficult time for Musk, who is expected to reduce his role as the unofficial head of US President Donald Trump's cost-cutting ""Department of Government Efficiency"" to instead focus more on his troubled car company, Tesla. The vote on Saturday includes a mayoral election, but Bobby Peden, vice president of testing and launch at SpaceX, according to LinkedIn, is the only candidate on the ballot for this position. The Texas base launched in 2019 and is a key testing site for the company's rocket launches. Not everyone is upbeat about the prospect of a SpaceX town. Bekah Hinojosa, co-founder of the South Texas Environmental Justice Network, voiced concerns over the environmental impact, warning of ""more environmental destruction."" ""They would attempt more illegal dumping, they would build up their dangerous rocket operations and cause more seismic activity, cause our homes to shake, and that they would destroy more of the wildlife habitat in the region,"" she told AFP. - Environmental concerns - It was Musk himself who proposed the name Starbase in a social media post during a visit to the site four years ago. Then, last December, general manager of SpaceX Kathryn Lueders appealed to local authorities to grant the site city status. Lueders argued in her letter that SpaceX already maintained infrastructure there like roads, education services and medical care. Lueders promised the creation of the new city would not undermine SpaceX efforts to mitigate the base's environmental impact. SpaceX did not respond to an AFP request for comment. The hub overlooks the Gulf of Mexico -- renamed the Gulf of America by Trump -- and there is controversy over access to Boca Chica Beach. A Texas House State Affairs committee rejected a bill this week by Republican lawmakers that would have given coastal cities with spaceports control over beach access. Hinojosa, the activist, said SpaceX has limited access to Boca Chica Beach for many years and told AFP she worried the vote could cut access entirely to a beach ""our families have been going to for generations."" The Carrizo/Comecrudo Nation of Texas, descendants of an Indigenous tribe in the area, has also complained. In 2024, the Environmental Protection Agency and Texas authorities found that SpaceX was responsible for repeated spills and releasing pollutants into Texas waterways. In response to reports that its rockets had caused damage to wild bird nests, Musk quipped on social media: ""To make up for this heinous crime, I will refrain from having omelette for a week.""

For 18 years, starting in 2001, California-based Tim Friede got himself knowingly bitten by some of the most venomous snakes on the planet in hopes of finding a cure for all snake bites. According to a report inCNN, antibodies found in Mr Friede's blood have now been shown to protect against fatal doses from a wide range of species in animal tests. Immunologist Jacob Glanville first heard about Mr Friede through media reports in 2017 and decided that there was an opportunity to do something groundbreaking. ""We had this conversation. And I said, I know it's awkward, but I'm really interested in looking at some of your blood,"" said Mr Glanville. ""And he [Tim Friede] said, 'Finally, I've been waiting for this call.'"" As the pair began working together, Mr Friede donated a 40-millilitre blood sample to Mr Glanville and his colleagues. Eight years later, Mr Glanville and Peter Kwong, Richard J. Stock, Professor of medical sciences at Columbia University's Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons havepublisheddetails of the antivenom that can protect against the bites from 19 species of poisonous snakes.  Currently, antivenom is made by injecting small doses of snake venom into animals, such as horses. Once the immune system fights the venom and produces the antibodies, scientists harvest them to be used as antivenom. However, venom and antivenom have to be closely matched. For example, antivenom made from snakes in India may not be as effective against the same species in Thailand. Also Read | Coldest Exoplanet Orbiting A Dead Star Found By Scientists While the antivenom cocktail prepared using MrFriede's blood has not been tested in humans yet, experts predict that the human origin of the antibodies would mean fewer side effects than antivenoms made the traditional way. ""Tim's antibodies are really quite extraordinary - he taught his immune system to get this very, very broad recognition,"" said Prof Kwong. Notably, Mr Friede gave up on injecting himself with snake venom in 2018 after some close calls. He is now employed by Glanville's biotechnology company Centivax and contributing to the research. As per the World Health Organization (WHO), every year, venomous snake bites kill tens of thousands of people globally and permanently disable several hundred thousand more.",2025-05-03 13:26:31,general,Positive

Questioning the security arrangements in Jammu and Kashmir after the April 22Pahalgam attack, Mr Siddaramiah had said, ""There is no necessity to wage a war against Pakistan. Strict security measures must be initiated. We are not in favour of waging war. There should be peace, people must feel secure, and the Central government should ensure effective security arrangements.""  He later issued a clarification and said that war should always be a nation's last resort. ""Only when every other means to defeat the enemy has failed, should a country be compelled to go to war... The central government has already initiated certain diplomatic steps, including revisiting the Indus Waters Treaty - a move we wholeheartedly welcome. We trust that even sterner actions are on the horizon. Not every move needs to be broadcast to the world; rest assured, the nation stands fully united behind every strong and decisive step taken,"" he said. ""At this crucial moment, nations across the world have come out in strong condemnation of Pakistan-sponsored terrorism, standing firmly with India. We must seize this unprecedented global support and teach Pakistan a lesson so profound that they dare not commit such reckless acts ever again,"" he added. Mr Siddaramaiah's remarks were covered by Pakistani media, prompting the BJP to launch a scathing attack on the Congress veteran. Therelations between India and Pakistanhave soured after the terror attack in Pahalgam left 26 people dead. India, citing ""cross-border linkages"" to the attack, has announced a raft of punitive measures against Pakistan, including suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty, shutting down of the only operational land border crossing at Attari and downgrading of diplomatic ties.

The meeting is aimed at building a unified political stance on the state's long-standing contention with Punjab regarding water allocation from the Bhakra system. The ongoing row was triggered by the Bhakra Beas Management Board's (BBMB) decision to release 8,500 cusecs of water from the reservoir to Haryana, which is an additional 4,500 cusecs. The Haryana government, led by the BJP, seeks to formulate a comprehensive strategy to assert its rights over water distribution. Political leaders across party lines have been invited to participate in the meeting. Representatives from the ruling BJP, Congress, Indian National Lok Dal (INLD), Jannayak Janata Party (JJP), Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), and the Communist Party of India (Marxist) have all confirmed attendance.  Notable leaders slated to attend include BJP's Mohan Lal Badoli, Congress state president Udai Bhan, INLD's Ram Pal Majra, JJP leader Dushyant Chautala, AAP's Sushil Gupta, Krishan Jamalpur of BSP, and CPI(M)'s Prem Chand. The National People's Party, though headquartered in Shillong, has also been invited to join the dialogue. The move comes shortly after Punjab held a similar all-party consultation on the issue on Friday. The all-party meeting, chaired by Punjab Chief Minister Bhagwant Mann on Friday to discuss the issue of giving additional water to neighbouring Haryana, unanimously decided that the state itself has no surplus water. They also decided to meet either Prime Minister Narendra Modi or Union Home Minister Amit Shah, to apprise them of the situation. The meeting comprised leaders from the AAP, BJP, the Congress and the Shiromani Akali Dal. Later there was a media interaction after the all-party meeting of all prominent parties expressed unanimity with the AAP government's refusal to share extra water with Haryana. Chief Minister Mann told the media that all the political parties, rising above their ideology, suggested to the government that it must save every drop of the water which is the state's lifeline. Chief Minister Mann said Haryana, which is already receiving 4,700 cusecs against its allocated 1,700 cusecs, is now set to benefit from additional 'theft' of Punjab's rightful share. Chief Minister Mann clarified that Haryana has already used 103 per cent of its share and warned of agitation ""if Punjab's rights are denied"". He said the government of Punjab has convened a special Assembly session on sharing water on May 5. Similarly, addressing the media in Panchkula on Friday, Chief Minister Saini criticised Punjab's AAP-led government for allegedly politicising the water crisis, stating that Haryana has a legal and moral claim to its rightful share. The chief minister emphasised that the issue transcends party lines and requires a united front to safeguard Haryana's interests. Interestingly, the water dispute has created a peculiar political scenario, with national parties such as the BJP, Congress, and AAP facing internal contradictions. While their Haryana units are pushing for rightful water allocation, their Punjab counterparts maintain there is no surplus water to share and Haryana has already got its share of the water. The latest stand-off began on April 23, when Haryana sought 8,500 cusecs of water from the Bhakra-Nangal project, 4,500 cusecs more than what it is currently receiving. Punjab Chief Minister Mann refused, putting the ball in the court of the BBMB.

""Every time I ask a question, at the end it asks another little question to see if it can get yet another question out of me.""

https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/8-suspects-arrested-in-killing-of-murder-accused-in-mangaluru-8318870,8 Arrested In Killing Of Murder-Accused Suhas Shetty In Mangaluru,"May 03, 2025 13:25 pm IST","Karnataka Police have arrested eight suspects in connection with the murder of Hindu activist Suhas Shetty, which was reported from the communally-sensitive city of Mangaluru, officials said on Saturday. Police sources stated that the department is likely to formalise the arrests and make an official announcement later on Saturday. The police had formed five special teams to apprehend the killers. All the accused are being interrogated, and they were arrested from various locations within Mangaluru district. Investigators have obtained video footage of the incident, which helped in identifying and apprehending the suspects, sources said. However, Leader of the Opposition (LoP), R Ashoka, alleged that a week before the murder, Suhas Shetty was warned by police not to carry weapons in his vehicle, and his vehicle was searched. ""How did this message reach the killers? If he had a weapon, he might have survived. The murder took place within half a kilometre of a police presence, yet no officer rushed to the spot,"" Mr Ashoka stated. ""A week before, the killers had put up a message saying Suhas Shetty will be finished. After the murder they had put up another message celebrating the murder,"" he said. Union Minister of State Shobha Karandlaje and Mangaluru BJP MP Captain Brijesh Chowta have appealed to Union Home Minister Amit Shah to transfer the case to the National Investigation Agency (NIA).  BJP State President BY Vijayendra has announced a compensation of Rs 25 lakh for Suhas Shetty's family. BJP MLC CT Ravi and other party leaders warned that if police fail to act, revenge killings will continue in Mangaluru. ""There is no one who has the mindset to let Suhas' murderers go free,"" Mr Ravi said. Multiple stabbing incidents have been reported from the Mangaluru and Udupi districts in the coastal Karnataka region following Shetty's murder, and the situation remains tense and volatile. Karnataka Home Minister G Parameshwara is visiting Mangaluru on Saturday to assess the situation and review the law and order situation. He is expected to hold a meeting with senior officers at the Mangaluru Police Commissionerate. According to the investigation, the accused first rammed a goods vehicle into the car in which Suhas Shetty was travelling. Then, a gang of assailants, who were following in a Swift car, emerged with weapons and brutally hacked him to death. LoP R Ashoka alleged that members of the banned Popular Front of India (PFI) and the Karnataka Forum for Dignity were responsible for Shetty's murder. Suhas Shetty was a Bajrang Dal activist and the prime accused in the murder of Mohammad Fazil, a resident of Surathkal. Shetty and his associates allegedly killed Fazil in a public place on July 28, 2022, in retaliation for the murder of BJP youth worker Praveen Kumar Nettaru. Nettaru, a BJP activist from the same communally sensitive region, was hacked to death during the height of the 'hijab' row. His murder had triggered a series of revenge killings and multiple stabbing incidents across Karnataka. Mangaluru also recently witnessed the mob lynching of a man from Kerala, identified as Mohammad Ashraf, who was allegedly heard shouting ""Pakistan Zindabad"" during a cricket tournament. Police are currently investigating whether there is any connection between the murder of Suhas Shetty and the recent lynching incident.

Mr Patra coined an analogy, saying, ""On the outside, it may be the Congress Working Committee (CWC), but on the inside, it's a Pakistan Working Committee (PWC)."" Mr Patra criticised Congress MP and former Punjab Chief Minister Charanjit Singh Channi for questioning the authenticity of the 2019 Indian Armed Force surgical strike carried out in response to the Pulwama terror attack. ""The Congress Party, after its Working Committee meeting, held a separate press conference strategically led by Channi, who cast doubt on the very existence of the surgical strikes. This isn't just irresponsible, it's dangerous,"" Mr Patra said. Highlighting a recent terrorist attack at Pahalgam in Jammu and Kashmir, Mr Patra questioned the Congress' seriousness towards national security. ""Even if the Congress party does not take terrorist attacks seriously, even if the sentiments of the people of the country are disregarded by the Congress party, Rahul Gandhi, former party President Sonia Gandhi and the Gandhi family, but they do not have the liberty to repeatedly demoralise the nation's armed forces or to play with the sentiments of the people,"" he added. Further escalating his attack, Mr Patra referenced recent statements from Pakistan's Parliament, where a PTI senator, Saifullah Abro, praised Indian Opposition parties like the Aam Aadmi Party and Samajwadi Party for criticising Prime Minister Modi rather than condemning terrorism.  ""In Pakistan's Parliament, PTI Senator Saifullah Abro stated that the entire Indian Opposition is condemning the Pahalgam attack whether it is Delhi's Aam Aadmi Party or Uttar Pradesh's Samajwadi Party. No one is supporting Modi; everyone is opposing him. They are saying that Modi has always been against Muslims and now he won't get any cover. In Pakistan's Parliament, there is praise for Akhilesh Yadav and Arvind Kejriwal,"" he said. ""So Rahul Gandhi thought, why stay behind? That's why he pushed Charanjit Singh Channi to hold a press conference which is now also being praised in Pakistan,"" Mr Patra claimed. He said that the Congress Party's actions amount to providing ""oxygen"" to Pakistan-sponsored terrorism. ""This isn't just political posturing; it's a betrayal of national interest. The Congress must answer why it continues to speak Pakistan's language on Indian soil,"" Mr Patra said.

There's little doubt over the outcome of the ballot that will likely name a senior SpaceX representative as mayor of the new settlement. Most of the 283 eligible voters are SpaceX employees working at the site on Boca Chica Bay bordering Mexico, or have connections to the company whose billionaire chief has long eyed a human mission to Mars. Most ballots have already been cast ahead of the 7:00 pm (0100 GMT) deadline on Saturday. Musk himself is registered to vote, Cameron County Election Coordinator Remi Garza told AFP, but the South African-born embattled 53-year-old had yet to cast his ballot when the early voting period closed on April 29.  Nearly 500 people live around the base in Cameron County, on land mostly owned by SpaceX or its employees, official documents show. The change would allow Starbase to control building and permitting and avoid other regulatory hurdles, while collecting taxes and writing local law. The vote comes at a difficult time for Musk, who is expected to reduce his role as the unofficial head of US President Donald Trump's cost-cutting ""Department of Government Efficiency"" to instead focus more on his troubled car company, Tesla. The vote on Saturday includes a mayoral election, but Bobby Peden, vice president of testing and launch at SpaceX, according to LinkedIn, is the only candidate on the ballot for this position. The Texas base launched in 2019 and is a key testing site for the company's rocket launches. Not everyone is upbeat about the prospect of a SpaceX town. Bekah Hinojosa, co-founder of the South Texas Environmental Justice Network, voiced concerns over the environmental impact, warning of ""more environmental destruction."" ""They would attempt more illegal dumping, they would build up their dangerous rocket operations and cause more seismic activity, cause our homes to shake, and that they would destroy more of the wildlife habitat in the region,"" she told AFP. - Environmental concerns - It was Musk himself who proposed the name Starbase in a social media post during a visit to the site four years ago. Then, last December, general manager of SpaceX Kathryn Lueders appealed to local authorities to grant the site city status. Lueders argued in her letter that SpaceX already maintained infrastructure there like roads, education services and medical care. Lueders promised the creation of the new city would not undermine SpaceX efforts to mitigate the base's environmental impact. SpaceX did not respond to an AFP request for comment. The hub overlooks the Gulf of Mexico -- renamed the Gulf of America by Trump -- and there is controversy over access to Boca Chica Beach. A Texas House State Affairs committee rejected a bill this week by Republican lawmakers that would have given coastal cities with spaceports control over beach access. Hinojosa, the activist, said SpaceX has limited access to Boca Chica Beach for many years and told AFP she worried the vote could cut access entirely to a beach ""our families have been going to for generations."" The Carrizo/Comecrudo Nation of Texas, descendants of an Indigenous tribe in the area, has also complained. In 2024, the Environmental Protection Agency and Texas authorities found that SpaceX was responsible for repeated spills and releasing pollutants into Texas waterways. In response to reports that its rockets had caused damage to wild bird nests, Musk quipped on social media: ""To make up for this heinous crime, I will refrain from having omelette for a week.""

For 18 years, starting in 2001, California-based Tim Friede got himself knowingly bitten by some of the most venomous snakes on the planet in hopes of finding a cure for all snake bites. According to a report inCNN, antibodies found in Mr Friede's blood have now been shown to protect against fatal doses from a wide range of species in animal tests. Immunologist Jacob Glanville first heard about Mr Friede through media reports in 2017 and decided that there was an opportunity to do something groundbreaking. ""We had this conversation. And I said, I know it's awkward, but I'm really interested in looking at some of your blood,"" said Mr Glanville. ""And he [Tim Friede] said, 'Finally, I've been waiting for this call.'"" As the pair began working together, Mr Friede donated a 40-millilitre blood sample to Mr Glanville and his colleagues. Eight years later, Mr Glanville and Peter Kwong, Richard J. Stock, Professor of medical sciences at Columbia University's Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons havepublisheddetails of the antivenom that can protect against the bites from 19 species of poisonous snakes.  Currently, antivenom is made by injecting small doses of snake venom into animals, such as horses. Once the immune system fights the venom and produces the antibodies, scientists harvest them to be used as antivenom. However, venom and antivenom have to be closely matched. For example, antivenom made from snakes in India may not be as effective against the same species in Thailand. Also Read | Coldest Exoplanet Orbiting A Dead Star Found By Scientists While the antivenom cocktail prepared using MrFriede's blood has not been tested in humans yet, experts predict that the human origin of the antibodies would mean fewer side effects than antivenoms made the traditional way. ""Tim's antibodies are really quite extraordinary - he taught his immune system to get this very, very broad recognition,"" said Prof Kwong. Notably, Mr Friede gave up on injecting himself with snake venom in 2018 after some close calls. He is now employed by Glanville's biotechnology company Centivax and contributing to the research. As per the World Health Organization (WHO), every year, venomous snake bites kill tens of thousands of people globally and permanently disable several hundred thousand more.",2025-05-03 13:27:21,general,Positive

Farhan was immediately transported to Hamidia Hospital, Bhopal, for treatment. Meanwhile, police authorities have initiated proceedings against him for attempted murder. On Friday, the Ashoka Garden Police Station secured Farhan's remand for further investigation.

It's a simple grilled sausage wrapped in a slice of white bread and topped with onions and ketchup, however, when the same is offered at polling places on election day, it becomes a 'democracy sausage' that has become a national symbol for participating in elections, and is served everywhere Australians vote.Not just in Australia, but these democracy sausages are also served at polling places for citizens abroad at Australian embassies in New York, Riyadh, Nairobi and Tokyo, and even at a research station in Antarctica. There is a website that also tracks in real-time crowd-sourced democracy sausage locations on polling day: ""It's practically part of the Australian Constitution."" The spokesperson of the website democracysausage.org, added, ""We've heard reports of people who are tourists over here, foreign students, that will go along to election days just to get the sausages. I think that's a great piece of Australian culture for people to take home with them.""  The sausage is also a way for aspiring leaders to show that they are humble enough to eat a cheap piece of meat wrapped in bread, and photographs of politicians eating these democracy sausages have become memes, and generally a part of Australian political folklore. The Australian National Dictionary Centre also named ""democracy sausage"" as its word of the year. Moreover, the Australian constitution does not mention anything about a dress code for voting, and it has become a tradition to vote in swimwear. This started when the maker of ""Budgie Smuggler"" was giving out free swimming trunks to the first 200 people who voted in smugglers. ""It's a little bit revealing and may be confronting for some of your viewers. But a lot people here come out of the water and come and vote. I think it's a nice statement of Australian democracy"", Nick Fabbri, a voter in the Bondi area of Sydney, told Reuters. Voting in Australia for the national election began on Saturday. Per polls, voter appetite for change has been dampened by US tariffs, and hence the elections might favour Labour Prime Minister Anthony Albanese over conservative challenger Peter Dutton.",2025-05-03 14:24:28,general,Positive

The faux Mount Fuji, dubbed the Universe Fantasy Land, is situated in the Hebei province of northern China, with visitors being charged Rs 1,138 (98 yuan) for each visit. According to a report inSouth China Morning Post, the tourist spot went viral on Chinese social media platforms after users posted videos and photos of the hill. The authorities responsible for the site sold it to prospective visitors as a fairy tale landscape, featuring a mountain, a lake, lush green grass, a white horse and a charming wooden cottage. The fantasy land was meant to be a getaway for urban dwellers from the capital city of Beijing who were eager to escape the mundane reality of life. One of the promotional videos of the location showed tourists nestled up in a nearby building as artificial pink smoke released from the hill -- designed as an ""eruption"" from the volcano hill. While many visitors were drawn by the clever promo material, they could not help but feel scammed as the mountain advertised turned out to be nothing more than a modest hilltop, painted white.  ""Just a small hill with white paint on its top. It has nothing to do with Mount Fuji,"" one visitor said, while another added: ""Just another instance of how modern individuals are misled by glamorous photographs."" A third commented: ""You do not need to pay to capture photos with the real Mount Fuji, yet here you have to pay for the fake one."" This is not the first instance when the Hebei province has gained headlines for its depiction of monuments and tourist attractions. Previously, the Eiffel Tower, the Great Sphinx of Giza, and even sections of the Great Wall have been replicated in the province, much to the amusement of the tourists.

However, he became the subject of a second search only four days later when he decided to recover his belongings that he had left behind, including his phone.

On his YouTube channel ""Naa Anveshana"", Visakhapatnam-based Anvesh had posted a video in which he claimed DGP Jitender and the IAS officers accepted the amount to allow betting apps. He also accused the officials of misappropriating funds through the app, adding that the officials allowed promotion of the betting apps through advertisements on the Hyderabad Metro Rail. The other officials he named included Hyderabad Metro Rail Managing Director NVS Reddy, IAS officers Santhi Kumar, Dana Kishor and Vikas Raj. A First Information Report (FIR) against Anvesh was registered on a complaint by A Naveen Kumar, a constable working in the social media cell of Cyberabad Police Commissionerate. The police have called allegations baseless and have initiated legal action against him for disseminating unverified information.  Anvesh, who has 2.4 million subscribers on YouTube and 2 million followers on Instagram, had claimed that transactions worth Rs 1,000 crore occurred through betting apps, naming several Tollywood actors and social media influencers who were promoting and profiting from the business. Hyderabad Metro Rail Limited (HMRL) had last week removed advertisements related to betting apps from all metro premises after a Telangana High Court notice in response to a plea.

Iran-backed Houthi rebels have claimed responsibility for the attack, saying it demonstrated their ability to strike sensitive targets in Israel. The missile struck near Israel's biggest airport after multiple interception attempts by the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) failed, prompting a temporary halt in all takeoffs and landings at the country's main international airport. Around an hour after the strike, the Israel Airport Authority said the airspace was reopened and flight operations resumed. Local media said though a direct hit on terminal infrastructure was averted, the missile impacted a grove adjacent to an access road within the airport's perimeter. Following the strike, Israel's Defence Minister, Israel Katz, in a terse statement, said, ""Whoever harms us, we will strike them sevenfold.""  So far, Israel has refrained from launching retaliatory strikes on Yemen despite a series of Houthi attacks, as the United States leads a broader military campaign against the Iran-backed group. Meanwhile, Mohammed al-Bukhaiti, a senior official in Yemen's Houthi rebel movement, told the Qatari Al-Araby TV channel that the attack demonstrated their ability to strike sensitive targets in Israel and that the Iran-backed group has ""no red lines"" in its fight against Israel. Nasser al-Din Omar, media head for the Houthis, also reportedly warned the airlines against operations in Israel, saying it endangers the safety of their aircraft. Palestinian group Hamas also praised the 'precision' strike by Yemen's Huthis on the Israeli airport. Israel Probing Incident The Israeli Air Force's aerial defence units are now probing the reasons behind the unsuccessful interceptions of the missile fired by Houthis that breached Israel's air defence near one of the country's most sensitive zones. Magen David Adom (MDA), Israel's national emergency service, reported that eight people were injured in the attack. The Iran-backed Huthi rebels, who control swathes of Yemen, have launched missiles and drones targeting Israel and Red Sea shipping throughout the Gaza war, saying they are acting in solidarity with Palestinians. On Saturday, the Huthis claimed a third missile attack on Israel in two days. The vast majority of missiles fired by the Huthis since the start of the Gaza war in 2023 have been intercepted by Israeli air defences. The Yemeni rebels had paused their attacks during a recent two-month ceasefire in the Gaza war. But in March, they threatened to resume attacks on international shipping over Israel's aid blockade on the Gaza Strip. The move triggered a response from the US military, which began hammering the rebels with near-daily air strikes starting March 15 in a bid to keep them from threatening shipping in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden. US strikes on the rebels began under former president Joe Biden, but intensified under his successor Donald Trump. Since March, the United States says it has struck more than 1,000 targets in Yemen.",2025-05-04 17:02:19,general,Positive

The newly observed object, named 2024 PT5, was spotted near Earth last August and is thought to be a lunar fragment, possibly blasted off the Moon during a massive impact long ago. This makes it only the second known piece of the Moon found orbiting in near-Earth space. ""If there were only one object, that would be interesting but an outlier,"" said Teddy Kareta, a planetary scientist at Lowell Observatory in Arizona. ""If there's two, we're pretty confident that's a population."" The findings were published inThe Astrophysical Journal Lettersin January and presented in March at the 56th Lunar and Planetary Sciences Conference in Texas. 2024 PT5 stood out when it was first observed by astronomers in South Africa, thanks to its unusually slow movement, just 2 metres per second relative to Earth. That made it a promising candidate for the Mission Accessible Near-Earth Object Survey (MANOS), which focuses on finding asteroids that are easiest to reach with spacecraft.  The rock, just 26 to 39 feet (8 to 12 metres) wide, didn't look like a typical asteroid. Mr Kareta and his team believe it may have been ejected from the Moon's surface during a violent impact. The discovery suggests that other such fragments might be hiding in near-Earth space. Earth regularly travels through a cloud of debris, both natural and man-made, as it orbits the Sun. Some of it is leftover rock from the early solar system, and scientists keep a close eye on these near-Earth objects (NEOs) in case any pose a threat. Material that gets blasted off the Moon during an impact usually stays close to Earth's orbit, especially the slower pieces. 2024 PT5 was briefly called a minimoon in September because it moved alongside Earth for a short time. But it didn't stay for long and eventually drifted away. Scientists think it will come close to Earth again in 2055. Within a week of the discovery, Mr Kareta and MANOS principal investigator Nick Moskovitz turned the Lowell Discovery Telescope toward 2024 PT5. After analysing the rock in visible and near-infrared light, they found its composition closely resembled moon rocks brought back by the Apollo missions and the Soviet Luna 24 mission. ""It's like realising a crime scene has a totally new kind of evidence you didn't know you had before,"" Mr Kareta toldSpace.com. ""It might not help you solve the crime right away, but considering the importance of the task, new details to compare are always welcome."" This is only the second known lunar fragment spotted in near-Earth space. The first, called Kamo'oalewa, was discovered in 2016 and linked to the Moon in 2021.",2025-05-04 17:02:27,general,Positive

The missile reportedly bypassed four layers of air defence and hit a grove adjacent to an access road within the airport's perimeter--one of the country's most sensitive zones-- creating a 25-meter deep crater. Israel Defence Forces (IDF) said their several attempts to intercept the missile failed before it landed near the airport, sending a plume of smoke into the air. However, a direct hit on terminal infrastructure was averted, yet it caused panic among passengers in the terminal building. At least eight people were injured in the attack, Magen David Adom (MDA), Israel's national emergency service, said.

This year, Google is also celebrating the day by throwing confetti around the search page when a user types the term ""Star Wars"" or ""May the fourth be with you"".

Fans dress up as their favourite characters and get together to celebrate the movie franchise.

The missile struck near Israel's biggest airport after multiple interception attempts by the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) failed, prompting a temporary halt in all takeoffs and landings at the country's main international airport. Around an hour after the strike, the Israel Airport Authority said the airspace was reopened and flight operations resumed. Local media said though a direct hit on terminal infrastructure was averted, the missile impacted a grove adjacent to an access road within the airport's perimeter.

Magen David Adom (MDA), Israel's national emergency service, reported that eight people were injured in the attack. The Iran-backed Huthi rebels, who control swathes of Yemen, have launched missiles and drones targeting Israel and Red Sea shipping throughout the Gaza war, saying they are acting in solidarity with Palestinians. On Saturday, the Huthis claimed a third missile attack on Israel in two days. The vast majority of missiles fired by the Huthis since the start of the Gaza war in 2023 have been intercepted by Israeli air defences. The Yemeni rebels had paused their attacks during a recent two-month ceasefire in the Gaza war. But in March, they threatened to resume attacks on international shipping over Israel's aid blockade on the Gaza Strip. The move triggered a response from the US military, which began hammering the rebels with near-daily air strikes starting March 15 in a bid to keep them from threatening shipping in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden. US strikes on the rebels began under former president Joe Biden, but intensified under his successor Donald Trump.

The newly observed object, named 2024 PT5, was spotted near Earth last August and is thought to be a lunar fragment, possibly blasted off the Moon during a massive impact long ago. This makes it only the second known piece of the Moon found orbiting in near-Earth space. ""If there were only one object, that would be interesting but an outlier,"" said Teddy Kareta, a planetary scientist at Lowell Observatory in Arizona. ""If there's two, we're pretty confident that's a population."" The findings were published inThe Astrophysical Journal Lettersin January and presented in March at the 56th Lunar and Planetary Sciences Conference in Texas. 2024 PT5 stood out when it was first observed by astronomers in South Africa, thanks to its unusually slow movement, just 2 metres per second relative to Earth. That made it a promising candidate for the Mission Accessible Near-Earth Object Survey (MANOS), which focuses on finding asteroids that are easiest to reach with spacecraft.  The rock, just 26 to 39 feet (8 to 12 metres) wide, didn't look like a typical asteroid. Mr Kareta and his team believe it may have been ejected from the Moon's surface during a violent impact. The discovery suggests that other such fragments might be hiding in near-Earth space. Earth regularly travels through a cloud of debris, both natural and man-made, as it orbits the Sun. Some of it is leftover rock from the early solar system, and scientists keep a close eye on these near-Earth objects (NEOs) in case any pose a threat. Material that gets blasted off the Moon during an impact usually stays close to Earth's orbit, especially the slower pieces. 2024 PT5 was briefly called a minimoon in September because it moved alongside Earth for a short time. But it didn't stay for long and eventually drifted away. Scientists think it will come close to Earth again in 2055. Within a week of the discovery, Mr Kareta and MANOS principal investigator Nick Moskovitz turned the Lowell Discovery Telescope toward 2024 PT5. After analysing the rock in visible and near-infrared light, they found its composition closely resembled moon rocks brought back by the Apollo missions and the Soviet Luna 24 mission. ""It's like realising a crime scene has a totally new kind of evidence you didn't know you had before,"" Mr Kareta toldSpace.com. ""It might not help you solve the crime right away, but considering the importance of the task, new details to compare are always welcome."" This is only the second known lunar fragment spotted in near-Earth space. The first, called Kamo'oalewa, was discovered in 2016 and linked to the Moon in 2021.",2025-05-04 17:02:27,general,Positive

In a statement on Telegram, the Kremlin said that Xi will discuss with Russian President Vladimir Putin the development of the two countries' strategic partnership, as well as signing a number of documents. ""During the talks, the main issues of further development of relations of comprehensive partnership and strategic interaction, as well as current issues on the international and regional agenda will be discussed,"" the Kremlin said. The Soviet Union lost 27 million people in World War Two but pushed Nazi forces back to Berlin, where Hitler committed suicide and the red Soviet Victory Banner was raised over the Reichstag in 1945. Several other national leaders are expected at the celebrations, including the presidents of Brazil and Serbia, and the prime minister of Slovakia.  Putin has proposed a three day ceasefire with Ukraine around the May 9 celebration, one of the most important in the Russian calendar. Responding to Moscow's offer of the three-day ceasefire, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said he was ready as long as the ceasefire would be 30 days in length, something Putin had already ruled out in the near term, saying he wants a long-term settlement not a brief pause. Zelenskiy said Ukraine, given the continued war with Russia, could not guarantee the safety of any foreign dignitaries who came to Moscow for the traditional May 9 victory parade.

In his report, he suggested a slew of measures, including setting up an inquiry commission and outposts of central forces in districts bordering Bangladesh, besides writing, ""needless to add, the provisions under Article 356 of the Constitution also remain"". Asked about the mention of ""the provisions under Article 356 of the Constitution"" in the report, an official told PTI, ""The governor has not proposed for implementation of Article 356. He meant to say that the provisions of Article 356 of the Constitution are open to the Centre if the situation in the state further deteriorates."" The imposition of Article 356 of the Constitution refers to the President's rule in a state. The governor also expressed apprehension about a ""spillover"" of the Murshidabad violence to other districts of the state and recommended that the central government should consider ""constitutional options to put a check on the current situation besides generating confidence of people in the rule of law"".  ""The twin spectre of radicalisation and militancy poses a serious challenge for West Bengal, especially in two of the several districts sharing an international border with Bangladesh, viz., Murshidabad and Malda. In both these districts, there is an adverse demographic composition with Hindus being minorities. Another district, viz., Uttar Dinajpur, has a plurality,"" Mr Bose mentioned in his report, a copy of which is with PTI. The governor suggested several measures in the aftermath of violence that claimed the lives of at least three people, including a man and his son, and left several injured. The riot occurred amid anti-Waqf (Amendment) Act protests. ""Formulating an overarching legislation to empower the Union Government to maintain law and order when the state machinery fails to act effectively. Appointing a commission of Inquiry under the Commissions of Inquiry Act, 1952, to look into the reported acts of omission and commission as indicated above and to suggest measures to prevent such incidents in future and needless to add, the provisions under Article 356 of the Constitution also remain,"" the report mentioned. Of late, there are ""indications of radicalisation and polarisation"", it said. ""The divisions are so deep that even in the face of escalation of violence, the chief minister's repeated 'undertaking' that she would protect minority interests, and that the Act would not be implemented in the state, have done little to assuage the Muslim community or stem the tide. It is imperative that the rule of law must be firmly established, and the police must prevent violence,"" Mr Bose wrote in the report. The governor also said, ""To go by the history of political violence that the state is prone to and from the spillover effect that the Murshidabad violence had over other districts in the state, may I suggest that the Government of India considers the Constitutional options not only to put a check on the current situation but also to generate confidence of people in the rule of law."" In the report, the Bengal governor also claimed that the riots appeared ""premeditated"" and the state government was ""aware of the imminent build-up of a threat to law and order in Murshidabad"". ""As the Notification of the Waqf (Amendment) Act, 2025 was issued on 08.04.2025, conflagration unfolded in Murshidabad district that spiralled out of control and continued for several days. On 08.04.2025, the state government promulgated temporary suspension order of internet...Thus, the state government was aware of the imminent build-up of threat to law and order in Murshidabad,"" Mr Bose alleged in his report. It was expected that the state government also put in place a ""viable security mechanism on the ground that could prevent any occurrence and escalation of violence"", he said. ""Clearly, the sequence of events that unfolded shows the woeful lack of coordination among administration and law enforcement agencies that were either too feeble to rise up to the challenge or were reluctant to do so,"" Mr Bose alleged. The ruling TMC functionaries and the state government officials could not be reached for their comments on the governor's report.

Viyana Jain, daughter of IT professionals Piyush and Varsha Jain, was diagnosed with brain tumour last December. After surgery and treatment failed, the family turned to spiritual guidance. On March 21, during a visit to Jain monk Rajesh Muni Maharaj, the child was given theSantharavow with her parents' consent. Minutes later, she died. What IsSanthara? Santhara, also known asSallekhana, is a Jain religious practice in which an individual voluntarily chooses to end their life through fasting, according toA Sundara, head of the Department of Archaeology and Museums in Karnataka. The practice involves gradually abstaining from food and water, and is undertaken by Jains as a way to purify the soul and attain liberation. The vow cannot be taken at will. According to A Sundara's research, Jain scriptures clearly say thatSantharashould only be observed when death is near, or when a person is unable to follow religious duties due to old age, incurable illness, or extreme conditions like famine.  For example, if someone's worsening eyesight leads them to unknowingly harm living beings – violating the principle ofahimsa– they may chooseSanthara. The Practice OfSanthara An importantJain textfrom around the 4th century AD,Ratnakaranda Shravakacharaby Samantabhadra, gives a clear explanation of theSantharavow and how it should be followed. The text says that this vow should be taken to free the soul from the body, but only during extreme situations – like a natural disaster, old age, or an illness that cannot be cured. Anyone taking the vow must control their emotions, give up all their possessions, and mentally detach from loved ones. They should forgive everyone, ask for forgiveness, and feel sorry for their wrongdoings. Then, with a peaceful mind, they should focus on prayers and slowly stop eating and drinking and fast until death. IsSantharaLegal? WhileSantharais an accepted and revered practice in Jainism, it hasfaced legal challengesin India. In 2015, the Rajasthan High Court ruled thatSantharashould be considered illegal, equating it to suicide under Section 306 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). The court's reasoning was that the voluntary decision to end one's life was a form of self-harm and could not be justified as a religious practice. The ruling, however, was met with protests from the Jain community. A month later, theSupreme Court stayed the order, allowingSantharato continue under religious freedom protections.",2025-05-04 18:04:24,general,Negative

Now, the 'Omkara' actor has cleared the air around his remark saying that he had apologized for being evil in the film, and not for the film itself. Setting the record straight, she said, “I apologized to Tim for being the evil villain in the film. I was growling and smashing everyone in sight! He said next time you should play the hero. I stand by all my films, and this one too.”  Saif was in conversation with his 'Jewel Thief', co-star Jaideep Ahlawat during a segment on Netflix India's YouTube channel, where he shared that his son was not impressed by ""Adipurush"". Looking back at the experience, Saif revealed, “My son and I were watching the film recently, and I understood that it was bad. My son gave me a look as if to ask why he was being made to watch it, and I understood the situation. I quickly apologised to him.” Saif essayed the role of Lankesh, a character based on Ravana in the retelling of the epic tale of Ramayana. The project which also saw Prabhas and Kriti Sanon as the lead turned out to be a box office debacle with director Om Raut's directorial facing criticism for poor VFX, and mediocre dialogues. Recently, speaking with Ted Sarandos, Co-CEO of Netflix during WAVES Summit 2025, Saif opened up about the kind of content he likes to watch the most. He revealed, “I like historical films. Maybe films about other cultures, maybe Japanese. I am also very excited to see our culture on the big screens. The Mahabharata is the greatest story ever told, it's one of our great epics. I also like to watch massive war scenes, bringing life, history, and a past that is related to books. I would like to see that kind of atmosphere in movies. And I feel the long-form streaming format is just perfect for it.” (Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",2025-05-04 18:54:29,general,Positive

Rituals continued at the Sree Lairai Devi temple at Shirgaon in North Goa district with hundreds of devotees arriving on foot despite the temple committee appealing to people to stay away. A stampede broke out in the early hours of Saturday as thousands of devotees thronged the narrow lanes leading up to the temple. While six persons died, about 70 were injured. The fact-finding committee constituted by the Goa government is recording the statements of senior officials in charge of crowd management at the event.  The committee is headed by Sandeep Jacques, commissioner and secretary (revenue), with deputy inspector general Varsha Sharma, Director of Transport Pravimal Abhishek and Superintendent of Police Tikam Singh Verma are its members. Talking to PTI, a senior government official said the stampede broke out on a sloping ground which is prone to such accidents. ""We have learnt that a similar incident, on a minor scale, had happened at the same spot during last year's festival,"" he said. The committee will investigate why precautions were not taken this year, he added. ""The committee has recorded the statements of Collector Sneha Gitte, Superintendent of Police Akshat Kaushal, Deputy Superintendent of Police Jivba Dalvi, Deputy Collector Bhimnath Khorjuvekar, members of the temple committee and others,"" he said. The panel will need at least a couple of more days to gather inputs and file a report, the official said. It is also looking into reports that a fight between two groups of devotees triggered the stampede, he said. Despite the lanes leading to the temple being narrow, the temple committee had allowed shops to be set up on the route, adding to congestion, the official said. Director General of Police Alok Kumar had on Saturday said 30,000 to 40,000 people had gathered for the annual festival when some people standing on the slope fell, causing others to tumble and fall on each other. Goa Medical College and Hospital's medical superintendent Dr Rajesh Patil, meanwhile, said three out of the five persons who were seriously injured in the stampede were showing signs of improvement on Sunday. A total of 14 patients were admitted and only one has been discharged so far, he told PTI. Importantly, the condition of none of the critical patients has worsened, said Dr Patil. Goa Governor P S Sreedharan Pillai who visited the families of those who were killed in the stampede said the incident was ""beyond human expectation"". The government was doing its best to help the victims, he said. Notwithstanding the tragedy, hundreds of devotees visited the village on Sunday, walking at least two km to take part in a ritual where the goddess (her idol) 'visits' the houses of local residents. The ritual follows a day after the 'homkhand' rite during which devotees walk on the embers of a big fire lit in the temple grounds. Dinanath Gaonkar, president of the temple committee, said it was not possible to cancel the ritual. ""The incident on Saturday was unfortunate. Lives were lost. But we can not stop the rituals,"" he said. The temple committee had made an appeal to devotees to avoid visiting the village, he said. ""The police have also placed barricades in Assanora to stop vehicles from entering the area,"" he said. Yet, many were seen walking to the village on Sunday. Stalls set up in the lanes around the temple too remained open. A local resident said, ""You cannot stop people from attending the festival, as Devi Lairai is a revered deity with devotees across Goa, Maharashtra and Karnataka.""

The protest was called by Hefazat-e-Islam-- an influential Bangladeshi Islamist group-- claiming that some of the proposed recommendations hurt ""the sentiments of the majority of the people of this country"". Leaders of the Hefazat-e-Islam group claimed that draft recommendations of the Women's Affairs Reform Commission instituted by the Muhammad Yunus' interim government are contradictory to Sharia law. The group threatened a nationwide protest on May 23 if the government didn't meet their demands. Over 20,000 followers of the group rallied near the Dhaka University, some carrying banners and placards reading ""Say no to Western laws on our women, rise up Bangladesh"", in one of their biggest public shows of strength in years as religious activism surged in Bangladesh following the ouster of deposed prime minister Sheikh Hasina's Awami League regime last year. Protestors mostly included teachers and students of non-government or ""kawmi"" madrassas. Islamist groups in Bangladesh have increased their visibility since former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's ouster, and minority groups have complained of being intimidated.  The protestors mainly denounced proposed recommendations for ensuring equal rights, including ones related to property, for mainly Muslim women. Nayeb-e-Ameer or senior leader of the platform, Maulana Mahfuzul Huq, announced a 12-point charter of demands, with the first one being the abolition of the existing women reform commission and its members punished for the proposed changes, and constituting a new one comprising Islamic scholars and women representatives. He said the commission's proposed changes hurt ""the sentiments of the majority of the people of this country"" by labelling the religious laws of inheritance as the main cause of inequality between men and women. The group's leaders also demanded that the interim government led by Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad punus ban the Awami League party led by former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who was ousted in August. Hasina's opponents accuse her government of killing hundreds of students and others during the uprising that ended her 15-year rule. Hasina has been in exile in India since her ouster. ""Men and women can never be equal,"" a women's madrassa teacher, Mohammad Shihab Uddin, told the rally, adding that the Quran outlined specific codes of life for both genders and ""there is no way we can go beyond that"". The Hefazat called for reinstating ""complete faith and trust in almighty Allah"" in the constitution and asked the government to abandon the ""suicidal concept"" of pluralism and to protect what they said were the Muslims' faith and practices. The group also opposed the inclusion of terms such as ""gender identity,"" ""gender diversity,"" ""gender equality,"" ""gender discrimination,"" ""third gender,"" and ""other genders"". It argued that these are used to promote LGBT and transgender inclusion under ambiguous slogans such as ""Leave no one behind"" and ""inclusive"" and feared that these ideas could lead to a ""destructive, anti-religious pro-homosexual society"". The Women's Affairs Reform Commission is one of the several commissions instituted by the interim government to carry out reform. It had recently submitted its recommendations to the government.",2025-05-04 19:13:17,general,Positive

Claiming responsibility for the attack, Houthis said they acted in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza. In a video posted to his personal X account, Netanyahu said Israel's retaliation for the Houthi attack will not be a 'one-and-done' situation, and ""there will be blows"" in response to the attack. ""We are acting against them,"" the Israeli premier said, referring to previous Israeli Defence Force (IDF) operations against the Houthis in Yemen. צפו בעדכון חשוב ממני אליכם >>pic.twitter.com/hLLodqVnPz ""We have acted in the past, and we will act in the future. I cannot detail everything. The United States, in coordination with us, is also acting against them. It's not a one-and-done, but there will be blows,"" said Netanyahu. Israel's Defence Minister, Israel Katz, has also vowed a forceful response against the Iran-aligned Houthis. ""Whoever harms us, we'll harm them sevenfold,"" he said. A ballistic missile fired by Houthis landed just 75 meters from Terminal 3 of Ben Gurion Airport outside Tel Aviv. It reportedly bypassed four layers of air defence and hit a grove adjacent to an access road within the airport's perimeter--one of the country's most sensitive zones-- creating a 25-metre deep crater.  Israel Defence Forces (IDF) said their several attempts to intercept the missile failed before it landed near the airport, sending a plume of smoke into the air. However, a direct hit on terminal infrastructure was averted, yet it caused panic among passengers in the terminal building. Israel has a US-made THAAD system along with an indigenous Arrow system to intercept the missile, but both of them failed to stop the attack today. Authorities have launched a full-scale investigation into the breach of Israel's air defence and the missile's impact site. At least eight people were injured in the attack, Magen David Adom (MDA), Israel's national emergency service, said. Claiming responsibility, Houthi military spokesperson Yahya Saree said Israel's main airport was ""no longer safe for air travel"". Sunday's strike came as Israeli ministers were reported to be close to signing off on plans to expand the military operation in Gaza, which resumed in March following a two-month truce, prompting the Houthis to hit Israel with more missiles. Efforts to revive the ceasefire have faltered, and US President Donald Trump in March ordered large-scale strikes against the Houthis to reduce their capabilities and deter them from targeting commercial shipping in the Red Sea. The strikes have killed hundreds of people in Yemen. The Houthis, who control swathes of Yemen, began targeting Israel and Red Sea shipping in late 2023, during the early days of the war between Hamas and Israel in the Gaza Strip.",2025-05-04 19:53:08,general,Negative

Following a vote at the Berkshire Hathaway board of directors over the weekend, Buffett will step down as chief executive of the world's 8th-largest company by market capitalization on January 1, 2026, and hand over the reins to the group's current vice-chairman, Greg Abel. The vote, which was proposed by Buffett, will bring to an end the revered investor's more than half-a-century running the group, which he turned into a financial behemoth. ""The time has arrived where Greg (Abel) should become the chief executive officer of the company at year end,"" Buffett, 94, told an annual shareholder meeting in Omaha, the city in the Midwestern state of Nebraska where Berkshire is based. Abel, 62, had been nominated to succeed Buffett in 2021.

Berkshire Hathaway, a former small textile company, has grown over the years into a gigantic conglomerate under Buffett's leadership, and is now worth over $1 trillion on Wall Street -- a first for an American group outside the tech sector. Warren Buffett preferred to invest for the long term in stable companies whose accounts he had closely scrutinized, enabling him to build up the world's fifth-largest fortune over the decades.

The employment tribunal hearing the case declared that Joanne Neil, who worked for Dermalogica UK, should not have been made redundant in the manner the skincare firm did, as she was denied labour rights. The tribunal in Croydon, South London, found the sacking had ""significantly worsened"" Ms Neil's mental health, with which she had already been struggling, according to a report inThe Telegraph. She received the news of her sacking through a Microsoft Teams meeting where she wasn't given any opportunity to ask questions to the HR about the entire process. ""The short notice period she was given of the meeting and the misleading title of the invite 'catch up', meant she was unprepared and blindsided,"" said Judge Liz Ord. The meeting took place on Ms Neil's non-working day with her manager, Ian White and another executive on the call. She was told that she had ""unfortunately"" been selected to receive the sack. ""The announcement plunged her into a state of shock and despair, significantly setting back her state of mental health.""

Struggling to cope, Ms Neil often broke down in front of her colleagues but could not take an off as she was only entitled to two days' sick pay per year. The employment tribunal noted that Ms Neil's firing was indirect sex discrimination as she was selected for redundancy on the basis of her hours, which was a breach of the part-time workers' regulations since women were more likely to work part-time.

The employment tribunal hearing the case declared that Joanne Neil, who worked for Dermalogica UK, should not have been made redundant in the manner the skincare firm did, as she was denied labour rights. The tribunal in Croydon, South London, found the sacking had ""significantly worsened"" Ms Neil's mental health, with which she had already been struggling, according to a report inThe Telegraph. She received the news of her sacking through a Microsoft Teams meeting where she wasn't given any opportunity to ask questions to the HR about the entire process. ""The short notice period she was given of the meeting and the misleading title of the invite 'catch up', meant she was unprepared and blindsided,"" said Judge Liz Ord. The meeting took place on Ms Neil's non-working day with her manager, Ian White and another executive on the call. She was told that she had ""unfortunately"" been selected to receive the sack. ""The announcement plunged her into a state of shock and despair, significantly setting back her state of mental health."" Also Read | Missing For 60 Years, Wisconsin Woman Found ""Alive and Well"" The court documents revealed that Ms Neill was identified for redundancy in November 2022. She had begun to struggle with her mental health in January 2022, but was not allowed to work her two days a week from home.  Struggling to cope, Ms Neil often broke down in front of her colleagues but could not take an off as she was only entitled to two days' sick pay per year. The employment tribunal noted that Ms Neil's firing was indirect sex discrimination as she was selected for redundancy on the basis of her hours, which was a breach of the part-time workers' regulations since women were more likely to work part-time. Notably, Ms Neill got to keep her job after another employee left the department.",2025-05-05 23:03:40,general,Negative

""This was my biggest fear my whole life, before captivity, during captivity. And it happened to me after captivity, in my safest place,"" she said, according to Israeli newspaperHaaretz.

When the first meeting fell through, she agreed to host a second meeting at her home.

It can carry on simultaneous development on all fronts, that would get it to the developed country milestone within 20 years, by 2047, the research said. In its report titled ""Innovating out of the Middle-Income Trap,"" the Chintan Research Foundation has suggested that a linear approach need not be followed by a country like India that has a young, strong and skilled work force. A nation can advance by simultaneously investing in solid infrastructure, judiciously infusing foreign expertise (with caution), and nurturing local innovation ecosystems nations can craft a balanced development pathway, the report has suggested. The accepted model of advancement comes from last year's World Development Report from the World Bank. The report, titled ""The Middle-Income Trap"", suggests that middle income nations follow a linear sequence.  When a country is low-income, investment in infrastructure is required. Low-middle-income nations should begin ""infusion"" and only when it crosses the threshold of $14,000 per capita income, it can focus on ""innovating"" the received technology and exporting it globally. But India, the Chintan Research Foundation report said, is in a hurry to achieve developed country status - Viksit@47 - and ""does not have the luxury to follow the sequential approach to development"" as suggested in the World Development Report. Viksit Bharat is not a leap of faith but a calculated extension of measurable and maintainable trends. The report said the World Bank's cautionary stance on ""leapfrogging"" (jumping from investment to innovation without following infusion) negates the possibility of faster progress. It reinforces the traditional (view) 'others took 20 years to this path, so you should take the same amount of time too.' The CRF said its research shows that scientific production is in progress, Indian researchers match or outpace many upper-middle-income peers and talent is flowing toward discovery rather than away from it.",2025-05-05 23:51:58,general,Positive

Nearly 1,800 jewels - pearls, rubies, sapphires, topaz, garnets, coral, amethysts, rock crystals, shells and gold - were discovered alongside bone fragments identified as belonging to the Buddha, from a stupa in Piprahwa, near his birthplace in Uttar Pradesh in 1898. The items are scheduled to be auctioned on Wednesday, with Sotheby's estimating the value at around HK$100 million (around Rs 107 crore). In a statement, the culture ministry said it has gathered information on the auction and issued a legal notice to Sotheby's. ""The Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) also requested the Consulate General of Hong Kong to take up the matter with authorities there demanding the immediate cessation of the auction,"" it said. In its statement, the Centre said the relics, which assume immense historical and spiritual significance, were excavated by William Claxton Peppe in 1898.  ""An inscription in Brahmi script on one of the caskets confirms these as relics of the Buddha, deposited by the Sakya clan,"" it said. A majority of these relics were transferred to the Indian Museum in Kolkata in 1899 and are classified as 'AA' antiquities under Indian law,  prohibiting their removal or sale, it added. While a portion of the bone relics was gifted to the King of Siam, a selection retained by Peppe's descendants has now been listed for auction, it said. The culture ministry said the Financial Investigation Unit (FIU) has been asked to coordinate with its counterpart in Hong Kong to highlight the illegality of the auction and ensure compliance with international laws. ""The Ministry of Culture remains steadfast in its efforts to protect India's cultural heritage and ensure the repatriation of the Piprahwa Relics.

Sotheby's Response To India's Notice The ministry, in its statement, said that Ivy Wong, Associate General Counsel, Sotheby's, responded to the notice and assured ""full attention"" in the matter. Earlier, Nicolas Chow, chairman of Sotheby's Asia, called the relics ""among the most extraordinary archaeological discoveries of all time"". The auction house described the offering as being ""of unparalleled religious, archaeological and historical importance"", as perThe Guardian. Chris Peppe, great-grandson of William Claxton Peppe and one of the current owners, defended the decision to sell the relics.

A nation can advance by simultaneously investing in solid infrastructure, judiciously infusing foreign expertise (with caution), and nurturing local innovation ecosystems nations can craft a balanced development pathway, the report has suggested. The accepted model of advancement comes from last year's World Development Report from the World Bank. The report, titled ""The Middle-Income Trap"", suggests that middle income nations follow a linear sequence.  When a country is low-income, investment in infrastructure is required. Low-middle-income nations should begin ""infusion"" and only when it crosses the threshold of $14,000 per capita income, it can focus on ""innovating"" the received technology and exporting it globally. But India, the Chintan Research Foundation report said, is in a hurry to achieve developed country status - Viksit@47 - and ""does not have the luxury to follow the sequential approach to development"" as suggested in the World Development Report. Viksit Bharat is not a leap of faith but a calculated extension of measurable and maintainable trends. The report said the World Bank's cautionary stance on ""leapfrogging"" (jumping from investment to innovation without following infusion) negates the possibility of faster progress. It reinforces the traditional (view) 'others took 20 years to this path, so you should take the same amount of time too.' The CRF said its research shows that scientific production is in progress, Indian researchers match or outpace many upper-middle-income peers and talent is flowing toward discovery rather than away from it.",2025-05-05 23:52:08,general,Positive

Nearly 1,800 jewels - pearls, rubies, sapphires, topaz, garnets, coral, amethysts, rock crystals, shells and gold - were discovered alongside bone fragments identified as belonging to the Buddha, from a stupa in Piprahwa, near his birthplace in Uttar Pradesh in 1898. The items are scheduled to be auctioned on Wednesday, with Sotheby's estimating the value at around HK$100 million (around Rs 107 crore). In a statement, the culture ministry said it has gathered information on the auction and issued a legal notice to Sotheby's. ""The Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) also requested the Consulate General of Hong Kong to take up the matter with authorities there demanding the immediate cessation of the auction,"" it said. In its statement, the Centre said the relics, which assume immense historical and spiritual significance, were excavated by William Claxton Peppe in 1898.  ""An inscription in Brahmi script on one of the caskets confirms these as relics of the Buddha, deposited by the Sakya clan,"" it said. A majority of these relics were transferred to the Indian Museum in Kolkata in 1899 and are classified as 'AA' antiquities under Indian law,  prohibiting their removal or sale, it added. While a portion of the bone relics was gifted to the King of Siam, a selection retained by Peppe's descendants has now been listed for auction, it said. The culture ministry said the Financial Investigation Unit (FIU) has been asked to coordinate with its counterpart in Hong Kong to highlight the illegality of the auction and ensure compliance with international laws. ""The Ministry of Culture remains steadfast in its efforts to protect India's cultural heritage and ensure the repatriation of the Piprahwa Relics. We call upon Sotheby's Hong Kong to immediately withdraw the relics from auction and cooperate with Indian authorities to return these sacred artifacts to their rightful place,"" the statement said. Sotheby's Response To India's Notice The ministry, in its statement, said that Ivy Wong, Associate General Counsel, Sotheby's, responded to the notice and assured ""full attention"" in the matter. Earlier, Nicolas Chow, chairman of Sotheby's Asia, called the relics ""among the most extraordinary archaeological discoveries of all time"". The auction house described the offering as being ""of unparalleled religious, archaeological and historical importance"", as perThe Guardian. Chris Peppe, great-grandson of William Claxton Peppe and one of the current owners, defended the decision to sell the relics. He said the family explored donating the items to temples and museums, but ran into obstacles. The auction was ""the fairest and most transparent way to transfer these relics to Buddhists,"" he told the BBC.",2025-05-05 23:52:11,general,Positive

Pakistan, currently a non-permanent member of the powerful 15-nation Security Council, had requested for ""closed consultations"" on the situation. Greece, president of the Council for the month of May, scheduled the meeting for May 5 in the afternoon. The closed-door meeting will not take place in the UNSC Chamber where Council members sit at the powerful horse-shoe table but in a consultations room next to the chamber. Assistant Secretary-General for Middle East, Asia and the Pacific in the Departments of Political and Peacebuilding Affairs and Peace Operations Khaled Mohamed Khiari of Tunisia will brief the Council on behalf of both departments (DPPA and DPO). Pakistan's Permanent Representative to the United Nations Ambassador Asim Iftikhar Ahmad could brief reporters after the meeting. Just hours before the closed consultations, Guterres voiced concern over tensions between India and Pakistan being at ""their highest in years"", saying ""it pains me to see relations reaching a boiling point"". Guterres made remarks to the press from the UNSC stake-out Monday morning amid rising tensions between the two nuclear-armed neighbours following the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack in Jammu and Kashmir that killed 26 civilians, including a Nepali citizen.  Guterres said he understands the ""raw feelings"" following the ""awful terror attack"" in Pahalgam and reiterated his strong condemnation of that attack, extending his condolences to the families of the victims. ""Targeting civilians is unacceptable – and those responsible must be brought to justice through credible and lawful means,"" he said. Guterres stressed that it is essential – especially at this critical hour—to avoid a military confrontation that could easily spin out of control. ""Now is the time for maximum restraint and stepping back from the brink. That has been my message in my ongoing outreach with both countries. Make no mistake: A military solution is no solution,"" the UN chief said. He reiterated that he offers his good offices to both governments in the service of peace. ""The United Nations stands ready to support any initiative that promotes de-escalation, diplomacy, and a renewed commitment to peace."" Apart from the five veto-wielding permanent members—China, France, Russia, UK and the US—the 10 non-permanent members in the Council are Algeria, Denmark, Greece, Guyana, Pakistan, Panama, South Korea, Sierra Leone, Slovenia and Somalia. India's former Permanent Representative to the UN Ambassador Syed Akbaruddin told PTI that no ""consequential outcome"" can be expected from ""a discussion where a party to the conflict seeks to shape perceptions by using its membership of the Council. India will parry such Pakistani efforts"". (Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",2025-05-06 01:25:15,general,Positive

https://www.ndtvprofit.com/markets/silver-nears-55-surpasses-october-highs-mcx-rate-crosses-rs-166-lakh,,,"US spot silver price rose 2.5% to near $55 an ounce on Friday, thereby surpassing the record high it clocked in October. The precious metal reached an intraday high of $54.75 per ounce so far. At 19:47 hours (IST), it was trading at $54.57, up 2.2% from the previous day's close. Reflecting the rise in global prices, the rates jumped on India's Multi Commodity Exchange (MCX) as well, where silver futures were trading 2.5% higher at Rs 1.66 lakh per kilogram. This was close to the all-time high of Rs 1.7 lakh a kg recorded on the MCX last month. In the US spot market, silver rose to an all-time high of $54.48 per ounce on Oct. 17. Since then, the prices began easing significantly, and the metal remained range-bound between $40-50 an ounce over the past month. Notably, silver crossed the $40-mark on Oct. 9, as the metal's price rose sharply due to an unprecedented squeeze in physical silver supply. In India, the price also surged during the month due to massive festive season demand. Silver exchange-traded-funds traded at hot-air premiums in October, rising by 5-10% each, as the precious metal's demand soared amid a global shortage. This had led to several mutual funds halting fresh inflows into their silver fund-of-funds, citing the sharp shortage in physical silver supply. However, the frenzy around silver ETFs cooled in the third week of October, after global prices softened and the London Bullion Market Association projected an ease in the supply situation. The fresh jump in silver prices comes amid increasing odds of a rate cut by the US Federal Reserve in December. Silver, similar to gold, gains strength in a low-interest environment. Both the metals are seen as hedge against inflation. Gold prices remained upbeat on Friday, rising nearly 1% to $4,197.01 an ounce in the US spot market. On India's MCX, the yellow metal was trading 0.76% higher at Rs 1,26,453 per 10 gram at 20:28 hours (IST).",2025-11-28 20:31:17,general,Positive

The famous fast food chain aims to scale up its global sales to $1.32 billion or 1 billion pounds, news agencyReutersreported. In the backdrop of a growing middle class and a rise in protein consumption in the country, CEO of German Doner Kebab Simon Wallis toldReutersthat he finds India to be a ""ripe"" market for their product. Therefore, he said that he views the country as an integral part of the chain's growth plan. Wallis cited India's ""thriving economy"" as one of the reasons why a number of brands are attracted to the Indian market. An array of global brands like Little Caesars and Papa John's International (PZZA.O) are scaling up in India, despite sales slowing down for Yum Brands' KFC and Pizza Hut amid consumer cutbacks. The GDK CEO said that he sees this as an opportunity for ""newer and more disruptive brands to emerge"" in the land. The fast-food chain is anticipating an early 2026 entry in India after launching a nationwide expansion under a master franchise deal with Middle East-based bakery product supplier GBC India. The famous kebab chain will tailor make its menu for India and skip on beef options just like McDonald's and Burger King, who had opted for lamb items to adhere to local preferences. Clarifying the company’s stance on going public, Wallis contradicted predecessor Imran Sayeed’s views and said that their only focus right now is to achieve the 1 billion pound sales milestone. In 2022, Sayeed had implied plans to list on the New York Stock Exchange within three to five years.

The intense 144-hour search for Salman ended in a dramatic arrest in Bhopal, followed by a shocking escape attempt that ended with police opening fire. According to police sources, Salman had trekked into Bhopal through the forest, dodging checkpoints, and had been hiding in the Gandhi Nagar locality. He had no mobile phone, no documents, and was in an inebriated state when caught. As soon as news broke of his detention, workers of the Jai Maa Bhavani Hindu organization rushed to the Gandhi Nagar police station but by then, Salman had already been taken away by Gauharganj police, who had taken him into custody, and left immediately. After the arrest, tension flared in the city. On Friday morning, leaders of the Hindu Utsav Samiti and Sanskriti Bachao Manch reached Hamidia Hospital, raising slogans and demanding harsh action.  Committee president Chandrashekhar Tiwari, accusing the administration of a ""weak information system"" that allowed the accused to hide in Bhopal for days, said ""the accused should be shot dead."" The real twist came from Naya Basti, where two young men - Abdul Rizwan and Asif - played the most crucial role in arresting the fugitive. Speaking exclusively to NDTV, Abdul Rizwan recounted the tense moment. ""I recognized him from a photo on social media. He was roaming around Sector-11 asking for a house to rent. Our boys noticed he had no ID, no registration. He looked exactly like the Raisen accused. He was drunk. We kept him detained from 10 pm to 11:15 pm until the Gauharganj police arrived."" Rizwan said the accused kept trying to escape, but the group kept him engaged until the police reached. ""He asked for a room to rent, but when we asked for an ID card, he said he had nothing. He claimed he slept on the footpath. We detained him. He kept trying to leave, so we stopped him on the pretext of offering him tea. Then the Crime Branch team arrived and took him away."" The youths say Salman told them he had no family support, his mother had died and he lived alone in Karond.

Hours after Venugopal alleged that the Left government in Kerala was working according to the wishes of the BJP government at the Centre, Sivankutty hit back at the Congress leader, accusing him of giving ""wrong advice"" to Rahul Gandhi, the Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha. Speaking to reporters in New Delhi, Venugopal alleged that the Left government had tried to implement the Labour Code of the central government despite pro-Left trade unions, including CITU and AITUC, expressing concern over it. He also cited the recent signing of the PM SHRI project by the Left government and said such steps were extremely condemnable.  Facing strong resistance from its major coalition partner, the CPI, the CPI(M)-led government last month decided to put on hold the implementation of the Centre's PM SHRI scheme in the state, days after a memorandum of understanding (MoU) was signed in this regard in New Delhi. Responding to the allegations, Sivankutty told media in Thiruvananthapuram that Venugopal is ""the great leader who deliberately gave up"" his Rajya Sabha candidature in order to ensure a majority for the BJP in the Upper House. ""By giving Rahul Gandhi wrong advice, he is implementing a strategy that weakens the Congress in every state where elections are held. Instead of strengthening the party, he is trying to destroy it,"" alleged Sivankutty, who holds both the Labour and Education portfolios in the Pinarayi Vijayan-led government. ""Even when central investigative agencies have targeted Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi, one must think about why only K C Venugopal -- the organisational general secretary who leads the Congress -- remains completely safe. This is proof that there is an active internal nexus between him and the BJP,"" the CPI(M) leader alleged. He also claimed that Venugopal's next goal is to prepare the ground for the BJP in Kerala. ""Every Congress worker and leader must recognise this move, through which he is digging a pit for his own party,"" Sivankutty alleged, referring to Venugopal's frequent interventions in Kerala politics. The Left government in Kerala had recently found itself in a difficult position after a draft regulation linked to the Centre's Labour Codes--introduced three years ago--came to light. The Left parties have been strongly opposing these labour codes at the national level, calling them ""anti-worker"". The draft regulation, however, had already been notified in the state on December 14, 2021. Following media reports, Sivankutty was forced to issue a clarification on Thursday, saying that the Centre's Labour Codes would not be implemented in the state.

The victim, Debobrata Mondal, alias Babu Mondal, a member of the Sampuipara-Basukathi gram panchayat, was returning home around 11 pm on a motorcycle with his associate Anupam Rana when the attack took place near the Nishchinda-Buro Shibtala area under Liluah police station limits, a senior police officer said on Friday. According to police, two motorcycle-borne assailants approached them and fired several rounds at close range. Mondal was hit in the waist and shoulder and collapsed on the spot, while Anupam sustained bullet injuries when he tried to resist the attackers. Local residents rushed both men to Belur State General Hospital. Mondal was later shifted to SSKM Hospital in Kolkata, where he succumbed to his injuries, hospital sources said. Anupam, who was taken to a private hospital in North Howrah, remains in critical condition. Howrah Police Commissioner Praveen Tripathy visited the spot with a team soon after the incident. ""A case of murder has been registered. We are examining CCTV camera footage, and efforts are being made to trace the accused,"" he said. Senior Trinamool Congress leaders, including Howrah District (Sadar) president and MLA Goutam Chowdhury, MLA Kalyan Ghosh, and Domjur Youth Trinamool leader Noorj Molla, visited the hospitals where the victims were taken.  MLA Ghosh said the motive behind the attack was still unclear and demanded the immediate arrest of those involved. Police sources said at least five rounds were fired during the assault. Suman Choudhury, who has previous cases of extortion and attempted murder against him, has emerged as a person of interest in the probe. The killing has heightened tensions in the area ahead of the 2026 Assembly elections, with some local TMC workers alleging the involvement of a man known as Basu, though police said all angles were being investigated.

From interesting travel tales to fond movie memories and thoughtful insights, the veteran actress is an open book when it comes to her social media posts. Last year, she shared the story of how the late actor-filmmaker Raj Kapoor cast her as Rupa in the hit 1978 musical romanceSatyam Shivam Sundaram. Zeenat Aman describedSatyam Shivam Sundaramas ""a defining anecdote"" from her career. She wrote, “In December, we will mark the 100th birth anniversary of the extraordinary Raj Kapoor. I have rehashed the story of how he came to cast me as Rupa in Satyam Shivam Sundaram countless times, but here it is for Instagram. A defining anecdote from my career.” A post shared by Zeenat Aman (@thezeenataman) Zeenat Aman retraced her steps back to the 1982Raj Kapoor-led dramaVakil Babu. She said, “It was 1981, and we were shootingVakil Babu. Rajji (Raj Kapoor) was playing the titular role, while his younger brother Shashi Kapoor and I were playing leading roles as each other's love interests. In between takes, while the technicians changed sets and rigged lights, we cast members often found ourselves with time to kill. Now Rajji had a radical approach to his art, and he was brimming with enthusiasm for a film he wanted to make. For days he regaled us with his idea for a story about a man who falls in love with a woman's voice but can't quite reconcile himself to her appearance.”  Zeenat Aman added that Raj Kapoor “never once hinted” that she could be a part of the project. “He spoke with unfettered and rousing passion, but never once even hinted that I could be a part of this film. I was already a star in my own right, and his lack of interest in casting me began to chafe. I knew that my ‘modern image', complete with mini skirts and boots, was the culprit. So I determined to take matters into my own hands,” she said. Revealing how she presented herself as Rupa in front of Raj Kapoor, Zeenat Aman continued, “I knew that Rajji spent much of his spare time at ‘The Cottage' set on the grounds of his sprawling R.K. Studio. It was here that he would hold meetings or host small events, often presiding over these gathering from a pristine mattress placed on the floor. So I made my move. One evening, having wrapped up early from the shoot, I spent an extra 30 minutes in my dressing room making myself up in my own interpretation of Rupa. I put on a ghagra choli, braided my hair with a parandi, and then stuck tissue paper onto my face with glue in an effort to scar my visage.” “When I reached The Cottage I was greeted at the door by John, Rajji's right-hand man. He looked quizzically at me but followed my request - ‘Saabji ko kaho ki Rupa ayi hai',” signed off Zeenat Aman, before adding that she would be continuing the story the next day. A post shared by Zeenat Aman (@thezeenataman) Zeenat Aman has appeared in movies likeDon, Hare Rama Hare Krishna, Yaadon Ki BaraatandDostana, Qurbani.

https://www.ndtvprofit.com/world/hong-kong-blaze-death-toll-climbs-to-128-arrests-widen,,,"Hong Kong’s deadliest fire in nearly eight decades has killed at least 128, officials announced shortly after making fresh arrests in connection with the blaze. Secretary for Security Chris Tang said at a Friday briefing that officials couldn’t rule out finding more bodies. The status of roughly 200 residents remains uncertain, including 89 of the deceased whose identities haven’t been confirmed. Tang also detailed how construction materials erected for renovation work at the estate contributed to the rapid spread of the fire. The blaze began Wednesday on the lower floors of a building in Wang Fuk Court, where netting wrapped around bamboo scaffolding caught fire and ignited highly flammable foam boards installed around windows. The intense heat also set the scaffolding ablaze, causing burning bamboo pieces to fall and ignite additional floors across the eight-tower complex in northern Hong Kong. Director of Fire Services Andy Yeung said problems had been found with the fire alarms in the buildings, which produced no sound. The blaze is the deadliest in Hong Kong since a warehouse fire in 1948 that killed 176 people. The Independent Commission Against Corruption said Friday it had arrested eight people linked to the estate’s renovation: two directors and two project managers of the engineering consultancy responsible for the work, three scaffolding subcontractors - including a married couple that owns the business - and a middleman. Two directors and a consultant from the contractor responsible for the renovation were arrested earlier on suspicion of manslaughter. Inspections had flagged risks well before the disaster. Regulators conducted 16 checks on the renovation project and issued repeated written warnings urging the contractor to put proper fire-prevention measures in place — including as recently as last week, according to the Labour Department. The company handling the HK$315.5 million ($40.6 million) renovation is also working on 11 other residential projects across Hong Kong, officials said. “It’s premature to pass judgment on any officials or even on any companies involved, but I think government should take a good look at our existing legislation,” Hong Kong lawmaker Regina Ip said in a Bloomberg TV interview Friday. That includes identifying any gaps in requirements for fire-retardant materials, whether for major works or small-scale renovations, and stepping up enforcement, she said. Hong Kong Chief Executive John Lee visited the disaster site on Thursday. He earlier ordered a city-wide inspection of all housing estates undergoing major renovations. At a snap briefing, he said each affected family would receive HK$10,000 in relief. Flanked by several officials, he also pledged to completely phase out bamboo scaffolding in favor of metal alternatives. The government announced on Friday that each affected household will receive an additional HK$50,000 in living allowance. The unprecedented high-rise blaze comes at a delicate moment for Hong Kong. The global finance hub has been working to rebuild its international image after mass protests, a national-security crackdown and strict Covid controls drew criticism from some Western governments. Officials are days away from legislative elections — and Lee would be weighing whether to postpone them. Across the city, several events have been canceled. Oxfam Hong Kong called off its popular Trailwalker fundraising race, while Disneyland scrapped a special screening and premiere of Zootopia 2. Other cancellations include the Standard Chartered Arts in the Park festival and a 10-kilometer race organized by Hong Kong Marathon Pro and the Pegasus Athletics Club. While the broader economic impact should be limited, the tragedy points to deeper political problems, according to Gary Ng, senior economist at Natixis. “A series of mistakes by various stakeholders ultimately led to the tragedy,” Ng said, adding that with so many aging buildings across Hong Kong, these issues must be addressed to prevent further economic, social and human losses. The death toll has exceeded that of the Grenfell Tower fire in London, which killed 72 people in June 2017. That blaze was later deemed to be the result of a “catalogue of failures” by the government and construction industry. While that tragedy unfolded in the middle of the night as residents slept, this fire began mid-afternoon when many people would have been awake. Renovation works at Wang Fuk Court were carried out by Prestige Construction & Engineering Co. Bloomberg News visited Prestige’s office on Thursday, but the shutters were down and no one responded despite repeated knocking. Phone calls to the office went unanswered. Residents displaced by the fire will be sheltered in temporary accommodation. About 1,800 units of transitional housing will be made available — roughly equivalent to the estate’s entire housing stock. Volunteers have rushed to the site and corporate donations have poured in, including from the Jockey Club, which pledged up to HK$170 million to support those affected. Deadly fires have prompted major housing policy overhauls in Hong Kong in the past. Most notably, the Shek Kip Mei fire in 1953, which displaced tens of thousands of refugees, led to the start of the city’s public housing program, with the government providing resettlement housing for the residents.",2025-11-28 20:31:41,general,Positive

The fitness coach highlighted early in the conversation how important it is to eat something that gives you ""instant energy"" before working out. “My go-to is a banana and a couple of nuts or a date and a couple of nuts,” she said, while talking about pre-workout meal. These simple, all-natural options offer quick carbs and healthy fats, making them ideal for powering short or intense workouts. She added that this combination remains her ""most favourite pre-workout snack,"" noting its easy digestion — a key factor when eating right before exercising. Yasmin Karachiwala also made it clear that protein should be the main focus of a post-workout meal. “Post-workout, anything with protein,” she said. Protein is essential for rebuilding muscle fibres and supporting overall recovery after physical activity. For non-vegetarians, the fitness trainer suggested eggs as a great option. However, she also recommended a protein shake as a quick and efficient alternative for people who are constantly on the move.  A post shared by The Masoom Minawala Show (@themasoomminawalashow) Yasmin Karachiwala further pointed out that the nutrition industry in India is evolving, with many new protein choices entering the market. “Right now, we have some great protein shakes in the market… which are plant-based, which aren't whey,” she explained. As more people report whey intolerance, the demand for dairy-free options continues to rise. According to Yasmin, Indian brands are now offering ""great protein substitutes"" to meet this growing need. These plant-based options serve as a reliable alternative for those who follow vegan or vegetarian diets or have allergies. Yasmin Karachiwala's recommendations reflect a wider shift toward simple, clean and easy-to-digest nutrition that supports fitness goals effectively.

The World Cup-winning captain will be in Hyderabad after the Kolkata leg -- the first of his tour. He will then proceed to Mumbai and New Delhi where he is expected to meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi. ""Thanks for all the love from India! The GOAT tour kicks off in a few weeks' time!!! I'm happy to share that Hyderabad has been added to my visits to Kolkata, Mumbai and Delhi. See you soon India!"" Messi posted on his social media handle. A post shared by Leo Messi (@leomessi) The decision to add Hyderabad came in the wake of the cancellation of Argentina's proposed friendly in Kochi, which had been originally announced by Kerala Sports Minister V Abdurahiman for November 17. The revised plan ensured that Messi's 'GOAT Tour' would span all the four corners of India -- east (Kolkata), south (Hyderabad), west (Mumbai) and north (New Delhi). Satadru Dutta, the sole organiser of the 'GOAT Tour to India 2025', had told PTI that Messi's event in Hyderabad will be held either at Gachibowli or Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium. According to Dutta, there would be a celebrity match, football clinic, felicitation and musical programme in Hyderabad. The GOAT Tour, conceptualised by Dutta, will feature a mix of celebrity football matches, musical events, meet-and-greet sessions, masterclasses for children and felicitation ceremonies across four cities. Messi will start his tour in Kolkata on December 13, followed by Hyderabad the same evening, before travelling to Mumbai on December 14 and concluding in New Delhi on December 15.

The police have detained three juveniles in connection with the murder and launched further investigation. According to the police, they received information on Thursday from a hospital in Rohini about the teenager, who was brought with stab injuries and was declared dead. A police team reached the hospital and later inspected the crime scene. ""During the inquiry, the team recorded the statement of the cousin of the teen, who is also a juvenile.

https://sports.ndtv.com/formula-1/lando-norris-staying-calm-with-formula-1-title-in-his-sights-at-qatar-gp-9717041,Lando Norris Staying Calm With Formula 1 Title In His Sights At Qatar GP,Associated Press,"Lando Norris has a big enough lead not to panic heading into the penultimate race of the Formula 1 season in Qatar on Sunday. The McLaren driver is close to sealing the first F1 title of his career. The 26-year-old Briton is 24 points ahead of teammate Oscar Piastri and Red Bull's Max Verstappen, whose brilliant comeback in recent weeks has given him a glimpse of a fifth straight crown. Verstappen's 69 race wins put him third all-time behind Michael Schumacher (91) and Lewis Hamilton (105). The dynamic Dutchman is already considered one of the best F1 drivers ever and his late charge this season was aided by the disqualification of both McLaren drivers following the Las Vegas GP last Sunday, a race he won. Norris lost the 18 points he had earned from crossing the line in second place, and Piastri the 12 from initially placing fourth. ""Of course it hurts. But actually I found it quite easy just to move on,"" said Norris, who earlier this season found himself lagging behind a dominant Piastri. ""I feel as relaxed as I was before, when I was 35 points behind (Piastri), and I feel the same when I'm 24 points ahead. That's my strength for now."" There are 33 points on offer this weekend, with an additional eight from Saturday's sprint race. Put more simply: Norris will clinch the Formula 1 title if he scores at least two more points than Verstappen and Piastri across the weekend. Race strategy will be harder to impose given that teams have two mandatory pit stops in Qatar, a measure imposed on safety grounds due to high risk of tire degradation at the 5.4-kilometer (3.35-mile) Lusail International Circuit. Pirelli tires are restricted to a maximum 25 laps in the 57-lap race. McLaren's penalty in Vegas hurt Norris, who had won the two previous races, more than Piastri. He inadvertently closed the gap on Norris, having finished six points behind him in that race before the DQ. But Piastri has not won since the final day of August at the Dutch Grand Prix and has no podiums in the past six races. ""There's still a chance,"" the Australian driver said. ""I also know that it's a bit of an outside shot."" Verstappen has won the last two races in Qatar and four of the last five in Abu Dhabi, where the season will end the following Sunday. His chances are boosted by a sprint race in Qatar, even if it's a mini-format he generally does not like. ""Ready. See what happens,"" he said. ""Yes, it is closer (than expected). Ideally I would have loved to have had it even more close. All in, and hopefully we can make it exciting to the end."" The race weekend began with a practice session in the afternoon followed by sprint qualifying in the early evening. After the Las Vegas race, the FIA summoned McLaren to race stewards for failing inspection. They deemed that the measured thickness on the skid wear - the wear on the protective plank on the underside of the cars - failed to meet the minimum requirements on both cars. Norris went from 30 points up on Piastri and 42 up on Verstappen to 24 up on both rivals (390-366). Piastri holds the tie-breaker for second in the standings based on his win total compared to Verstappen (7-6). Ferrari needs a strong finish to the season after being on the receiving end of criticism from executive chairman John Elkann. Hamilton has struggled this season and the seven-time F1 champion's performances have been below expectations. ""I feel terrible. Terrible,"" Hamilton said after Las Vegas, where he recorded his worst-ever qualifying performance by finishing 20th. ""No matter how much I try, it just keeps getting worse,"" he said. Aside from clinching a sprint race in China in March, the 40-year-old Briton has not won for Ferrari. Overall, he has won only two F1 races in four seasons including this one. His frustration has at times been expressed in curt message exchanges over the team radio with Ferrari race engineer Ricciardo Adami, with Hamilton sarcastically telling him to ""have a tea break while you're at it"" during the Miami GP in May. Hamilton was urged by team principal Frédéric Vasseur to ""calm down and be focused on the next two races"" and the driver has since said that his post-race comments in Vegas were made ""in the heat of frustration."" Charles Leclerc has not won a race this season, either, having won three with Ferrari in 2024. But the driver from Monaco leads Hamilton 7-0 in podiums and comfortably in the standings. Leclerc is fifth with 226 points, while his teammate is sixth with 152, only 15 points ahead of Kimi Antonelli, his 19-year-old replacement at Mercedes.

""The confluence of stable inflation, sustained public capex, and reform momentum positions the economy to navigate risks, as reflected in upward revisions to FY26 GDP growth projections by various agencies,"" the CEA told reporters at a press conference in New Delhi.

However, GDP data released on Friday showed manufacturing and services activity expanded sharply compared to last year due to higher private consumption and investment. A government statement said improving price dynamics and tax reforms are expected to boost household disposable incomes, strengthening the near-term consumption outlook. Moreover, healthy corporate sector balance sheets augur well for sustained private investments in the remaining half of FY26.

https://www.ndtv.com/education/3-idiots-fame-ladakh-school-gets-cbse-affiliation-over-two-decades-after-its-inception-8274041,'3 Idiots' Fame Ladakh School Gets CBSE Affiliation Over Two Decades After Its Inception,"Apr 28, 2025 08:57 am IST","Druk Padma Karpo School, nestled in the cold desert of Ladakh and popularly known as ""Rancho's school"", has finally got CBSE affiliation more than two decades after it was founded. The affiliation was granted after several delays and rejections.
The school, which shot to fame after it featured in the Aamir Khan-starrer movie ""3 Idiots"" in 2009, was so far affiliated with the Jammu and Kashmir State Board of School Education (JKBOSE). Known for its innovative methods of teaching much before the new National Education Policy (NEP) proposed reforms to move away from traditional ""rot learning"", the school is now planning to expand till class 12.
""We have finally got the CBSE affiliation after delay of several years and our first batch of class 10 students is now waiting for their CBSE board exam results.
""Though we had all the required infrastructure in place, excellent result record and focus on innovative ways of teaching and learning, we didn't get the NOC from the JKBOSE despite several attempts all these years,"" school principal Mingur Angmo told PTI.
As per the affiliation norms of the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE), schools require a 'no objection certificate' from the respective state board. The foreign schools require a similar document from the embassy concerned or the Consulate of India in the country concerned.
The school has been trying to get the clearance since even before Ladakh acquired the Union Territory status.
""The infrastructure is already being expanded and we plan to start class 11 and 12 by 2028. We are conducting some training for our teachers to facilitate a smooth transition for students to the CBSE curriculum. Our methods of teaching were different from traditional classroom teaching and with the CBSE also reforming its pedagogy after the NEP, it will be easier for us to blend both,"" Angmo explained.
Even after the bifurcation, several schools in Ladakh continue to be affiliated to the Jammu and Kashmir board.
A committee had also proposed establishment of a new territorial board in Ladakh with an aim to fulfil the ""realistic needs of the students as per the natural conditions of the region"".

The 24-year-old school is named after Mipham Pema Karpo (1527-1592), who is revered as a great scholar, while Padma Karpo means 'White Lotus' in Bothi, the local language.
The school is now flocked by tourists, making it a 'must go' point on the itinerary. A wall of the school's building featured in the closing scene of the Bollywood film in which one of the characters, Chatur, tries to urinate but gets an electric shock as two kids throw at him a light bulb connected with wire from the first floor's window.
While the 'iconic idiotic wall' - part of a building which was damaged in the 2010 flash floods - still remains on campus, the first floor, earlier made of bricks, has been replaced with wooden structures typically used in Ladakh.
The school decided in 2018 to relocate the 'Rancho's wall' to ensure students don't get distracted due to inflow of tourists.
""Now the two areas are separate, the students do not get disturbed by the tourists. However, at times tourists get to attend some activities ongoing at the school. Like yesterday, we had conducted mock elections with the election commission here. The activity was done to give students a first-hand experience of the democratic process right from voting to the forming of a government.
""So, if there is such an activity going on, we sometimes allow visitors to attend or see,"" Angmo explained.
""With CBSE affiliation, the transition for higher education in the country and abroad will be easier for our students and we can set an example of blending traditional classroom learning with innovative and play-way methods of teaching,"" she added. PTI GJS GJS MNK MNK

According to the Chief Education Officer (CEO), Rajouri, the decision was taken as a precautionary measure in response to the call for a shutdown, which was called by various associations and political parties in solidarity with the victims and condemnation of the Pahalgam terror attack, which claimed the lives of innocent tourists.

Meanwhile, as the nation comes to terms with the devastating loss, political parties as well as traders' unions in the region today have collectively called for a complete shutdown in the Kashmir valley in solidarity with the victims' families and condemnation of the attack.
Speaking to ANI on the complete shutdown in the valley, Bashir Ahmad Kongposh, General Secretary of the Kashmir Traders and Manufacturers Association, said that the complete shutdown was to show a strong condemnation and protest against the Pahalgam terror attack.
""Following the heart-wrenching incident that happened yesterday, the Kashmir traders and manufacturers association will be in complete shutdown today. We have protested against it and condemn this act as strongly as possible. Islam doesn't allow such things where people get killed... It is the death of humanity... We are really against these acts... Yesterday we had a meeting on the shutdown... We also want to keep these acts away from the region... In solidarity, we have called for a total shutdown in response to the attack,"" Kongposh said.
Business communities in Poonch also held protests, calling for a complete shutdown in response to the terror attack on Tuesday.
Earlier on Tuesday, several political parties in Jammu and Kashmir extended their support to the call for a Kashmir Bandh (shutdown) on Wednesday to condemn the Pahalgam terror attack and show solidarity with the victims' families.
Jammu and Kashmir National Conference (JKNC) has appealed to the people to make the Bandh a ""complete success"" and condemn the attack.
In a social media post on X, JKNC wrote, ""On the instruction of the Party President, JKNC joins the collective call for a bandh in strong condemnation of the Pahalgam terror attack. We appeal to the people of J&K to ensure the hartal called by religious and social leaders is a complete success.""
Jammu and Kashmir Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) chief Mehbooba Mufti has expressed solidarity with the victims' families and supported the shutdown, calling it an ""attack on all of us"".
Jammu-Kashmir Students Association (JKSA) has termed the attack an ""assault on the very soul of Jammu and Kashmir"" and has also extended its support to the Bandh.
All Parties Hurriyat Conference Chairman Mirwaiz Umar Farooq urged the people of Jammu and Kashmir to support the shutdown and peacefully protest against the ""heinous crime"".

FTII was set up by the Government of India in 1960, in the premises of the erstwhile Prabhat Studios in Pune. Formerly known as the 'Film Institute of India', it was a department of the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting.
In 1971, FTII came to be known as the 'Film and Television Institute of India' (FTII) and soon started in-service training programs for Doordarshan, India's public broadcaster. The Television Training wing, which was earlier functioning in New Delhi, shifted to Pune in 1974. Thereafter, the institute became fully aided by the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting.
In 2017, the Association of Indian Universities (AIU) had granted equivalence to six PG Diploma Programmes of the institute with Master's Degree.

Located in Kolkata and named after the legendary maestro Satyajit Ray, the Satyajit Ray Film and Television Institute was the second national centre of cinema education established in 1995 by the Government of India as an autonomous academic institution under the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting.
Presently, the Institute conducts three year postgraduate programmes in cinema in six specializations of film making and two year postgraduate programmes in Electronics and Digital Media in six specialisations.

According to a report by the American Immigration Lawyers Association (AILA), about half of the 327 recent visa revocations collected by the organisation have been of Indian students. The AILA brief, titled 'The Scope of Immigration Enforcement Actions Against International Students', highlights that 50 per cent of these students were from India, followed by 14 per cent from China. Other countries represented in the data include South Korea, Nepal, and Bangladesh.
The US State Department and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) have been screening foreign students' data, including their activism, over the past four months. Some allege that this screening is done usingartificial intelligence, which may lead to inaccurate targeting of students without a criminal history or links to campus protests. In March, Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced the ""Catch and Revoke"" program to identify and screen student visa holders, including monitoring their social media for evidence of anti-Semitism or support for Palestinians and Hamas.

The Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) is a portal used by the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to track international students and exchange program visitors. According to an ICE release, the visa status of 4,736 international students was terminated in the SEVIS system, mostly holding F1 visas. AILA described these administrative actions as unprecedented, raising several legal questions that may require litigation.
The impact of these visa revocations is significant, with 50 per cent of the 327 cases being Optional Practical Training (OPT) holders. OPT allows international students on F-1 visas to work in the US for up to 12 months. With their visas revoked, these students are now unable to work. The top states affected by these visa revocations are Texas, California, New York, Michigan, and Arizona.
However, its worthwhile to note that, around 1,000 international students at U.S. colleges, universities and university systems have had their visas revoked or their legal status terminated since late March, according to an Associated Press review of university statements and correspondence with school officials.
Many of the students losing their legal status are from India and China, which together account for more than half the international students at American colleges. But the terminations have not been limited to those from any one part of the world, lawyers said.
The Indian government has taken notice of the issue. Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal stated, ""We are aware that several Indian students have received communication from the US government regarding their F-1 visa status. We are looking into the matter. Our Embassy and consulate are in touch with the students.""",2025-05-03 05:01:14,education,Positive

The digital presence of candidates has become an extension of their personal brand and is as significant as formal documentation.
Advising students to be authentic and strategic with their social media account, Prashant A.Bhonsle, founder and CEO, Kuhoo Finance says, ""Celebrate your academic wins, cultural pride, and career goals, but avoid content that may be misunderstood across cultures. A balanced, thoughtful digital presence can reinforce your intent and become a quiet ally in your global education journey.""
""The digital world has become an extension of a candidate's resume,"" Mr Bhonsle adds. ""What you share online travels faster than your transcripts. Immigration officers now review social media as part of background checks. This way your posts can shape perceptions beyond borders.""
""Social media is no longer just personal,"" says Akshay Chaturvedi, founder and CEO of Leverage. ""It is a public narrative that can influence how anyone could perceive purpose of travel and mid-to-long-term goals. Students are hence now more conscious of maintaining a digital presence that reflects academic and professional goals without ambiguity. The political climate has made students more strategic, not just about what they study, but how they present themselves across all platforms.""
""Posts that highlight scholarly interests, research involvement, volunteer work, or creative projects can contribute positively to one's digital narrative,"" says Nandita Singh, manager - media labs (Growth), Athena Education.

https://www.ndtv.com/education/3-idiots-fame-ladakh-school-gets-cbse-affiliation-over-two-decades-after-its-inception-8274041,'3 Idiots' Fame Ladakh School Gets CBSE Affiliation Over Two Decades After Its Inception,"Apr 28, 2025 08:57 am IST","Druk Padma Karpo School, nestled in the cold desert of Ladakh and popularly known as ""Rancho's school"", has finally got CBSE affiliation more than two decades after it was founded. The affiliation was granted after several delays and rejections.
The school, which shot to fame after it featured in the Aamir Khan-starrer movie ""3 Idiots"" in 2009, was so far affiliated with the Jammu and Kashmir State Board of School Education (JKBOSE). Known for its innovative methods of teaching much before the new National Education Policy (NEP) proposed reforms to move away from traditional ""rot learning"", the school is now planning to expand till class 12.
""We have finally got the CBSE affiliation after delay of several years and our first batch of class 10 students is now waiting for their CBSE board exam results.
""Though we had all the required infrastructure in place, excellent result record and focus on innovative ways of teaching and learning, we didn't get the NOC from the JKBOSE despite several attempts all these years,"" school principal Mingur Angmo told PTI.
As per the affiliation norms of the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE), schools require a 'no objection certificate' from the respective state board. The foreign schools require a similar document from the embassy concerned or the Consulate of India in the country concerned.
The school has been trying to get the clearance since even before Ladakh acquired the Union Territory status.
""The infrastructure is already being expanded and we plan to start class 11 and 12 by 2028. We are conducting some training for our teachers to facilitate a smooth transition for students to the CBSE curriculum. Our methods of teaching were different from traditional classroom teaching and with the CBSE also reforming its pedagogy after the NEP, it will be easier for us to blend both,"" Angmo explained.
Even after the bifurcation, several schools in Ladakh continue to be affiliated to the Jammu and Kashmir board.
A committee had also proposed establishment of a new territorial board in Ladakh with an aim to fulfil the ""realistic needs of the students as per the natural conditions of the region"".

The 24-year-old school is named after Mipham Pema Karpo (1527-1592), who is revered as a great scholar, while Padma Karpo means 'White Lotus' in Bothi, the local language.
The school is now flocked by tourists, making it a 'must go' point on the itinerary. A wall of the school's building featured in the closing scene of the Bollywood film in which one of the characters, Chatur, tries to urinate but gets an electric shock as two kids throw at him a light bulb connected with wire from the first floor's window.
While the 'iconic idiotic wall' - part of a building which was damaged in the 2010 flash floods - still remains on campus, the first floor, earlier made of bricks, has been replaced with wooden structures typically used in Ladakh.
The school decided in 2018 to relocate the 'Rancho's wall' to ensure students don't get distracted due to inflow of tourists.
""Now the two areas are separate, the students do not get disturbed by the tourists. However, at times tourists get to attend some activities ongoing at the school. Like yesterday, we had conducted mock elections with the election commission here. The activity was done to give students a first-hand experience of the democratic process right from voting to the forming of a government.
""So, if there is such an activity going on, we sometimes allow visitors to attend or see,"" Angmo explained.
""With CBSE affiliation, the transition for higher education in the country and abroad will be easier for our students and we can set an example of blending traditional classroom learning with innovative and play-way methods of teaching,"" she added. PTI GJS GJS MNK MNK

According to the Chief Education Officer (CEO), Rajouri, the decision was taken as a precautionary measure in response to the call for a shutdown, which was called by various associations and political parties in solidarity with the victims and condemnation of the Pahalgam terror attack, which claimed the lives of innocent tourists.

Meanwhile, as the nation comes to terms with the devastating loss, political parties as well as traders' unions in the region today have collectively called for a complete shutdown in the Kashmir valley in solidarity with the victims' families and condemnation of the attack.
Speaking to ANI on the complete shutdown in the valley, Bashir Ahmad Kongposh, General Secretary of the Kashmir Traders and Manufacturers Association, said that the complete shutdown was to show a strong condemnation and protest against the Pahalgam terror attack.
""Following the heart-wrenching incident that happened yesterday, the Kashmir traders and manufacturers association will be in complete shutdown today. We have protested against it and condemn this act as strongly as possible. Islam doesn't allow such things where people get killed... It is the death of humanity... We are really against these acts... Yesterday we had a meeting on the shutdown... We also want to keep these acts away from the region... In solidarity, we have called for a total shutdown in response to the attack,"" Kongposh said.
Business communities in Poonch also held protests, calling for a complete shutdown in response to the terror attack on Tuesday.
Earlier on Tuesday, several political parties in Jammu and Kashmir extended their support to the call for a Kashmir Bandh (shutdown) on Wednesday to condemn the Pahalgam terror attack and show solidarity with the victims' families.
Jammu and Kashmir National Conference (JKNC) has appealed to the people to make the Bandh a ""complete success"" and condemn the attack.
In a social media post on X, JKNC wrote, ""On the instruction of the Party President, JKNC joins the collective call for a bandh in strong condemnation of the Pahalgam terror attack. We appeal to the people of J&K to ensure the hartal called by religious and social leaders is a complete success.""
Jammu and Kashmir Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) chief Mehbooba Mufti has expressed solidarity with the victims' families and supported the shutdown, calling it an ""attack on all of us"".
Jammu-Kashmir Students Association (JKSA) has termed the attack an ""assault on the very soul of Jammu and Kashmir"" and has also extended its support to the Bandh.
All Parties Hurriyat Conference Chairman Mirwaiz Umar Farooq urged the people of Jammu and Kashmir to support the shutdown and peacefully protest against the ""heinous crime"".

According to a report by the American Immigration Lawyers Association (AILA), about half of the 327 recent visa revocations collected by the organisation have been of Indian students. The AILA brief, titled 'The Scope of Immigration Enforcement Actions Against International Students', highlights that 50 per cent of these students were from India, followed by 14 per cent from China. Other countries represented in the data include South Korea, Nepal, and Bangladesh.
The US State Department and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) have been screening foreign students' data, including their activism, over the past four months. Some allege that this screening is done usingartificial intelligence, which may lead to inaccurate targeting of students without a criminal history or links to campus protests. In March, Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced the ""Catch and Revoke"" program to identify and screen student visa holders, including monitoring their social media for evidence of anti-Semitism or support for Palestinians and Hamas.

The Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) is a portal used by the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to track international students and exchange program visitors. According to an ICE release, the visa status of 4,736 international students was terminated in the SEVIS system, mostly holding F1 visas. AILA described these administrative actions as unprecedented, raising several legal questions that may require litigation.
The impact of these visa revocations is significant, with 50 per cent of the 327 cases being Optional Practical Training (OPT) holders. OPT allows international students on F-1 visas to work in the US for up to 12 months. With their visas revoked, these students are now unable to work. The top states affected by these visa revocations are Texas, California, New York, Michigan, and Arizona.
However, its worthwhile to note that, around 1,000 international students at U.S. colleges, universities and university systems have had their visas revoked or their legal status terminated since late March, according to an Associated Press review of university statements and correspondence with school officials.
Many of the students losing their legal status are from India and China, which together account for more than half the international students at American colleges. But the terminations have not been limited to those from any one part of the world, lawyers said.
The Indian government has taken notice of the issue. Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal stated, ""We are aware that several Indian students have received communication from the US government regarding their F-1 visa status. We are looking into the matter. Our Embassy and consulate are in touch with the students.""",2025-05-03 05:01:24,education,Positive

All students must report and enter their respective exam centres before 1.30pm.
The highly competitive test, which serves as a gateway to undergraduate medical courses at top government colleges, will be conducted at 5,453 centres across more than 500 cities nationwide.

Most exam centres this year have been set up in government and government-aided schools, colleges, universities, and other educational institutions.
To ensure smooth operations, mock drills were conducted at all test centres a day prior. These drills assessed readiness in terms of mobile signal jammer functionality, adequate deployment of frisking personnel, and proper functioning of biometric verification systems.
The Ministry of Education has warned that any student found engaging in malpractice-before, during, or after the examination-will face legal action under the Public Examinations (Prevention of Unfair Means) Act, 2024. Offenders will be penalised as per the provisions of the law.

These measures follow serious allegations of irregularities, including a reported paper leak during last year's NEET exam, which sparked nationwide concern over the integrity of the process.
In a major crackdown ahead of the 2025 test, the NTA has flagged 116 social media channels-including 106 on Telegram and 10 on Instagram-for allegedly spreading misinformation. The agency also launched a dedicated portal to gather leads on claims of paper leaks circulating online. More than 1,500 such claims have already been received and are under review.

These 5 Countries Offer Easiest And Fastest Student Visas,"May 04, 2025 12:39 pm IST","Study Abroad:As the number of Indian students heading abroad for higher education continues to rise, visa delays and high application costs in popular destinations such as US, UK, Canada, and Australia are prompting many to explore alternative options. Students are now turning to countries that not only offer affordable education but also have quicker and more accessible student visa processes.
Here's the list of five countries where obtaining a student visa is relatively easier and faster:
Poland
Poland is gaining popularity due to its affordable education, safe environment, and globally recognised universities. The visa process is simple and transparent, attracting more international applications. With a student visa acceptance rate of approximately 95 per cent, Poland stands out as one of the most accessible study destinations for Indian students.
Germany
Germany among the most sought-after destinations due to its high-quality education system and tuition-free policies at public universities. The country boasts a student visa acceptance rate of over 90 per cent. Students applying for STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics) programmes often find it even easier to secure a visa. Additionally, Germany offers an 18-month post-study work visa, allowing graduates to seek employment after completing their studies.
France
While not as widely chosen yet by Indian students, France is emerging as an attractive destination due to its streamlined visa process and high acceptance rate of around 85 per cent. The documentation required is minimal, and visa processing is relatively quicker. Popular study areas in France include business, hospitality, and fashion.

United Arab Emirates (UAE)
For students interested in management and business programmes, the UAE is becoming a preferred choice. The country usually processes student visas in under 30 days and offers long-term visas of up to five years for meritorious students. With an acceptance rate between 70 per cent and 80 per cent, and lower overall education costs, the UAE is gaining traction among Indian students.
Philippines
Ranked 11th among the most preferred study destinations for Indian students, the Philippines is especially known for its medical and healthcare-related programmes. In 2023 alone, nearly 9,700 Indian students enrolled in its institutions. The visa application process is simple, and tuition fees are significantly lower than those in Western countries.

All students must report and enter their respective exam centres before 1.30pm.
The highly competitive test, which serves as a gateway to undergraduate medical courses at top government colleges, will be conducted at 5,453 centres across more than 500 cities nationwide. A three-tier surveillance mechanism-at the district, state, and national levels-has been put in place to ensure the exam is held fairly.
Most exam centres this year have been set up in government and government-aided schools, colleges, universities, and other educational institutions.
To ensure smooth operations, mock drills were conducted at all test centres a day prior. These drills assessed readiness in terms of mobile signal jammer functionality, adequate deployment of frisking personnel, and proper functioning of biometric verification systems.
The Ministry of Education has warned that any student found engaging in malpractice-before, during, or after the examination-will face legal action under the Public Examinations (Prevention of Unfair Means) Act, 2024. Offenders will be penalised as per the provisions of the law.

These measures follow serious allegations of irregularities, including a reported paper leak during last year's NEET exam, which sparked nationwide concern over the integrity of the process.
In a major crackdown ahead of the 2025 test, the NTA has flagged 116 social media channels-including 106 on Telegram and 10 on Instagram-for allegedly spreading misinformation. The agency also launched a dedicated portal to gather leads on claims of paper leaks circulating online. More than 1,500 such claims have already been received and are under review.

Sectional movement will remain restricted, meaning candidates can proceed to the next section only once the allotted time has ended. PwD candidates will receive an additional 40 minutes.
Sharing insights on this year's Common Admission Test, Ram Kumar PN, Professor IIM Kozhikode and CAT 2025 Convenor says, ""There will be no significant structural differences between CAT 2025 and those of earlier years. The exam is designed to test the applicant's critical reasoning, analytical thinking, and problem-solving skills across all three sections, i.e., VARC, DILR, and QA.""
Students preparing for the exam should specifically account for logical reasoning, comprehension, and conceptual clarity, rather than relying on rote memorisation, adds Professor Kumar.
Talking about the preparation strategy for interviews, he adds, ""The preparation for the IIM interview rounds (which typically include the Personal Interview (PI) and the Written Ability Test (WAT)) must start immediately after the CAT exam, regardless of the applicant's score. These rounds carry significant weight, often between 30 per cent and 50 per cent of

the final selection score, making them critical for admission. The WAT assesses the candidate's written communication skills, clarity of thought, and ability to structure an argument under time pressure.""

https://www.ndtv.com/education/preparing-for-cambridge-university-undergraduate-interview-here-are-key-tips-straight-from-insiders-9714219,"Ahead Of Cambridge University Interviews, Experts Share Key Tips For Applicants","Nov 28, 2025 12:31 pm IST","With University of Cambridge's undergraduate interview season underway, students across the world are preparing for one of the most competitive admissions stages in higher education. But those who have sat on both sides of the process say the real ""secret"" to performing well is far simpler than most imagine. Admissions tutors, liaison officers and current students stress that Cambridge interviews are not designed to trip applicants up, but to understand how they think, how they respond to new ideas, and how they engage with unfamiliar material under gentle academic pressure.
Current Cambridge students and admissions professionals offered a wide range of advice to help applicants approach their interviews with confidence.
Ruby Cardie, a third-year law student at the University of Cambridge, said, ""The people interviewing you, they are just people as well. I tried to crack jokes for my interview. I tried to crack jokes for my interview. Did they necessarily land? No. But that doesn't matter. Just wear what you are comfortable in, they are not judging you on. How you look or where you come from, how you sound like. They just want to hear how you think.""
Emily Lawson-Todd, Schools Liaison Officer at St Catharine's College, emphasised that the interview is only one part of the process. ""The interview is only one part of a whole lot of things we use to judge and assess your application. It's not the be-all and end-all, even it feels like it is. So don't worry too much,"" she said.
Dr Marcus Tomalin, Director of Admissions at Trinity Hall, recommended simple, consistent practice with unfamiliar material.
""Any preparation for the interview, any practice for the interview, that involves the applicant, fairly frequently, you know, a few minutes, maybe each week looking at texts, they have never seen before and trying to make sense of them, and trying to interpret them, and explain and justify their interpretation of it. That's all going to be good practice. And again, I wouldn't suggest picking one text like that, and then analysing the same text again, and then the same, because again, that's how you become entrenched, make it a different text every time, so that you are always having to start from scratch every time.""
Dr Christopher Burlinson, Admissions Tutor at Jesus College, said students should focus on thinking rather than delivering rehearsed answers. ""We don't need long rehearsed speeches and we don't need you to agree with everything we say. We just need you to think.""

He added, ""So listen hard to what your interviewers ask you. Think hard about your response and don't worry if you have to change your mind, pause or ask for help. That shows us that you will be a good student.""
Ellie, Schools Liaison Officer at King's College, encouraged applicants not to panic if they face unfamiliar questions. ""Please also don't be afraid, if you don't know the answer to a question in an interview. There are going to be questions that you don't know. The answer to at first and that are designed to push you, you can absolutely ask for help or clarification from the interviewers to help guide you and give you a bit more context, and make sure to focus on what you do know. If there is an element of the question that you do understand or something that is familiar, you can talk about that and say, okay, so I understand this, but could you explain this a bit more or I might start from here and take it this way.""
Rossie, an HPSC student at Churchill College, said the key is to make your reasoning visible. ""Show your thought process. They are not kind of trying to trip you out. They just want to sort of see you the way you think. So explain what your thought process is, how you come to your decisions.""
Naomi Walker-Pearl, Deputy Admissions Tutor at Corpus Christi College, underlined that interviews are not memory tests.
""Some students might think that their interview will be a test of their A level or equivalent knowledge, that it's a bit of a memory test of school content. That's not the case at all. You might find that your interviewers might start off with something you have learnt at school. But quite quickly ask you to apply that knowledge to new situations and push you outside the school curriculum. And if you come out of your interview feeling like you have learnt something and you feel quite challenged, then I would say that there's a good chance that interview has gone quite well.""On presentation, a university official noted, ""There's no right way to look in your interview. You don't have to turn up in a suit, though you can if you want to. So just wear whatever makes you comfy and whatever you are going to feel good in on the day.""Ophelia, an HSPS student at Clare College, advised applicants to step back and relax before they enter the interview room.""Take maybe 15 minutes and half an hour before the interview just to chill out, have a cup of tea, stop looking over your notes and trust the process rather than stressing yourself out for no reason,"" she said.",2025-11-28 20:32:03,education,Positive

The exam is conducted for admission to various management programmes at IIMs and other management institutes. About three lakh candidates are expected to appear for the computer-based exam. Students who qualify in the entrance exam will have to appear in personal interview to secure a seat in the institute.
CAT 2025 will follow a two-hour format for non-PwD candidates, divided into three 40-minute sections-Verbal Ability and Reading Comprehension (VARC), Data Interpretation and Logical Reasoning (DILR) and Quantitative Ability (QA). Sectional movement will remain restricted, meaning candidates can proceed to the next section only once the allotted time has ended. PwD candidates will receive an additional 40 minutes.
Keeping in view the rising dependence of Artificial Intelligence and new age skills in the current workplace, the Indian Institutes of Management (IIM) have made several additions to their curriculum. Debashis Chatterjee, Director IIM Kozhikode explains, ""IIMs have significantly updated their curriculum to meet the needs of an AI-driven workplace and the transformation is both broad and deep. Across the IIM system, core courses have been refined to integrate advanced analytics, AI applications, and digital capabilities.

All subjects are important, but a few are tougher than others.
Physics, Chemistry, Legal Studies and Accountancy are considered the toughest exams among all. To ensure that the final exam does not come as a surprise, CBSE releases sample papers for all these subjects. Practising these sample papers also reduces exam anxiety and stress.
As everyone knows, Accountancy requires proper revision and concentration. To further reduce stress for students, CBSE has scheduled the Accountancy exam on February 24, 2026, right after Mass Media Studies, which is considered a relatively easy paper.
This year, the Accountancy exam will have 34 questions, and all of them will be compulsory. The question paper will be divided into two parts: A and B. Part A is compulsory for all candidates, while Part B is optional, students must attempt only one of the two options: (i) Analysis of Financial Statements or (ii) Computerised Accounting.

Accountancy is a highly scoring subject if you focus on accuracy, presentation, and practice. You can easily aim for 90+ with these proven strategies:
1. Master the Basics First:Chapters like Partnership Fundamentals and Company Accounts form the foundation. Practise journal entries daily small errors here cost heavy marks in longer questions.
2. Time Management:Allocate 1 hour for MCQs (quick scoring), 1 hour for short-answer questions and 1 hour for long-answer questions. Start with questions you are confident about to build momentum.
3. Workings are Key:Always show clear step-by-step workings for calculations. Even if the final answer is wrong, you can secure up to 50 per cent marks for correct steps.
4. Use Formats Religiously:Prepare Revaluation, Capital, Cash Flow, and other accounts in the exact CBSE-prescribed format with proper rulings and narrations - neat presentation fetches extra marks.
5. Practise Sample Papers & Previous Years:Solve the latest SQP and at least the last 10 years' papers in timed conditions.
6. Handle MCQs Smartly:Read the question and all options twice. Use the elimination method. In assertion-reasoning questions, check whether the reason correctly explains the assertion.
7. Part B Choice:Choose the option you are stronger in.
8. Revision Hacks:Create flashcards for formulas and ratios. Solve 2-3 full-length papers every week under exam conditions.",2025-11-28 20:32:12,education,Positive

For students planning to study abroad, choosing the right degree has become more important than ever. A new report from willrobotstakemyjob.com (WRTMJ), supported by course pricing data from IDP's database of over 2.5 lakh programmes, evaluates the automation risk, salary prospects and future demand across major occupations. Government labour statistics from Australia, the US, Canada and the UK also inform the study.
Healthcare Leads List Of AI-Safe Jobs
According to the report, the safest careers are those that require intensive human interaction and judgement-primarily in healthcare and medicine. These roles show near-zero automation risk, strong demand and high salaries, making them popular choices for international students.
Among undergraduate-level pathways, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, dentists, physicists, nurse midwives and physical therapists top the list. Physician assistants alone are expected to see 28.5 per cent job growth in the US by 2031, while nurse practitioner roles may rise by 46.3 per cent , one of the fastest expansions in the sector.
Despite the higher cost of studying medicine or dentistry, the payoff is significant: median annual US salaries range from 99,710 dollars for physical therapists to 2,36,000 dollars for urologists and rehabilitation physicians.

Top 10 Overall AI-Safe Jobs (Undergraduate Pathway)
(Key factors: median salary, growth outlook, cost, automation risk)
These roles dominate the highest scoring list due to excellent job prospects, minimal automation risk and strong earning potential.
High-Pay, High-Growth Jobs Requiring Postgraduate Study
The report also highlights careers that remain AI-proof but require postgraduate qualifications. Healthcare again leads with programmes in nursing practice, urology, anesthesiology, neurology, psychiatry, internal medicine and immunology.
Nurse practitioners rank highest, scoring 81.16, driven by rapid hiring needs and a median US salary of $126,260. Similarly, urologists and rehabilitation physicians maintain near-zero automation risk while averaging salaries above $230,000 annually.
Top AI-Safe Careers Requiring PG Degrees
Although postgraduate study increases costs-often adding $30,000 to $80,000-the long-term financial and job security benefits remain unmatched.
Human Skills Offer Biggest Shield Against AI
The report states that roles requiring empathy, complex decision-making and hands-on patient care are the least vulnerable to automation. For students eyeing international degrees, medicine, nursing, psychiatry, immunology and rehabilitation studies offer some of the safest and highest-reward pathways today.
With AI reshaping global workforces, degrees that combine human expertise with professional training are likely to remain in high demand-making healthcare the clear winner in the race for AI-proof careers.",2025-11-28 20:32:18,education,Positive

https://doctor.ndtv.com/living-healthy/is-kombucha-beneficial-for-your-gut-health-8313711,Is Kombucha Beneficial For Your Gut Health?,"Updated: May 2, 2025 07:13 IST","Kombucha, a fizzy fermented tea, has emerged as a popular health beverage across the globe. Touted as a natural probiotic, kombucha is often linked to improved digestion, better gut health, and even immune support. Made by fermenting sweetened tea with a symbiotic culture of bacteria and yeast (SCOBY), this ancient drink has been consumed for centuries. But does it really deliver on its health promises, especially for the gut? According to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and other studies, kombucha may play a supportive role in gut microbiome diversity. Let's explore the science behind this fermented favourite. Kombucha contains natural probiotics and bioactive compounds that may help balance gut bacteria and enhance digestion. During fermentation, beneficial bacteria and organic acids are produced, which can aid the gut microbiome. According to a review published in Frontiers in Microbiology, fermented foods like kombucha can positively influence gut flora, which is essential for nutrient absorption, immune function, and overall digestive well-being. With packed itineraries and limited access to clean facilities, hygiene can often take a back seat. Here are 7 essential hygiene tips to help you stay healthy and safe while travelling. Let's explore why eating a few tulsi leaves every day could be a powerful step toward holistic well-being. The fermentation process produces several strains of live beneficial bacteria, such as Lactobacillus and Acetobacter. These probiotics may help restore the balance of gut flora, especially after antibiotic use or poor dietary habits. A healthy gut microbiome is linked to better digestion, reduced inflammation, and even mental well-being. However, the quantity and strains vary by brand and brew method. Kombucha contains enzymes and organic acids like acetic acid and gluconic acid, which may assist in breaking down food more efficiently. Anecdotal evidence and some early studies suggest that regular consumption of kombucha may alleviate bloating, gas, and indigestion by supporting the body's natural digestive processes. Green or black tea, the base for kombucha, is rich in polyphenols and antioxidants. These compounds can protect the gut lining from oxidative stress and inflammation. Damage to the gut lining is often associated with leaky gut syndrome, food sensitivities, and autoimmune responses, making antioxidant support beneficial for long-term gut health. About 70% of your immune system resides in your gut. A healthy gut microbiome can help modulate immune responses. The probiotics in kombucha may help maintain this balance, reducing your susceptibility to infections and inflammatory responses. While more human clinical trials are needed, the existing data is promising. Gut dysbiosis, or an imbalance in gut microbes, has been linked to several conditions like irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), obesity, and even depression. Regular intake of fermented foods, including kombucha, may help prevent or correct such imbalances. A study in Nutrients (2021) reported that probiotic-rich foods could improve symptoms in individuals with mild digestive disorders. While kombucha is primarily known for probiotics, it may also contain small amounts of prebiotics depending on its ingredients. Prebiotics are plant fibres that feed good bacteria. Ingredients like ginger or fruit add-ins in kombucha may enhance this effect, offering additional gut support. Despite its benefits, kombucha is not suitable for everyone. Unpasteurised kombucha can pose a risk for pregnant women, individuals with weakened immune systems, or those sensitive to caffeine or alcohol. Additionally, many commercial versions contain added sugars, which can negate its health benefits. Always read labels and consult a healthcare provider, especially if you have pre-existing conditions. Kombucha offers potential gut health benefits, largely due to its probiotic content and natural fermentation. While more large-scale human studies are needed, current evidence supports its role as a gut-friendly beverage when consumed in moderation. For optimal results, pair kombucha with a fibre-rich diet and other fermented foods. As always, individual needs vary, consult a doctor before making it a daily habit.

https://doctor.ndtv.com/travel-and-health/7-hygiene-tips-to-keep-in-mind-while-travelling-8313687,7 Hygiene Tips To Keep In Mind While Travelling,"Updated: May 2, 2025 07:07 IST","Travelling opens up new experiences, but it can also expose you to unfamiliar germs and environments that may affect your health. Whether you're heading to a beach destination, trekking through the hills, or taking a business trip, maintaining personal hygiene is essential to prevent infections, digestive issues, and skin conditions. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), proper hand hygiene and safe food practices are critical during travel to avoid communicable diseases. With packed itineraries and limited access to clean facilities, hygiene can often take a back seat. Here are 7 essential hygiene tips to help you stay healthy and safe while travelling. Travelling brings increased contact with public surfaces, shared restrooms, and changing food habits, all of which can heighten your risk of infections. From traveller's diarrhoea to respiratory illnesses, poor hygiene can quickly turn a vacation into a visit to the clinic. Being mindful of basic hygiene practices ensures you stay energetic, confident, and illness-free throughout your journey. Let's explore the science behind this fermented favourite. Let's explore why eating a few tulsi leaves every day could be a powerful step toward holistic well-being. Keeping your hands clean is your first line of defence. Always carry an alcohol-based hand sanitiser (at least 60% alcohol) and use it after touching public surfaces, handling money, or before eating. The WHO strongly recommends hand hygiene, especially when soap and water are not available, common while travelling. Trains, flights, and hotel rooms may not always be as clean as they appear. Use disinfectant wipes to clean surfaces such as tray tables, armrests, remote controls, toilet seats, and doorknobs. This reduces the chance of picking up germs left behind by previous users. Your hands touch dozens of surfaces every hour, escalator railings, cab doors, menus, and then may unknowingly transfer germs to your eyes, nose, or mouth. Avoid face-touching as much as possible to reduce the risk of respiratory and skin infections. Food-borne illnesses are common among travellers. Opt for freshly cooked meals and avoid raw, undercooked, or street food if unsure about cleanliness. Drink only bottled or filtered water and avoid ice cubes unless you're certain they're made with purified water. The Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) also recommends avoiding tap water in unfamiliar areas. Public toilets can be unhygienic, especially in remote or high-traffic areas. Carry toilet seat sanitisers, tissue rolls, disposable seat covers, and hand sanitiser. For longer trips, consider including intimate wipes and feminine hygiene products if needed. Maintaining toilet hygiene helps prevent urinary tract infections (UTIs) and skin issues. Sweat and grime accumulate more quickly during travel, especially in humid or hot destinations. Pack clothes made of breathable fabrics like cotton and change them daily. Avoid re-wearing socks or undergarments, as doing so may cause skin irritation or fungal infections. A small laundry bag or detergent sachets can help you keep your garments fresh. Skipping brushing during hectic travel days is common but harmful. Always carry a compact dental kit with a toothbrush, paste, floss, and mouthwash. Good oral hygiene not only prevents bad breath and cavities but also helps reduce the risk of infections that can spread through the bloodstream. Maintaining hygiene while travelling doesn't require complicated routines, it just needs awareness and a little preparation. By following simple yet effective practices, you can protect yourself from illnesses that might disrupt your journey. As travel resumes in full swing post-pandemic, personal hygiene is more crucial than ever. Stay cautious, stay clean, and enjoy a healthy, worry-free travel experience.

The Ministry of AYUSH and organisations like the World Health Organisation (WHO) recognise the role of traditional herbs like tulsi in preventive healthcare. Let's explore why eating a few tulsi leaves every day could be a powerful step toward holistic well-being. Tulsi leaves are packed with powerful antioxidants, essential oils, and bioactive compounds like eugenol, ursolic acid, and rosmarinic acid. These natural substances offer anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, and adaptogenic effects that can protect your body from various ailments. Consuming the leaves raw ensures maximum potency, as heat or processing may diminish their active components. Let's explore the science behind this fermented favourite. With packed itineraries and limited access to clean facilities, hygiene can often take a back seat. Here are 7 essential hygiene tips to help you stay healthy and safe while travelling. Raw tulsi leaves strengthen the immune system by enhancing the body's ability to fight infections. They stimulate the production of antibodies and have natural antibacterial, antifungal, and antiviral properties. This makes them particularly helpful during seasonal changes or flu outbreaks. Regular consumption can reduce the frequency and severity of colds and fevers. Tulsi acts as a natural decongestant and expectorant, making it effective against respiratory ailments like asthma, bronchitis, and sinusitis. Chewing raw tulsi leaves can help clear phlegm, reduce cough, and ease breathing. Its antimicrobial nature also helps in managing bacterial infections of the respiratory tract. Tulsi is classified as an adaptogen, a natural substance that helps the body cope with physical and emotional stress. According to a study published in the Journal of Ayurveda and Integrative Medicine, tulsi significantly lowers cortisol (the stress hormone) levels and improves mood stability. Chewing raw leaves may help relieve anxiety and promote mental clarity. The compounds in tulsi help balance stomach acids, support healthy gut flora, and relieve digestive issues like bloating, gas, and indigestion. Chewing raw tulsi leaves before or after meals may stimulate digestive enzymes and promote smoother digestion. Tulsi's antibacterial properties make it excellent for oral hygiene. Chewing the leaves can help reduce bad breath, gum infections, and mouth ulcers. It also offers protection against oral pathogens that cause plaque formation and tooth decay. Studies suggest that tulsi may help regulate blood glucose levels, making it beneficial for people with type 2 diabetes. According to research in the International Journal of Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics, tulsi can reduce fasting blood sugar and improve insulin sensitivity. Consuming raw leaves in the morning on an empty stomach may help manage sugar levels. Tulsi helps the body flush out toxins by supporting liver and kidney function. It also contains antioxidants that neutralise free radicals and reduce oxidative stress, promoting overall cellular health. Drinking water infused with raw tulsi leaves is a common detox remedy in many Indian households. Raw tulsi leaves are a natural powerhouse offering preventive and therapeutic health benefits. From boosting immunity and aiding digestion to reducing stress and balancing sugar levels, they support overall wellness without side effects. However, moderation is key, consuming 2-3 leaves daily is sufficient. For those seeking natural ways to enhance health, tulsi could be a small but mighty addition to your routine.

https://doctor.ndtv.com/living-healthy/natural-detox-remedies-for-smokers-and-alcoholics-8313618,Natural Detox Remedies For Smokers And Alcoholics,"Updated: May 2, 2025 07:18 IST","Tobacco and alcohol use are two of the most common lifestyle choices that negatively impact the body's vital organs, especially the liver, lungs, heart, and kidneys. While quitting is the best option, the recovery and detoxification process can be supported naturally. Detox doesn't mean extreme fasting or relying on fancy juices, it involves helping the body eliminate toxins through the right foods, hydration, herbs, and lifestyle changes. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), supporting the body's detoxification systems is essential in substance abuse recovery. Here's how smokers and alcohol users can naturally cleanse their systems and boost their overall health. Alcohol and nicotine leave behind a trail of toxins that accumulate in the liver, lungs, and bloodstream. Over time, these can impair organ function, reduce immunity, and increase the risk of chronic diseases. Natural detox methods can help clear these harmful substances, support organ regeneration, and replenish essential nutrients depleted by prolonged smoking and drinking. Let's explore the science behind this fermented favourite. With packed itineraries and limited access to clean facilities, hygiene can often take a back seat. Here are 7 essential hygiene tips to help you stay healthy and safe while travelling. Water is crucial for flushing out toxins. Aim for at least 8–10 glasses a day. You can also drink detoxifying liquids like lemon water, coconut water, or cucumber-infused water. For alcoholics, hydration helps rehydrate the body and supports liver function. Smokers benefit as water helps clear tar and toxins from the lungs. Alcohol and cigarette smoke deplete your body of essential antioxidants like vitamin C, E, and beta-carotene. Include berries, citrus fruits, spinach, beetroot, carrots, and tomatoes in your daily diet. These foods help combat oxidative stress and reduce inflammation caused by toxic exposure. Milk thistle is an age-old herbal remedy known to support liver health. The compound silymarin found in milk thistle has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties that help regenerate liver cells. It's especially beneficial for alcohol-related liver damage. Always consult a doctor before adding supplements to your routine. Smokers can benefit from regular steam inhalation with essential oils like eucalyptus or peppermint to clear lung congestion. Additionally, practicing breathing techniques like pranayama or deep diaphragmatic breathing can improve lung capacity and help expel residual toxins. Green tea is rich in catechins and other antioxidants that help boost liver function and remove toxins. Other herbal teas like dandelion root tea, ginger tea, or turmeric tea support digestion, reduce inflammation, and assist detox pathways. Alcohol irritates the gut lining and alters gut flora, while smoking impacts nutrient absorption. Eating fibre-rich foods like oats, whole grains, flaxseeds, and leafy greens can promote healthy bowel movements and support gut detoxification. A healthy gut also supports immunity and mood regulation. Physical activity increases circulation, boosts metabolism, and promotes sweating, a natural detox pathway. Cardio, brisk walking, or yoga help smokers improve lung function and support alcoholics in liver healing. According to the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), exercise also helps reduce cravings and improves mental health during recovery. Both smokers and alcohol consumers should reduce intake of processed foods, sugary snacks, and refined carbs. These stress the liver and gut and increase inflammation. Opt instead for clean, home-cooked meals rich in proteins, healthy fats, and whole grains. Quality sleep is the body's natural time for healing. Nicotine and alcohol often disturb sleep cycles, but focusing on 7-8 hours of rest per night helps repair tissues, reset hormones, and support cognitive function during detox. Detoxifying from alcohol and smoking requires patience, consistency, and lifestyle adjustments. While no remedy is a substitute for quitting, these natural strategies can accelerate the body's healing process and reduce the risk of long-term damage. Always consult a healthcare provider when planning a detox, especially if you're undergoing withdrawal or treatment. Your body deserves a fresh start, nourish it well.

https://doctor.ndtv.com/living-healthy/these-abnormalities-on-your-hands-suggest-these-health-concerns-8313464,These Abnormalities On Your Hands Suggest These Health Concerns,"Updated: May 2, 2025 06:24 IST","Abnormalities on your hands can sometimes suggest underlying health concerns because the skin, nails, joints, and circulation in your hands are closely linked to internal systems like cardiovascular, nervous, metabolic, and immune functions. Subtle changes in color, texture, swelling, or nail shape can be early indicators of conditions like nutrient deficiencies, thyroid disorders, liver disease, or even autoimmune issues. Since the hands are so vascular and visible, they often show signs of internal imbalances sooner than other parts of the body. In this article, we outline various abnormalities of the hands and what they might indicate to.   Consistently cold hands may indicate poor circulation, low thyroid function (hypothyroidism), or Raynaud's disease, a condition that affects blood flow. If your hands stay cold even in warm conditions, it's worth checking your blood pressure and thyroid levels.  Mild hand tremors could be caused by caffeine or stress, but persistent shaking might be linked to neurological issues like Parkinson's disease or essential tremor. It can also signal thyroid overactivity (hyperthyroidism).  When the tips of the fingers swell and nails curve downward, it may point to oxygen deprivation in the blood, often associated with lung diseases, heart conditions, or even liver issues.  Yellow nails might suggest fungal infections, chronic bronchitis, or lymphedema, while pale nails can indicate anaemia. Bluish nails could mean a lack of oxygen in the blood, possibly related to heart or lung disorders.  Swelling in the fingers that doesn't go away may be due to arthritis, kidney disease, or hormonal imbalances. Inflammation and fluid retention can both be signs of internal stress.  Persistent rashes on the hands can be due to eczema or psoriasis, but they might also be triggered by autoimmune diseases or allergic reactions to medications or foods.  Frequent peeling may signal vitamin B deficiency, especially B3 (niacin) or B7 (biotin), or even dehydration. It can also result from overexposure to harsh soaps and sanitisers, which compromise the skin barrier.  These sensations may suggest nerve compression, such as carpal tunnel syndrome, or more systemic issues like diabetes, which affects nerve health. It could also be a sign of vitamin B12 deficiency.  These could be harmless bruises from trauma, but if unexplained, a dark line under the nail could point to melanoma, a type of skin cancer. It's something that should be evaluated quickly.  A sudden decline in grip strength can be a sign of nerve problems, muscle wasting, or even early rheumatoid arthritis. It can also reflect overall decline in physical health, especially in older adults.  Paying attention to persistent or unusual changes in the hands can help in early detection and timely management of several health conditions.

https://doctor.ndtv.com/health-supplements/these-supplements-may-be-harming-your-kidneys-8310922,These Supplements May Be Harming Your Kidneys,"Updated: May 2, 2025 01:04 IST","Supplements can be harmful to the kidneys, especially when taken in excess or without proper medical guidance. The kidneys are responsible for filtering waste and toxins from the blood, and certain supplements can overburden this system, leading to damage or worsening existing kidney conditions. Some supplements contain substances that are directly toxic to the kidneys, while others can interfere with medications, alter fluid and electrolyte balance, or contribute to the formation of kidney stones. Read on as we share a list of supplements that might be harming your kidneys.   Vitamin D is essential for bone health and immune function, but excessive intake can raise calcium levels in the blood. This condition, called hypercalcemia, can strain the kidneys and lead to the formation of calcium-based kidney stones. Prolonged high calcium levels may also cause calcification in kidney tissues, impairing their function.  Common among athletes and bodybuilders, creatine is used to enhance muscle performance. However, high doses or prolonged use can stress the kidneys by increasing the amount of creatinine, a waste product that kidneys must filter. In people with existing kidney conditions, creatine can accelerate damage.  Protein is essential, but overconsumption especially through supplements can overwork the kidneys. Excess protein increases the nitrogen load in the blood, which the kidneys must excrete. This can lead to glomerular hyper-filtration and, over time, may contribute to kidney damage, especially in people with underlying kidney disease.  Willow bark and similar herbal supplements contain salicylates, similar to aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). These can reduce blood flow to the kidneys and interfere with their ability to regulate salt and water balance, potentially leading to acute kidney injury, especially when used frequently or in combination with dehydration.  While vitamin C is water-soluble and generally considered safe, large doses (over 2,000 mg/day) can increase oxalate production in the body. Oxalate can bind with calcium to form crystals, which may accumulate in the kidneys as stones. Chronic overuse of vitamin C supplements has been linked to oxalate nephropathy, a serious kidney condition.  Used for digestive issues and adrenal fatigue, licorice root contains glycyrrhizin, which can lead to elevated blood pressure and low potassium levels, a condition known as hypokalaemia. These effects can strain kidney function, especially in people with pre-existing heart or kidney conditions. Chronic use has been associated with fluid retention and electrolyte imbalances that impair renal health.  While magnesium is vital for muscle and nerve function, taking too much, especially in supplement form can be harmful, particularly in people with reduced kidney function. Healthy kidneys usually excrete excess magnesium, but when they are impaired, magnesium can accumulate in the body, causing symptoms like nausea, low blood pressure, and, in severe cases, kidney toxicity or even cardiac arrest.  Even healthy individuals may be at risk if they use high doses over a prolonged period or combine multiple supplements without supervision.

https://doctor.ndtv.com/nutrition/7-long-term-health-risks-of-ultra-processed-foods-8305993,7 Long-Term Health Risks Of Ultra-Processed Foods,"Updated: May 1, 2025 09:03 IST","Ultra-processed foods, those high in artificial additives, refined sugars, saturated fats, and preservatives, have become a convenient part of modern diets. From packaged snacks to sugary drinks, these foods are everywhere. However, the long-term health consequences are alarming. According to a 2023 report by the World Health Organisation (WHO), diets rich in ultra-processed foods are linked to a range of chronic conditions including obesity, type 2 diabetes, and heart disease. The issue isn't just about empty calories, it's about the chemical processing that strips food of its natural nutritional value and may harm your body over time. Here's what you need to know. Ultra-processed foods often contain high levels of sugar, unhealthy fats, sodium, and chemical additives that can disrupt metabolic health. They are designed for shelf life and taste, not nutrition. As per Harvard Health and WHO, consistent consumption of such foods can trigger inflammation, hormone imbalance, and poor gut health, increasing your risk of lifestyle diseases and even some cancers over time. Let's explore the science behind this fermented favourite. With packed itineraries and limited access to clean facilities, hygiene can often take a back seat. Here are 7 essential hygiene tips to help you stay healthy and safe while travelling. Ultra-processed foods are calorie-dense and nutrient-poor. They promote overeating due to their addictive combinations of sugar, salt, and fat. These foods also bypass normal satiety signals, leading to weight gain. A study published in Cell Metabolism (2019) found that people who ate ultra-processed foods consumed 500 more calories daily compared to those eating whole foods, significantly increasing their risk of obesity. The high glycemic index of ultra-processed foods spikes blood sugar levels rapidly. Over time, this can lead to insulin resistance and eventually type 2 diabetes. The British Medical Journal (BMJ) published findings indicating a 12% higher risk of diabetes among individuals who frequently consumed ultra-processed items, including sugary drinks, refined cereals, and packaged desserts. High sodium and trans fat content in ultra-processed foods can elevate blood pressure and cholesterol levels. This significantly increases the risk of cardiovascular diseases. The American Heart Association warns that even moderate consumption of these foods may contribute to arterial plaque buildup and hypertension, particularly in middle-aged adults. Emerging evidence links frequent intake of ultra-processed foods to an elevated cancer risk. A French study in The BMJ found that a 10% increase in ultra-processed food consumption was associated with a 12% higher risk of cancer. Additives like emulsifiers, nitrates, and artificial sweeteners may disrupt gut microbiota and promote carcinogenic activity. Ultra-processed foods are low in fibre and high in chemical additives that can damage the gut lining. They disturb the natural balance of healthy bacteria, leading to issues like bloating, constipation, or even inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). A healthy gut is vital for immune and mental health, and long-term exposure to these foods can compromise both. Research suggests a correlation between ultra-processed food consumption and mood disorders such as depression and anxiety. A study in Public Health Nutrition linked these diets with a 30% increase in the likelihood of experiencing depression. These foods lack essential nutrients like B-vitamins and omega-3 fatty acids, which support brain function. A large-scale Spanish cohort study concluded that those who consumed more than four servings of ultra-processed foods per day had a 62% higher risk of all-cause mortality. Regular intake of these foods affects multiple systems in the body, metabolic, cardiovascular, and immune, leading to accelerated aging and disease vulnerability. Ultra-processed foods may offer convenience, but the long-term health risks are far too significant to ignore. From metabolic dysfunction to increased cancer and mortality risks, their impact spans the entire body. Reducing intake and choosing whole, minimally processed foods can drastically improve overall health. As always, consult your doctor or a dietitian for personalised dietary guidance.

https://doctor.ndtv.com/sexual-health/5-tips-to-improve-your-reproductive-health-8305983,5 Tips To Improve Your Reproductive Health,"Updated: May 1, 2025 08:57 IST","Reproductive health is a crucial component of overall well-being, impacting not just fertility but hormonal balance, emotional stability, and quality of life. For both men and women, maintaining good reproductive health involves a combination of lifestyle choices, dietary habits, and regular medical check-ups. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), reproductive health addresses the proper functioning of reproductive organs, safe sex, and the ability to reproduce with dignity and confidence. Whether you're planning a family or just want to optimise your wellness, focusing on your reproductive health today can help prevent complications in the future. Reproductive health is not only about treating infertility, it's about prevention and holistic care. Small, sustainable lifestyle changes can significantly improve reproductive health and enhance fertility. Here are five essential tips that support better reproductive function. Let's explore the science behind this fermented favourite. With packed itineraries and limited access to clean facilities, hygiene can often take a back seat. Here are 7 essential hygiene tips to help you stay healthy and safe while travelling. A diet rich in antioxidants, vitamins, and minerals plays a vital role in hormone regulation and reproductive organ function. Nutrients like folic acid, zinc, omega-3 fatty acids, and vitamin D are especially important. a. For women Leafy greens, legumes, citrus fruits, and whole grains can support ovulation and hormonal balance. b. For men Foods like walnuts, tomatoes, and pumpkin seeds may improve sperm quality and motility. Avoid trans fats, highly processed foods, and excessive sugar, all of which can contribute to hormonal imbalances. Physical activity helps maintain a healthy weight, improve circulation, and reduce stress, all of which are key for reproductive health. Obesity is linked to hormonal disruption, ovulatory dysfunction in women, and low testosterone levels in men. a. Aim for 150 minutes of moderate exercise per week, such as walking, cycling, or yoga. b. Avoid excessive or intense training routines, as over-exercising may suppress reproductive hormones and reduce fertility. Practising safe sex protects against sexually transmitted infections (STIs), many of which can lead to infertility if untreated. The Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) highlights that infections like chlamydia and gonorrhoea often have no symptoms but can cause lasting damage. a. Use protection such as condoms during intercourse. b. Get tested regularly if you have multiple partners. c. Urinate after intercourse to prevent urinary tract infections (UTIs), which can affect reproductive organs. Chronic stress can interfere with the production of key reproductive hormones such as oestrogen, progesterone, and testosterone. Stress also affects libido and the ability to conceive. a. Practice mindfulness, meditation, or deep breathing exercises. b. Ensure adequate sleep (7-9 hours per night). c. Consider speaking to a therapist or counsellor if you feel overwhelmed or anxious. d. Reducing stress not only improves mood but also enhances reproductive hormone function and sexual health. Routine visits to a gynaecologist (for women) or andrologist/urologist (for men) help identify issues early. Fertility tests, hormone panels, and pelvic exams can catch concerns before they escalate. a. Women should get regular Pap smears, HPV tests, and monitor menstrual irregularities. b. Men can benefit from semen analysis and testosterone level assessments if facing fertility issues. c. Timely intervention can treat or reverse many causes of infertility and improve long-term reproductive health. Reproductive health is not just about reproduction, it's about maintaining hormonal balance, physical well-being, and emotional stability. By adopting a healthy lifestyle, being proactive with check-ups, and protecting against infections, both men and women can support their reproductive systems.

https://doctor.ndtv.com/ear/heres-what-your-earwax-reveals-about-health-8305945,Here's What Your Earwax Reveals About Health,"Updated: May 1, 2025 08:41 IST","Earwax, technically known as cerumen, might seem like an unpleasant byproduct of the body, but it serves several important functions. It traps dust, bacteria, and foreign particles, keeping the inner ear clean and protected. Surprisingly, its colour, texture, and amount can offer insights into your overall health. From infections to genetic markers, earwax may act as an early warning sign for certain conditions. According to the American Academy of Otolaryngology, earwax is a natural self-cleaning agent and a key indicator of ear health. Paying attention to changes in earwax could help detect potential issues before they become serious. Earwax isn't just about hygiene, it reflects what's happening inside your body. Variations in its colour, texture, or odour can point toward infections, stress, metabolic conditions, and even inherited traits. Understanding these subtle shifts can help you better monitor your ear and general health. Let's take a closer look at what different types of earwax may reveal. Let's explore the science behind this fermented favourite. With packed itineraries and limited access to clean facilities, hygiene can often take a back seat. Here are 7 essential hygiene tips to help you stay healthy and safe while travelling. One of the most basic distinctions in earwax is whether it's dry (grey and flaky) or wet (yellow to brown and sticky). This is determined by a single gene, ABCC11. Most East Asians have dry earwax, while people of African or European descent generally have the wet type. While this difference is harmless, it may also be associated with body odour tendencies. This is the most common colour and texture of earwax in children and young adults. It's sticky and traps debris efficiently. This type usually indicates a healthy, functioning ear canal. If you notice this and there are no symptoms like pain or hearing loss, there's likely no cause for concern. Dark-coloured earwax is often a sign of older cerumen that has collected dust or debris. However, very dark or black earwax can also be linked to oxidative stress, which may result from anxiety or environmental factors. Unless accompanied by discomfort or odour, it's generally harmless, but worth monitoring if it happens frequently. Earwax that appears white and flaky may suggest an underlying skin condition such as eczema or psoriasis, especially if there is associated itching or scaling near the ear canal. People with these conditions are also more prone to wax build-up and blockages. If your earwax is green or has a bad odour, it could indicate a bacterial infection in the ear canal. This may be accompanied by symptoms like pain, fluid discharge, or hearing issues. According to the National Institutes of Health (NIH), foul-smelling earwax is often an early sign of otitis externa or “swimmer's ear.” Thin, watery wax, especially if accompanied by popping sounds or ear pressure, may suggest fluid behind the eardrum, a symptom common in ear infections or sinus issues. This is particularly frequent in children and can impact hearing if untreated. If your earwax is tinged with blood, it might signal a scratch, ruptured eardrum, or even more serious issues like a tumour or chronic infection. The Mayo Clinic recommends consulting an ENT specialist if you notice blood in earwax, especially if paired with hearing loss or dizziness. Earwax is more than just an ear-cleaning mechanism, it can be a useful indicator of your inner health. By observing changes in texture, colour, and smell, you can detect early warning signs of infections, skin disorders, or even genetic traits. If in doubt, consult a medical professional rather than self-cleaning with cotton buds, which may worsen the issue.   Disclaimer: This content including advice provides generic information only.

https://doctor.ndtv.com/living-healthy/can-excessive-salt-intake-affect-your-mental-health-8305936,Can Excessive Salt Intake Affect Your Mental Health?,"Updated: May 1, 2025 09:06 IST","Salt is an essential part of our diet, helping maintain fluid balance, support nerve function, and regulate blood pressure. However, modern diets, particularly processed and packaged foods, have dramatically increased our daily salt intake beyond recommended levels. While excessive salt is widely known for contributing to high blood pressure and cardiovascular disease, recent studies have begun linking high sodium intake to mental health conditions. From increased anxiety to cognitive impairment, the effect of salt on the brain is becoming a growing concern. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), reducing salt intake is crucial not just for heart health, but for overall well-being. Your brain is highly sensitive to chemical changes in the body. Consuming too much salt may affect hormones, blood pressure, and inflammation, each of which can impact your mental health. Research is emerging that suggests a high-sodium diet could worsen symptoms of depression, anxiety, and even increase the risk of neurodegenerative diseases. Let's explore the science behind this fermented favourite. With packed itineraries and limited access to clean facilities, hygiene can often take a back seat. Here are 7 essential hygiene tips to help you stay healthy and safe while travelling. Excessive sodium has been linked to increased inflammation throughout the body, including the brain. A 2021 study published in Nature Neuroscience found that inflammation caused by high salt intake can impair neurons, especially in regions like the hippocampus that control mood and memory. Too much salt can lead to hypertension, which narrows blood vessels and restricts blood flow to the brain. Over time, this can cause cognitive decline, memory issues, and may even contribute to the development of dementia. The American Heart Association warns that uncontrolled blood pressure is a silent but significant contributor to brain damage. A high-salt diet can disrupt the gut microbiota, which in turn affects the gut-brain axis—a communication pathway between your digestive tract and brain. An imbalance in gut bacteria has been associated with increased anxiety and depressive symptoms. According to research from the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the gut microbiome plays a critical role in regulating mood and mental clarity. Salt influences the body's hormonal balance. A study from Hypertension journal showed that high sodium intake can increase cortisol levels, the body's primary stress hormone. Elevated cortisol has been linked with anxiety, irritability, and even depressive episodes. High salt consumption may lead to poor sleep quality, either by causing dehydration or increasing blood pressure overnight. Poor sleep is a well-known trigger for mental health issues, including irritability, low mood, and reduced concentration. Emerging research has shown that excessive salt intake could accelerate the risk of Alzheimer's disease. A 2020 study published in Cell suggested that high salt disrupts nitric oxide production, a compound essential for healthy blood vessels in the brain. Reduced nitric oxide impairs brain function and is associated with neurodegenerative conditions. People consuming high-sodium diets are more prone to experiencing mood fluctuations. Though the evidence is still evolving, studies from the Journal of Clinical Psychiatry note a possible correlation between high salt diets and an increased prevalence of depressive symptoms. While salt is vital in moderation, excessive intake poses serious risks beyond physical health, it can compromise brain function and mental well-being. Experts from the WHO recommend keeping salt intake under 5 grams per day. Reducing processed foods and choosing fresh, whole ingredients is a practical first step toward safeguarding both your heart and your mind.

https://doctor.ndtv.com/health-supplements/add-these-supplements-to-your-routine-as-the-weather-gets-hotter-8305930,Add These Supplements To Your Routine As The Weather Gets Hotter,"Updated: May 1, 2025 08:26 IST","Adding certain supplements during the summer can boost health by compensating for seasonal challenges like dehydration, fatigue, sun exposure, and nutrient loss due to sweating. As temperatures rise, the body's needs shift slightly, electrolyte balance becomes crucial, skin requires protection and repair, and energy levels can dip. Supplements can support hydration, enhance energy production, protect against oxidative stress from UV rays, and promote overall well-being when combined with a balanced diet and lifestyle. Read on as we share supplements to help you better manage your health this summer.   Increased sweating during summer can deplete essential electrolytes, leading to fatigue, dizziness, or muscle cramps. Supplementing with an electrolyte blend (especially one that includes sodium, potassium, and magnesium) helps maintain fluid balance, supports muscle function, and prevents dehydration. Look for sugar-free powders or tablets you can dissolve in water post-workout or after long hours in the sun.  Vitamin C is not only a powerful antioxidant but also supports collagen production, which is vital for skin repair after sun exposure. It helps protect against oxidative stress caused by UV rays and environmental pollutants. A daily supplement can strengthen immunity, reduce inflammation, and promote radiant skin during the summer months.  This fat-soluble antioxidant works alongside Vitamin C to protect skin cells from UV damage and oxidative stress. It also aids in repairing dry, sun-damaged skin. A typical supplement can support skin health, especially if you're spending more time outdoors.  Omega-3s help reduce inflammation, support heart health, and keep the skin hydrated and supple. Summer activities and sun exposure can dehydrate the skin and accelerate aging, and Omega-3s work to counteract this.  Digestive discomfort often increases in the summer due to travel, dietary changes, or heat-related food spoilage. Probiotic supplements support gut health, enhance nutrient absorption, and improve immunity.  Although summer brings more sunlight, many people still don't get enough Vitamin D due to sunscreen use or indoor lifestyles. Vitamin D supports bone health, immune function, and mood regulation. A supplement daily can ensure optimal levels, especially if you aren't spending long periods in direct sunlight.  Heat and physical activity can sap energy quickly, and B vitamins help convert food into energy and support stress management. A B-complex supplement boosts energy, enhances mood, and helps reduce fatigue, making it a great addition to your summer wellness kit.  Zinc helps regulate immune function, supports wound healing, and plays a role in reducing skin inflammation. It also helps the body adapt to stress and heat. A daily dose of 15–30 mg is generally safe and effective, especially during times of increased physical exertion or sun exposure.  Choosing the right summer-specific supplements can help you feel more energised, stay protected, and recover faster from heat-related stress. Add these supplements to your diet today to achieve these benefits.   Disclaimer: This content including advice provides generic information only.

While underlying medical conditions can contribute to fertility challenges, many women can improve their chances of conceiving by making intentional changes to their daily routines. Habits related to nutrition, stress management, sleep, physical activity, and exposure to environmental toxins all influence hormonal balance, ovulation, and overall reproductive health. Making healthy lifestyle choices can help increase your chances of conceiving. Keep reading as we share a list of habits you can adopt to boost your fertility.  In this article, we share tips that can help boost fertility in men during summer. Several studies suggest that day-to-day stress in women can lower the chances of getting pregnant.  Both being underweight and overweight can disrupt ovulation and hormone levels, which are essential for fertility. Excess fat can lead to higher oestrogen levels, while too little body fat can prevent menstruation altogether.  A diet rich in whole foods especially leafy greens, berries, whole grains, legumes, healthy fats, and lean proteins can provide essential nutrients like folate, iron, zinc, and antioxidants. These nutrients support hormone regulation, egg quality, and reduce inflammation, all of which are crucial for reproductive health.  Chronic stress can disrupt the delicate hormonal balance needed for ovulation and menstruation. Practices like yoga, meditation, deep breathing, or even hobbies and social time can help lower cortisol levels and create a more fertile internal environment.  High consumption of alcohol and caffeine has been linked to reduced fertility. While moderate caffeine (around 1 cup of coffee per day) is generally safe, limiting or avoiding alcohol altogether is advised for those trying to conceive, as it can interfere with hormone levels and egg quality.  Smoking harms reproductive health by accelerating egg loss and damaging the fallopian tubes. It also affects hormonal balance and may lead to early menopause. Avoiding all forms of tobacco and minimising exposure to secondhand smoke is vital for women trying to conceive.  Poor sleep affects hormone regulation, including the hormones responsible for ovulation. Aim for 7–9 hours of uninterrupted, restful sleep each night to support reproductive health and balance stress levels, both of which are key to fertility.  While regular physical activity helps maintain a healthy weight and reduce stress, overexercising can disrupt menstruation and ovulation. Moderate-intensity workouts like walking, swimming, or yoga are beneficial, while extreme endurance routines may harm fertility.  Understanding your menstrual cycle and recognising fertile windows can greatly increase the chance of conception. Using ovulation predictor kits, tracking basal body temperature, or paying attention to cervical mucus changes can help time intercourse more effectively.  Everyday chemicals found in plastics, cosmetics, cleaning products, and pesticides can act as endocrine disruptors. Reducing exposure to these by choosing natural or organic products and avoiding BPA-containing plastics can help protect hormonal balance and fertility.  Regular visits to a gynaecologist or fertility specialist can help catch and manage any medical issues like thyroid imbalances, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), or endometriosis that may impact fertility. Early detection and treatment are key to improving reproductive outcomes.  Adopting fertility-friendly habits can not only support natural conception but also enhance the effectiveness of medical fertility treatments.

Most of the time, mothers are worried about the well-being of their unborn child. However, too much stress can be harmful to both the mother and the baby. Pregnancy is a delicate phase that involves several physical, hormonal and psychological changes. A new study has revealed that stress during pregnancy can affect babies even before birth. The research has revealed that paternal stress can change small RNA molecules in the blood of newborns, especially in girls. Here's a guide to seven easily available biotin-rich foods that are beneficial and safe during pregnancy. Here we outline in detail the many benefits of exercising for seniors. Feeling stressed is common during pregnancy. High stress levels in pregnancy may contribute to several issues such as high blood pressure, which may increase the chance of preterm labor or low birth weight. Stress can also contribute to issues like preeclampsia, eclampsia, and fetal growth restriction. Studies also suggest that increased cortisol levels during pregnancy may increase cortisol levels in a fetus, increasing the risk of developmental issues. Emotional stress during pregnancy may also affect cognitive development and may lead to attention difficulties and behavioural problems in a child. 1. Practice relaxation techniques: Try deep breathing exercises, meditation, or yoga tailored for pregnancy. 2. Stay active: Gentle exercises are safe during pregnancy like walking. Staying physically active can help boost mood, reduce stress and also keep you fit during pregnancy. Always consult with your doctor to determine safe activities. 3.

https://doctor.ndtv.com/health-supplements/these-supplements-can-help-reduce-brain-fog-8296229,These Supplements Can Help Reduce Brain Fog,"Updated: Apr 30, 2025 06:16 IST","Brain fog is a non-medical term used to describe a state of mental fatigue or clouded thinking, where a person may struggle with concentration, memory, mental clarity, and alertness. It can feel like mental sluggishness or being “spaced out.” Causes of brain fog range from stress, poor diet, lack of sleep, hormonal imbalances, and sedentary lifestyle, to underlying conditions like hypothyroidism, inflammation, or nutrient deficiencies. Supplements can help reduce brain fog when it's linked to nutritional gaps, chronic inflammation, oxidative stress, or neurotransmitter imbalances. Keep reading as we list supplements you can add to your diet to reduce brain fog.   Omega-3s are essential fats found in fish oil that support brain structure and function. DHA, in particular, makes up a large portion of the brain's grey matter. These fats reduce inflammation, improve communication between brain cells, and are known to enhance memory and mood. People deficient in omega-3s often report mental fatigue, so supplementation can help restore clarity and focus.  Vitamin B12 is vital for energy production and nerve health. A deficiency can lead to fatigue, memory issues, and confusion, all classic symptoms of brain fog. Supplementing with B12 supports the production of neurotransmitters like serotonin and dopamine and helps maintain the protective sheath around nerves (myelin), which is essential for fast and clear communication between brain cells.  Found naturally in green tea, L-theanine promotes relaxation without sedation. It helps calm the mind, improve focus, and reduce mental clutter. When combined with caffeine, L-theanine can enhance attention and working memory while minimising the jitteriness caffeine sometimes causes. This makes it especially useful for managing stress-induced brain fog.  Ginkgo biloba enhances blood circulation to the brain, which helps deliver more oxygen and nutrients to brain tissues. This improved flow supports better concentration, mental sharpness, and memory retention. Ginkgo also has antioxidant properties that protect brain cells from oxidative stress, which is a key contributor to cognitive decline and fogginess.  Magnesium plays a role in over 300 enzymatic processes, including those related to brain and nervous system function. Low levels of magnesium can lead to irritability, anxiety, and poor concentration. Magnesium supplements, particularly magnesium threonate, have been shown to support synaptic plasticity and memory, helping clear brain fog caused by stress and sleep issues.  Acetyl-L-Carnitine also known as ALCAR supports energy production in brain cells by transporting fatty acids into mitochondria. It also helps produce acetylcholine, a key neurotransmitter involved in learning and memory. ALCAR has been shown to improve mental energy, clarity, and alertness, particularly in people experiencing fatigue or age-related cognitive decline.  Vitamin D plays a role in regulating mood, reducing inflammation, and supporting immune and brain health. Deficiency is often linked to depression, fatigue, and cognitive issues. Supplementing with vitamin D, especially in those who get little sunlight, can help lift brain fog by enhancing mood-regulating chemicals and reducing inflammatory responses in the brain.  Supplements work by supporting brain function, improving blood flow, reducing inflammation, and enhancing the production of essential brain chemicals. Add them to your routine today to boost health.   Disclaimer: This content including advice provides generic information only. It is in no way a substitute for a qualified medical opinion.

https://doctor.ndtv.com/children/what-is-parasomnia-in-children-8295944,What Is Parasomnia In Children?,"Updated: Apr 30, 2025 06:09 IST","Sleep plays a vital role in a child's physical and mental development. However, certain sleep disorders like parasomnia can interrupt this essential rest. Parasomnia refers to unusual behaviours or experiences during sleep, including sleepwalking, night terrors, talking during sleep, or waking up confused. These disturbances, though often harmless, can be alarming for parents and caregivers. According to the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM), parasomnias are more prevalent in children than adults and usually occur during transitions between sleep stages. Early awareness and management can ensure better sleep hygiene and reduce risks associated with parasomnias in growing children. Parasomnias in children are typically classified into non-REM (NREM) and REM-related disorders. They can range from mild to severe, and while most children outgrow them, persistent symptoms may need medical attention. Here are the common types of parasomnias in children. Let's explore the science behind this fermented favourite. With packed itineraries and limited access to clean facilities, hygiene can often take a back seat. Here are 7 essential hygiene tips to help you stay healthy and safe while travelling. One of the most well-known parasomnias, sleepwalking involves a child moving around while still asleep. It usually occurs in deep NREM sleep and may involve aimless walking or attempts to leave the house. Safety precautions are essential. Unlike nightmares, night terrors cause a child to scream, sweat, and appear terrified, often with open eyes, but they won't be awake or responsive. These episodes typically occur early in the night and the child has no memory of them. Children experiencing this may wake up confused, disoriented, or upset. They might mumble or thrash around, but not be fully awake. These episodes usually happen during deep sleep and subside on their own. Common and usually harmless, sleep talking involves mumbling or even complete sentences during sleep. It's often triggered by stress, fever, or lack of sleep. Unlike night terrors, nightmares occur during REM sleep and are vividly remembered. If frequent, they may indicate emotional stress or trauma and can disrupt sleep quality. Although rare in children, sleep paralysis involves temporary inability to move or speak upon waking. It can be frightening but is usually harmless and linked to poor sleep cycles. Though often not classified strictly as parasomnia, persistent bedwetting in older children may coincide with other sleep disturbances and needs evaluation if it continues beyond the typical age. According to the National Sleep Foundation, common parasomnias include sleepwalking, night terrors, confusional arousals, and nightmares, often influenced by stress, fever, or irregular sleep schedules. A family history of parasomnias increases the likelihood in children. Irregular sleep routines and insufficient rest can trigger episodes. Emotional disturbances or trauma can contribute to nightmares and sleepwalking. High temperatures can increase the frequency of night terrors. Some drugs affecting the nervous system may induce parasomnias. Sudden noise or light changes during sleep can trigger abnormal sleep behaviours. Always consult a paediatrician if symptoms persist, worsen, or impact daytime functioning, early intervention can make all the difference in a child's wellbeing. Ensure regular bedtime and wake-up times. Avoid screens, loud noises, and caffeine before bed. These can reduce fear associated with night terrors or nightmares. Help children express emotions and reduce anxiety through play or therapy. Lock doors and windows, remove obstacles, and avoid bunk beds for sleepwalkers. If parasomnias are frequent or disruptive, a medical evaluation is advised. Parasomnia in children, while concerning for parents, is often a temporary phase that resolves with time and proper sleep hygiene. Understanding the types, triggers, and management strategies can provide reassurance and improve a child's sleep quality.

https://doctor.ndtv.com/living-healthy/7-common-triggers-of-migraine-in-summers-8295916,7 Common Triggers Of Migraine In Summers,"Updated: Apr 30, 2025 06:32 IST","For migraine sufferers, summer isn't always sunshine and happiness. Rising temperatures, intense humidity, and shifting routines can all become silent triggers. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO) and studies published by the American Migraine Foundation, environmental factors such as heat, dehydration, and bright light can exacerbate migraine episodes, particularly in warmer months. Understanding these seasonal triggers is essential for individuals who experience recurrent migraine attacks. By identifying and avoiding specific summer-related stimuli, people can reduce both the frequency and severity of migraines, leading to better control and an improved quality of life during the hottest months of the year. Summer heat can influence neurological and vascular systems, increasing the risk of migraines. Sudden weather changes, sun exposure, and poor hydration may lead to dilated blood vessels, a known contributor to migraines. According to the National Headache Foundation, these environmental factors often intensify the condition. Recognising these patterns is the first step toward prevention and effective migraine management. These are the most common triggers of migraine in summers. Let's explore the science behind this fermented favourite. With packed itineraries and limited access to clean facilities, hygiene can often take a back seat. Here are 7 essential hygiene tips to help you stay healthy and safe while travelling. Sweating more in the heat without replenishing fluids can lead to dehydration, a top migraine trigger. Even mild dehydration can cause headaches. Always carry water, and increase intake of fluids, especially when outdoors. Bright sunlight and high UV rays can overstimulate the brain's visual cortex. Prolonged exposure can lead to photophobia (light sensitivity) and trigger migraines. Sunglasses, wide-brimmed hats, and limiting time outdoors during peak hours are essential. High temperatures combined with humidity can cause your body to overheat, disturbing internal temperature regulation and increasing the risk of migraine. Stay in cool environments and use fans or air-conditioning to reduce impact. Summer routines often lead to irregular eating. Skipping meals causes blood sugar levels to drop, a common migraine trigger. Eat light but balanced meals every 3-4 hours to maintain energy and avoid crashes. Longer days can disrupt the body's sleep-wake cycle, especially if you're staying up late or waking earlier. Poor or irregular sleep is directly linked to migraine episodes. Aim for 7-9 hours of quality sleep daily. Cold coffees, sodas, and energy drinks may seem refreshing but often contain caffeine and sugar, both of which can aggravate migraines. Sudden intake or withdrawal from caffeine can also contribute to headaches. Summer often brings stronger odours, perfumes, sweat, pesticides, or chlorinated pool water, all of which can trigger migraines in sensitive individuals. Also, increased pollen and pollution can worsen sinus inflammation, another migraine pathway. Simple changes like staying hydrated, regulating sleep, and protecting yourself from extreme heat and sunlight go a long way. With vigilance and preventive care, those prone to migraines can enjoy a more comfortable and pain-free summer season. 1. Maintain a migraine diary to track specific seasonal triggers 2. Use cooling face towels and stay indoors during high-heat hours (12-4 pm) 3. Eat hydrating foods like cucumbers, watermelon, and yoghurt 4. Avoid sudden exposure to air conditioning after extreme heat 5. Keep sunglasses and an umbrella handy when outdoors 6. Limit screen time to avoid light-triggered headaches 7. Try relaxation techniques like meditation or breathing exercises to reduce stress While migraines can feel unpredictable, recognising and managing summer-specific triggers can make a substantial difference.

https://doctor.ndtv.com/diabetes/7-high-glycemic-foods-diabetics-should-avoid-8295895,7 High Glycemic Foods Diabetics Should Avoid,"Updated: Apr 30, 2025 06:22 IST","Managing diabetes effectively requires more than just medication, it hinges heavily on dietary choices. One of the most important factors in diabetic nutrition is the glycemic index (GI) of foods. The World Health Organisation (WHO) and the American Diabetes Association (ADA) both highlight the importance of avoiding high-GI foods, as they can cause rapid spikes in blood glucose levels. These foods are quickly broken down into sugar, which makes them risky for people with type 2 or type 1 diabetes. Being aware of high-GI foods and replacing them with healthier alternatives is key to keeping blood sugar levels stable and avoiding complications. The glycemic index ranks carbohydrates from 0 to 100 based on how fast they raise blood sugar. High-GI foods (above 70) cause sharp increases in glucose, leading to insulin spikes. Over time, this can worsen insulin resistance and increase the risk of complications. Monitoring GI can help diabetics maintain stable sugar levels and support long-term metabolic health. Here are mentioned 7 high glycemic foods diabetics should avoid. Let's explore the science behind this fermented favourite. With packed itineraries and limited access to clean facilities, hygiene can often take a back seat. Here are 7 essential hygiene tips to help you stay healthy and safe while travelling. Made from refined flour, white bread has a GI of around 75. It lacks fibre and nutrients, leading to a fast release of sugar into the bloodstream. Opt for wholegrain or multigrain bread instead. Cornflakes and puffed rice cereals may seem convenient, but they are among the highest GI foods (GI 80+). Choose high-fibre oats or unsweetened muesli to prevent sugar spikes after breakfast. Polished white rice, especially when overcooked, has a GI above 70. It can significantly raise post-meal glucose levels. Brown rice, quinoa, or millets like bajra or jowar are much healthier alternatives for Indian diets. Potatoes have a naturally high starch content. Mashed potatoes, with a GI of 85 or more, are especially problematic. Sweet potatoes or boiled potatoes in moderation with fibre-rich meals may be safer. These are loaded with added sugars and lack fibre, causing an immediate sugar surge. Their GI is often above 75. Diabetics should stick to water, unsweetened herbal teas, or diluted fresh lemon water. Refined pasta is quickly digested and converted into glucose. It ranks high on the GI scale unless paired with fibre and protein. Whole wheat pasta or zucchini noodles offer better glycemic control. While nutritious, watermelon has a GI of 76. Though its glycemic load is moderate due to high water content, large servings can still cause a sugar spike. Limit portion size and balance with protein. Replacing these items with low-GI, nutrient-rich alternatives is a simple yet powerful step toward better health and a more balanced lifestyle. 1. Combine high GI items with protein or fibre to slow glucose absorption. 2. Avoid cooking starchy foods for too long, as this increases their GI. 3. Use the “plate method”: half veggies, one-quarter protein, and one-quarter whole grain. 4. Keep a food diary to track reactions to specific foods. Understanding and managing the glycemic index of your diet is crucial for diabetes care. By avoiding or limiting these high-GI foods, diabetics can maintain more consistent blood sugar levels and reduce the risk of long-term complications.

https://doctor.ndtv.com/living-healthy/is-kombucha-beneficial-for-your-gut-health-8313711,Is Kombucha Beneficial For Your Gut Health?,"Updated: May 2, 2025 07:13 IST","Kombucha, a fizzy fermented tea, has emerged as a popular health beverage across the globe. Touted as a natural probiotic, kombucha is often linked to improved digestion, better gut health, and even immune support. Made by fermenting sweetened tea with a symbiotic culture of bacteria and yeast (SCOBY), this ancient drink has been consumed for centuries. But does it really deliver on its health promises, especially for the gut? According to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and other studies, kombucha may play a supportive role in gut microbiome diversity. Let's explore the science behind this fermented favourite. Kombucha contains natural probiotics and bioactive compounds that may help balance gut bacteria and enhance digestion. During fermentation, beneficial bacteria and organic acids are produced, which can aid the gut microbiome. According to a review published in Frontiers in Microbiology, fermented foods like kombucha can positively influence gut flora, which is essential for nutrient absorption, immune function, and overall digestive well-being. With packed itineraries and limited access to clean facilities, hygiene can often take a back seat. Here are 7 essential hygiene tips to help you stay healthy and safe while travelling. Let's explore why eating a few tulsi leaves every day could be a powerful step toward holistic well-being. The fermentation process produces several strains of live beneficial bacteria, such as Lactobacillus and Acetobacter. These probiotics may help restore the balance of gut flora, especially after antibiotic use or poor dietary habits. A healthy gut microbiome is linked to better digestion, reduced inflammation, and even mental well-being. However, the quantity and strains vary by brand and brew method. Kombucha contains enzymes and organic acids like acetic acid and gluconic acid, which may assist in breaking down food more efficiently. Anecdotal evidence and some early studies suggest that regular consumption of kombucha may alleviate bloating, gas, and indigestion by supporting the body's natural digestive processes. Green or black tea, the base for kombucha, is rich in polyphenols and antioxidants. These compounds can protect the gut lining from oxidative stress and inflammation. Damage to the gut lining is often associated with leaky gut syndrome, food sensitivities, and autoimmune responses, making antioxidant support beneficial for long-term gut health. About 70% of your immune system resides in your gut. A healthy gut microbiome can help modulate immune responses. The probiotics in kombucha may help maintain this balance, reducing your susceptibility to infections and inflammatory responses. While more human clinical trials are needed, the existing data is promising. Gut dysbiosis, or an imbalance in gut microbes, has been linked to several conditions like irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), obesity, and even depression. Regular intake of fermented foods, including kombucha, may help prevent or correct such imbalances. A study in Nutrients (2021) reported that probiotic-rich foods could improve symptoms in individuals with mild digestive disorders. While kombucha is primarily known for probiotics, it may also contain small amounts of prebiotics depending on its ingredients. Prebiotics are plant fibres that feed good bacteria. Ingredients like ginger or fruit add-ins in kombucha may enhance this effect, offering additional gut support. Despite its benefits, kombucha is not suitable for everyone. Unpasteurised kombucha can pose a risk for pregnant women, individuals with weakened immune systems, or those sensitive to caffeine or alcohol. Additionally, many commercial versions contain added sugars, which can negate its health benefits. Always read labels and consult a healthcare provider, especially if you have pre-existing conditions. Kombucha offers potential gut health benefits, largely due to its probiotic content and natural fermentation. While more large-scale human studies are needed, current evidence supports its role as a gut-friendly beverage when consumed in moderation. For optimal results, pair kombucha with a fibre-rich diet and other fermented foods. As always, individual needs vary, consult a doctor before making it a daily habit.

Whether you're heading to a beach destination, trekking through the hills, or taking a business trip, maintaining personal hygiene is essential to prevent infections, digestive issues, and skin conditions. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), proper hand hygiene and safe food practices are critical during travel to avoid communicable diseases. With packed itineraries and limited access to clean facilities, hygiene can often take a back seat. Here are 7 essential hygiene tips to help you stay healthy and safe while travelling. Travelling brings increased contact with public surfaces, shared restrooms, and changing food habits, all of which can heighten your risk of infections. From traveller's diarrhoea to respiratory illnesses, poor hygiene can quickly turn a vacation into a visit to the clinic. Being mindful of basic hygiene practices ensures you stay energetic, confident, and illness-free throughout your journey. Let's explore the science behind this fermented favourite. Let's explore why eating a few tulsi leaves every day could be a powerful step toward holistic well-being. Keeping your hands clean is your first line of defence. Always carry an alcohol-based hand sanitiser (at least 60% alcohol) and use it after touching public surfaces, handling money, or before eating. The WHO strongly recommends hand hygiene, especially when soap and water are not available, common while travelling. Trains, flights, and hotel rooms may not always be as clean as they appear. Use disinfectant wipes to clean surfaces such as tray tables, armrests, remote controls, toilet seats, and doorknobs. This reduces the chance of picking up germs left behind by previous users. Your hands touch dozens of surfaces every hour, escalator railings, cab doors, menus, and then may unknowingly transfer germs to your eyes, nose, or mouth. Avoid face-touching as much as possible to reduce the risk of respiratory and skin infections. Food-borne illnesses are common among travellers. Opt for freshly cooked meals and avoid raw, undercooked, or street food if unsure about cleanliness. Drink only bottled or filtered water and avoid ice cubes unless you're certain they're made with purified water. The Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) also recommends avoiding tap water in unfamiliar areas. Public toilets can be unhygienic, especially in remote or high-traffic areas. Carry toilet seat sanitisers, tissue rolls, disposable seat covers, and hand sanitiser. For longer trips, consider including intimate wipes and feminine hygiene products if needed. Maintaining toilet hygiene helps prevent urinary tract infections (UTIs) and skin issues. Sweat and grime accumulate more quickly during travel, especially in humid or hot destinations. Pack clothes made of breathable fabrics like cotton and change them daily. Avoid re-wearing socks or undergarments, as doing so may cause skin irritation or fungal infections. A small laundry bag or detergent sachets can help you keep your garments fresh. Skipping brushing during hectic travel days is common but harmful. Always carry a compact dental kit with a toothbrush, paste, floss, and mouthwash. Good oral hygiene not only prevents bad breath and cavities but also helps reduce the risk of infections that can spread through the bloodstream. Maintaining hygiene while travelling doesn't require complicated routines, it just needs awareness and a little preparation. By following simple yet effective practices, you can protect yourself from illnesses that might disrupt your journey. As travel resumes in full swing post-pandemic, personal hygiene is more crucial than ever. Stay cautious, stay clean, and enjoy a healthy, worry-free travel experience.

For centuries, Ayurvedic medicine has revered tulsi for its therapeutic properties, and modern science now validates many of these claims. Consuming raw tulsi leaves regularly is believed to boost immunity, support respiratory health, improve digestion, and manage stress levels. The Ministry of AYUSH and organisations like the World Health Organisation (WHO) recognise the role of traditional herbs like tulsi in preventive healthcare. Let's explore why eating a few tulsi leaves every day could be a powerful step toward holistic well-being. Tulsi leaves are packed with powerful antioxidants, essential oils, and bioactive compounds like eugenol, ursolic acid, and rosmarinic acid. These natural substances offer anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, and adaptogenic effects that can protect your body from various ailments. Consuming the leaves raw ensures maximum potency, as heat or processing may diminish their active components. Let's explore the science behind this fermented favourite. With packed itineraries and limited access to clean facilities, hygiene can often take a back seat. Here are 7 essential hygiene tips to help you stay healthy and safe while travelling. Raw tulsi leaves strengthen the immune system by enhancing the body's ability to fight infections. They stimulate the production of antibodies and have natural antibacterial, antifungal, and antiviral properties. This makes them particularly helpful during seasonal changes or flu outbreaks. Regular consumption can reduce the frequency and severity of colds and fevers. Tulsi acts as a natural decongestant and expectorant, making it effective against respiratory ailments like asthma, bronchitis, and sinusitis. Chewing raw tulsi leaves can help clear phlegm, reduce cough, and ease breathing. Its antimicrobial nature also helps in managing bacterial infections of the respiratory tract. Tulsi is classified as an adaptogen, a natural substance that helps the body cope with physical and emotional stress. According to a study published in the Journal of Ayurveda and Integrative Medicine, tulsi significantly lowers cortisol (the stress hormone) levels and improves mood stability. Chewing raw leaves may help relieve anxiety and promote mental clarity. The compounds in tulsi help balance stomach acids, support healthy gut flora, and relieve digestive issues like bloating, gas, and indigestion. Chewing raw tulsi leaves before or after meals may stimulate digestive enzymes and promote smoother digestion. Tulsi's antibacterial properties make it excellent for oral hygiene. Chewing the leaves can help reduce bad breath, gum infections, and mouth ulcers. It also offers protection against oral pathogens that cause plaque formation and tooth decay. Studies suggest that tulsi may help regulate blood glucose levels, making it beneficial for people with type 2 diabetes. According to research in the International Journal of Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics, tulsi can reduce fasting blood sugar and improve insulin sensitivity. Consuming raw leaves in the morning on an empty stomach may help manage sugar levels. Tulsi helps the body flush out toxins by supporting liver and kidney function. It also contains antioxidants that neutralise free radicals and reduce oxidative stress, promoting overall cellular health. Drinking water infused with raw tulsi leaves is a common detox remedy in many Indian households. Raw tulsi leaves are a natural powerhouse offering preventive and therapeutic health benefits. From boosting immunity and aiding digestion to reducing stress and balancing sugar levels, they support overall wellness without side effects. However, moderation is key, consuming 2-3 leaves daily is sufficient. For those seeking natural ways to enhance health, tulsi could be a small but mighty addition to your routine.

https://doctor.ndtv.com/living-healthy/natural-detox-remedies-for-smokers-and-alcoholics-8313618,Natural Detox Remedies For Smokers And Alcoholics,"Updated: May 2, 2025 07:18 IST","Tobacco and alcohol use are two of the most common lifestyle choices that negatively impact the body's vital organs, especially the liver, lungs, heart, and kidneys. While quitting is the best option, the recovery and detoxification process can be supported naturally. Detox doesn't mean extreme fasting or relying on fancy juices, it involves helping the body eliminate toxins through the right foods, hydration, herbs, and lifestyle changes. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), supporting the body's detoxification systems is essential in substance abuse recovery. Here's how smokers and alcohol users can naturally cleanse their systems and boost their overall health. Alcohol and nicotine leave behind a trail of toxins that accumulate in the liver, lungs, and bloodstream. Over time, these can impair organ function, reduce immunity, and increase the risk of chronic diseases. Natural detox methods can help clear these harmful substances, support organ regeneration, and replenish essential nutrients depleted by prolonged smoking and drinking. Let's explore the science behind this fermented favourite. With packed itineraries and limited access to clean facilities, hygiene can often take a back seat. Here are 7 essential hygiene tips to help you stay healthy and safe while travelling. Water is crucial for flushing out toxins. Aim for at least 8–10 glasses a day. You can also drink detoxifying liquids like lemon water, coconut water, or cucumber-infused water. For alcoholics, hydration helps rehydrate the body and supports liver function. Smokers benefit as water helps clear tar and toxins from the lungs. Alcohol and cigarette smoke deplete your body of essential antioxidants like vitamin C, E, and beta-carotene. Include berries, citrus fruits, spinach, beetroot, carrots, and tomatoes in your daily diet. These foods help combat oxidative stress and reduce inflammation caused by toxic exposure. Milk thistle is an age-old herbal remedy known to support liver health. The compound silymarin found in milk thistle has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties that help regenerate liver cells. It's especially beneficial for alcohol-related liver damage. Always consult a doctor before adding supplements to your routine. Smokers can benefit from regular steam inhalation with essential oils like eucalyptus or peppermint to clear lung congestion. Additionally, practicing breathing techniques like pranayama or deep diaphragmatic breathing can improve lung capacity and help expel residual toxins. Green tea is rich in catechins and other antioxidants that help boost liver function and remove toxins. Other herbal teas like dandelion root tea, ginger tea, or turmeric tea support digestion, reduce inflammation, and assist detox pathways. Alcohol irritates the gut lining and alters gut flora, while smoking impacts nutrient absorption. Eating fibre-rich foods like oats, whole grains, flaxseeds, and leafy greens can promote healthy bowel movements and support gut detoxification. A healthy gut also supports immunity and mood regulation. Physical activity increases circulation, boosts metabolism, and promotes sweating, a natural detox pathway. Cardio, brisk walking, or yoga help smokers improve lung function and support alcoholics in liver healing. According to the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), exercise also helps reduce cravings and improves mental health during recovery. Both smokers and alcohol consumers should reduce intake of processed foods, sugary snacks, and refined carbs. These stress the liver and gut and increase inflammation. Opt instead for clean, home-cooked meals rich in proteins, healthy fats, and whole grains. Quality sleep is the body's natural time for healing. Nicotine and alcohol often disturb sleep cycles, but focusing on 7-8 hours of rest per night helps repair tissues, reset hormones, and support cognitive function during detox. Detoxifying from alcohol and smoking requires patience, consistency, and lifestyle adjustments. While no remedy is a substitute for quitting, these natural strategies can accelerate the body's healing process and reduce the risk of long-term damage. Always consult a healthcare provider when planning a detox, especially if you're undergoing withdrawal or treatment. Your body deserves a fresh start, nourish it well.

https://doctor.ndtv.com/living-healthy/these-abnormalities-on-your-hands-suggest-these-health-concerns-8313464,These Abnormalities On Your Hands Suggest These Health Concerns,"Updated: May 2, 2025 06:24 IST","Abnormalities on your hands can sometimes suggest underlying health concerns because the skin, nails, joints, and circulation in your hands are closely linked to internal systems like cardiovascular, nervous, metabolic, and immune functions. Subtle changes in color, texture, swelling, or nail shape can be early indicators of conditions like nutrient deficiencies, thyroid disorders, liver disease, or even autoimmune issues. Since the hands are so vascular and visible, they often show signs of internal imbalances sooner than other parts of the body. In this article, we outline various abnormalities of the hands and what they might indicate to.   Consistently cold hands may indicate poor circulation, low thyroid function (hypothyroidism), or Raynaud's disease, a condition that affects blood flow. If your hands stay cold even in warm conditions, it's worth checking your blood pressure and thyroid levels.  Mild hand tremors could be caused by caffeine or stress, but persistent shaking might be linked to neurological issues like Parkinson's disease or essential tremor. It can also signal thyroid overactivity (hyperthyroidism).  When the tips of the fingers swell and nails curve downward, it may point to oxygen deprivation in the blood, often associated with lung diseases, heart conditions, or even liver issues.  Yellow nails might suggest fungal infections, chronic bronchitis, or lymphedema, while pale nails can indicate anaemia. Bluish nails could mean a lack of oxygen in the blood, possibly related to heart or lung disorders.  Swelling in the fingers that doesn't go away may be due to arthritis, kidney disease, or hormonal imbalances. Inflammation and fluid retention can both be signs of internal stress.  Persistent rashes on the hands can be due to eczema or psoriasis, but they might also be triggered by autoimmune diseases or allergic reactions to medications or foods.  Frequent peeling may signal vitamin B deficiency, especially B3 (niacin) or B7 (biotin), or even dehydration. It can also result from overexposure to harsh soaps and sanitisers, which compromise the skin barrier.  These sensations may suggest nerve compression, such as carpal tunnel syndrome, or more systemic issues like diabetes, which affects nerve health. It could also be a sign of vitamin B12 deficiency.  These could be harmless bruises from trauma, but if unexplained, a dark line under the nail could point to melanoma, a type of skin cancer. It's something that should be evaluated quickly.  A sudden decline in grip strength can be a sign of nerve problems, muscle wasting, or even early rheumatoid arthritis. It can also reflect overall decline in physical health, especially in older adults.  Paying attention to persistent or unusual changes in the hands can help in early detection and timely management of several health conditions.

https://doctor.ndtv.com/health-supplements/these-supplements-may-be-harming-your-kidneys-8310922,These Supplements May Be Harming Your Kidneys,"Updated: May 2, 2025 01:04 IST","Supplements can be harmful to the kidneys, especially when taken in excess or without proper medical guidance. The kidneys are responsible for filtering waste and toxins from the blood, and certain supplements can overburden this system, leading to damage or worsening existing kidney conditions. Some supplements contain substances that are directly toxic to the kidneys, while others can interfere with medications, alter fluid and electrolyte balance, or contribute to the formation of kidney stones. Read on as we share a list of supplements that might be harming your kidneys.   Vitamin D is essential for bone health and immune function, but excessive intake can raise calcium levels in the blood. This condition, called hypercalcemia, can strain the kidneys and lead to the formation of calcium-based kidney stones. Prolonged high calcium levels may also cause calcification in kidney tissues, impairing their function.  Common among athletes and bodybuilders, creatine is used to enhance muscle performance. However, high doses or prolonged use can stress the kidneys by increasing the amount of creatinine, a waste product that kidneys must filter. In people with existing kidney conditions, creatine can accelerate damage.  Protein is essential, but overconsumption especially through supplements can overwork the kidneys. Excess protein increases the nitrogen load in the blood, which the kidneys must excrete. This can lead to glomerular hyper-filtration and, over time, may contribute to kidney damage, especially in people with underlying kidney disease.  Willow bark and similar herbal supplements contain salicylates, similar to aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). These can reduce blood flow to the kidneys and interfere with their ability to regulate salt and water balance, potentially leading to acute kidney injury, especially when used frequently or in combination with dehydration.  While vitamin C is water-soluble and generally considered safe, large doses (over 2,000 mg/day) can increase oxalate production in the body. Oxalate can bind with calcium to form crystals, which may accumulate in the kidneys as stones. Chronic overuse of vitamin C supplements has been linked to oxalate nephropathy, a serious kidney condition.  Used for digestive issues and adrenal fatigue, licorice root contains glycyrrhizin, which can lead to elevated blood pressure and low potassium levels, a condition known as hypokalaemia. These effects can strain kidney function, especially in people with pre-existing heart or kidney conditions. Chronic use has been associated with fluid retention and electrolyte imbalances that impair renal health.  While magnesium is vital for muscle and nerve function, taking too much, especially in supplement form can be harmful, particularly in people with reduced kidney function. Healthy kidneys usually excrete excess magnesium, but when they are impaired, magnesium can accumulate in the body, causing symptoms like nausea, low blood pressure, and, in severe cases, kidney toxicity or even cardiac arrest.  Even healthy individuals may be at risk if they use high doses over a prolonged period or combine multiple supplements without supervision.

https://doctor.ndtv.com/nutrition/7-long-term-health-risks-of-ultra-processed-foods-8305993,7 Long-Term Health Risks Of Ultra-Processed Foods,"Updated: May 1, 2025 09:03 IST","Ultra-processed foods, those high in artificial additives, refined sugars, saturated fats, and preservatives, have become a convenient part of modern diets. From packaged snacks to sugary drinks, these foods are everywhere. However, the long-term health consequences are alarming. According to a 2023 report by the World Health Organisation (WHO), diets rich in ultra-processed foods are linked to a range of chronic conditions including obesity, type 2 diabetes, and heart disease. The issue isn't just about empty calories, it's about the chemical processing that strips food of its natural nutritional value and may harm your body over time. Here's what you need to know. Ultra-processed foods often contain high levels of sugar, unhealthy fats, sodium, and chemical additives that can disrupt metabolic health. They are designed for shelf life and taste, not nutrition. As per Harvard Health and WHO, consistent consumption of such foods can trigger inflammation, hormone imbalance, and poor gut health, increasing your risk of lifestyle diseases and even some cancers over time. Let's explore the science behind this fermented favourite. With packed itineraries and limited access to clean facilities, hygiene can often take a back seat. Here are 7 essential hygiene tips to help you stay healthy and safe while travelling. Ultra-processed foods are calorie-dense and nutrient-poor. They promote overeating due to their addictive combinations of sugar, salt, and fat. These foods also bypass normal satiety signals, leading to weight gain. A study published in Cell Metabolism (2019) found that people who ate ultra-processed foods consumed 500 more calories daily compared to those eating whole foods, significantly increasing their risk of obesity. The high glycemic index of ultra-processed foods spikes blood sugar levels rapidly. Over time, this can lead to insulin resistance and eventually type 2 diabetes. The British Medical Journal (BMJ) published findings indicating a 12% higher risk of diabetes among individuals who frequently consumed ultra-processed items, including sugary drinks, refined cereals, and packaged desserts. High sodium and trans fat content in ultra-processed foods can elevate blood pressure and cholesterol levels. This significantly increases the risk of cardiovascular diseases. The American Heart Association warns that even moderate consumption of these foods may contribute to arterial plaque buildup and hypertension, particularly in middle-aged adults. Emerging evidence links frequent intake of ultra-processed foods to an elevated cancer risk. A French study in The BMJ found that a 10% increase in ultra-processed food consumption was associated with a 12% higher risk of cancer. Additives like emulsifiers, nitrates, and artificial sweeteners may disrupt gut microbiota and promote carcinogenic activity. Ultra-processed foods are low in fibre and high in chemical additives that can damage the gut lining. They disturb the natural balance of healthy bacteria, leading to issues like bloating, constipation, or even inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). A healthy gut is vital for immune and mental health, and long-term exposure to these foods can compromise both. Research suggests a correlation between ultra-processed food consumption and mood disorders such as depression and anxiety. A study in Public Health Nutrition linked these diets with a 30% increase in the likelihood of experiencing depression. These foods lack essential nutrients like B-vitamins and omega-3 fatty acids, which support brain function. A large-scale Spanish cohort study concluded that those who consumed more than four servings of ultra-processed foods per day had a 62% higher risk of all-cause mortality. Regular intake of these foods affects multiple systems in the body, metabolic, cardiovascular, and immune, leading to accelerated aging and disease vulnerability. Ultra-processed foods may offer convenience, but the long-term health risks are far too significant to ignore. From metabolic dysfunction to increased cancer and mortality risks, their impact spans the entire body. Reducing intake and choosing whole, minimally processed foods can drastically improve overall health. As always, consult your doctor or a dietitian for personalised dietary guidance.

https://doctor.ndtv.com/sexual-health/5-tips-to-improve-your-reproductive-health-8305983,5 Tips To Improve Your Reproductive Health,"Updated: May 1, 2025 08:57 IST","Reproductive health is a crucial component of overall well-being, impacting not just fertility but hormonal balance, emotional stability, and quality of life. For both men and women, maintaining good reproductive health involves a combination of lifestyle choices, dietary habits, and regular medical check-ups. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), reproductive health addresses the proper functioning of reproductive organs, safe sex, and the ability to reproduce with dignity and confidence. Whether you're planning a family or just want to optimise your wellness, focusing on your reproductive health today can help prevent complications in the future. Reproductive health is not only about treating infertility, it's about prevention and holistic care. Small, sustainable lifestyle changes can significantly improve reproductive health and enhance fertility. Here are five essential tips that support better reproductive function. Let's explore the science behind this fermented favourite. With packed itineraries and limited access to clean facilities, hygiene can often take a back seat. Here are 7 essential hygiene tips to help you stay healthy and safe while travelling. A diet rich in antioxidants, vitamins, and minerals plays a vital role in hormone regulation and reproductive organ function. Nutrients like folic acid, zinc, omega-3 fatty acids, and vitamin D are especially important. a. For women Leafy greens, legumes, citrus fruits, and whole grains can support ovulation and hormonal balance. b. For men Foods like walnuts, tomatoes, and pumpkin seeds may improve sperm quality and motility. Avoid trans fats, highly processed foods, and excessive sugar, all of which can contribute to hormonal imbalances. Physical activity helps maintain a healthy weight, improve circulation, and reduce stress, all of which are key for reproductive health. Obesity is linked to hormonal disruption, ovulatory dysfunction in women, and low testosterone levels in men. a. Aim for 150 minutes of moderate exercise per week, such as walking, cycling, or yoga. b. Avoid excessive or intense training routines, as over-exercising may suppress reproductive hormones and reduce fertility. Practising safe sex protects against sexually transmitted infections (STIs), many of which can lead to infertility if untreated. The Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) highlights that infections like chlamydia and gonorrhoea often have no symptoms but can cause lasting damage. a. Use protection such as condoms during intercourse. b. Get tested regularly if you have multiple partners. c. Urinate after intercourse to prevent urinary tract infections (UTIs), which can affect reproductive organs. Chronic stress can interfere with the production of key reproductive hormones such as oestrogen, progesterone, and testosterone. Stress also affects libido and the ability to conceive. a. Practice mindfulness, meditation, or deep breathing exercises. b. Ensure adequate sleep (7-9 hours per night). c. Consider speaking to a therapist or counsellor if you feel overwhelmed or anxious. d. Reducing stress not only improves mood but also enhances reproductive hormone function and sexual health. Routine visits to a gynaecologist (for women) or andrologist/urologist (for men) help identify issues early. Fertility tests, hormone panels, and pelvic exams can catch concerns before they escalate. a. Women should get regular Pap smears, HPV tests, and monitor menstrual irregularities. b. Men can benefit from semen analysis and testosterone level assessments if facing fertility issues. c. Timely intervention can treat or reverse many causes of infertility and improve long-term reproductive health. Reproductive health is not just about reproduction, it's about maintaining hormonal balance, physical well-being, and emotional stability. By adopting a healthy lifestyle, being proactive with check-ups, and protecting against infections, both men and women can support their reproductive systems.

https://doctor.ndtv.com/ear/heres-what-your-earwax-reveals-about-health-8305945,Here's What Your Earwax Reveals About Health,"Updated: May 1, 2025 08:41 IST","Earwax, technically known as cerumen, might seem like an unpleasant byproduct of the body, but it serves several important functions. It traps dust, bacteria, and foreign particles, keeping the inner ear clean and protected. Surprisingly, its colour, texture, and amount can offer insights into your overall health. From infections to genetic markers, earwax may act as an early warning sign for certain conditions. According to the American Academy of Otolaryngology, earwax is a natural self-cleaning agent and a key indicator of ear health. Paying attention to changes in earwax could help detect potential issues before they become serious. Earwax isn't just about hygiene, it reflects what's happening inside your body. Variations in its colour, texture, or odour can point toward infections, stress, metabolic conditions, and even inherited traits. Understanding these subtle shifts can help you better monitor your ear and general health. Let's take a closer look at what different types of earwax may reveal. Let's explore the science behind this fermented favourite. With packed itineraries and limited access to clean facilities, hygiene can often take a back seat. Here are 7 essential hygiene tips to help you stay healthy and safe while travelling. One of the most basic distinctions in earwax is whether it's dry (grey and flaky) or wet (yellow to brown and sticky). This is determined by a single gene, ABCC11. Most East Asians have dry earwax, while people of African or European descent generally have the wet type. While this difference is harmless, it may also be associated with body odour tendencies. This is the most common colour and texture of earwax in children and young adults. It's sticky and traps debris efficiently. This type usually indicates a healthy, functioning ear canal. If you notice this and there are no symptoms like pain or hearing loss, there's likely no cause for concern. Dark-coloured earwax is often a sign of older cerumen that has collected dust or debris. However, very dark or black earwax can also be linked to oxidative stress, which may result from anxiety or environmental factors. Unless accompanied by discomfort or odour, it's generally harmless, but worth monitoring if it happens frequently. Earwax that appears white and flaky may suggest an underlying skin condition such as eczema or psoriasis, especially if there is associated itching or scaling near the ear canal. People with these conditions are also more prone to wax build-up and blockages. If your earwax is green or has a bad odour, it could indicate a bacterial infection in the ear canal. This may be accompanied by symptoms like pain, fluid discharge, or hearing issues. According to the National Institutes of Health (NIH), foul-smelling earwax is often an early sign of otitis externa or “swimmer's ear.” Thin, watery wax, especially if accompanied by popping sounds or ear pressure, may suggest fluid behind the eardrum, a symptom common in ear infections or sinus issues. This is particularly frequent in children and can impact hearing if untreated. If your earwax is tinged with blood, it might signal a scratch, ruptured eardrum, or even more serious issues like a tumour or chronic infection. The Mayo Clinic recommends consulting an ENT specialist if you notice blood in earwax, especially if paired with hearing loss or dizziness. Earwax is more than just an ear-cleaning mechanism, it can be a useful indicator of your inner health. By observing changes in texture, colour, and smell, you can detect early warning signs of infections, skin disorders, or even genetic traits. If in doubt, consult a medical professional rather than self-cleaning with cotton buds, which may worsen the issue.   Disclaimer: This content including advice provides generic information only.

https://doctor.ndtv.com/living-healthy/can-excessive-salt-intake-affect-your-mental-health-8305936,Can Excessive Salt Intake Affect Your Mental Health?,"Updated: May 1, 2025 09:06 IST","Salt is an essential part of our diet, helping maintain fluid balance, support nerve function, and regulate blood pressure. However, modern diets, particularly processed and packaged foods, have dramatically increased our daily salt intake beyond recommended levels. While excessive salt is widely known for contributing to high blood pressure and cardiovascular disease, recent studies have begun linking high sodium intake to mental health conditions. From increased anxiety to cognitive impairment, the effect of salt on the brain is becoming a growing concern. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), reducing salt intake is crucial not just for heart health, but for overall well-being. Your brain is highly sensitive to chemical changes in the body. Consuming too much salt may affect hormones, blood pressure, and inflammation, each of which can impact your mental health. Research is emerging that suggests a high-sodium diet could worsen symptoms of depression, anxiety, and even increase the risk of neurodegenerative diseases. Let's explore the science behind this fermented favourite. With packed itineraries and limited access to clean facilities, hygiene can often take a back seat. Here are 7 essential hygiene tips to help you stay healthy and safe while travelling. Excessive sodium has been linked to increased inflammation throughout the body, including the brain. A 2021 study published in Nature Neuroscience found that inflammation caused by high salt intake can impair neurons, especially in regions like the hippocampus that control mood and memory. Too much salt can lead to hypertension, which narrows blood vessels and restricts blood flow to the brain. Over time, this can cause cognitive decline, memory issues, and may even contribute to the development of dementia. The American Heart Association warns that uncontrolled blood pressure is a silent but significant contributor to brain damage. A high-salt diet can disrupt the gut microbiota, which in turn affects the gut-brain axis—a communication pathway between your digestive tract and brain. An imbalance in gut bacteria has been associated with increased anxiety and depressive symptoms. According to research from the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the gut microbiome plays a critical role in regulating mood and mental clarity. Salt influences the body's hormonal balance. A study from Hypertension journal showed that high sodium intake can increase cortisol levels, the body's primary stress hormone. Elevated cortisol has been linked with anxiety, irritability, and even depressive episodes. High salt consumption may lead to poor sleep quality, either by causing dehydration or increasing blood pressure overnight. Poor sleep is a well-known trigger for mental health issues, including irritability, low mood, and reduced concentration. Emerging research has shown that excessive salt intake could accelerate the risk of Alzheimer's disease. A 2020 study published in Cell suggested that high salt disrupts nitric oxide production, a compound essential for healthy blood vessels in the brain. Reduced nitric oxide impairs brain function and is associated with neurodegenerative conditions. People consuming high-sodium diets are more prone to experiencing mood fluctuations. Though the evidence is still evolving, studies from the Journal of Clinical Psychiatry note a possible correlation between high salt diets and an increased prevalence of depressive symptoms. While salt is vital in moderation, excessive intake poses serious risks beyond physical health, it can compromise brain function and mental well-being. Experts from the WHO recommend keeping salt intake under 5 grams per day. Reducing processed foods and choosing fresh, whole ingredients is a practical first step toward safeguarding both your heart and your mind.

https://doctor.ndtv.com/health-supplements/add-these-supplements-to-your-routine-as-the-weather-gets-hotter-8305930,Add These Supplements To Your Routine As The Weather Gets Hotter,"Updated: May 1, 2025 08:26 IST","Adding certain supplements during the summer can boost health by compensating for seasonal challenges like dehydration, fatigue, sun exposure, and nutrient loss due to sweating. As temperatures rise, the body's needs shift slightly, electrolyte balance becomes crucial, skin requires protection and repair, and energy levels can dip. Supplements can support hydration, enhance energy production, protect against oxidative stress from UV rays, and promote overall well-being when combined with a balanced diet and lifestyle. Read on as we share supplements to help you better manage your health this summer.   Increased sweating during summer can deplete essential electrolytes, leading to fatigue, dizziness, or muscle cramps. Supplementing with an electrolyte blend (especially one that includes sodium, potassium, and magnesium) helps maintain fluid balance, supports muscle function, and prevents dehydration. Look for sugar-free powders or tablets you can dissolve in water post-workout or after long hours in the sun.  Vitamin C is not only a powerful antioxidant but also supports collagen production, which is vital for skin repair after sun exposure. It helps protect against oxidative stress caused by UV rays and environmental pollutants. A daily supplement can strengthen immunity, reduce inflammation, and promote radiant skin during the summer months.  This fat-soluble antioxidant works alongside Vitamin C to protect skin cells from UV damage and oxidative stress. It also aids in repairing dry, sun-damaged skin. A typical supplement can support skin health, especially if you're spending more time outdoors.  Omega-3s help reduce inflammation, support heart health, and keep the skin hydrated and supple. Summer activities and sun exposure can dehydrate the skin and accelerate aging, and Omega-3s work to counteract this.  Digestive discomfort often increases in the summer due to travel, dietary changes, or heat-related food spoilage. Probiotic supplements support gut health, enhance nutrient absorption, and improve immunity.  Although summer brings more sunlight, many people still don't get enough Vitamin D due to sunscreen use or indoor lifestyles. Vitamin D supports bone health, immune function, and mood regulation. A supplement daily can ensure optimal levels, especially if you aren't spending long periods in direct sunlight.  Heat and physical activity can sap energy quickly, and B vitamins help convert food into energy and support stress management. A B-complex supplement boosts energy, enhances mood, and helps reduce fatigue, making it a great addition to your summer wellness kit.  Zinc helps regulate immune function, supports wound healing, and plays a role in reducing skin inflammation. It also helps the body adapt to stress and heat. A daily dose of 15–30 mg is generally safe and effective, especially during times of increased physical exertion or sun exposure.  Choosing the right summer-specific supplements can help you feel more energised, stay protected, and recover faster from heat-related stress. Add these supplements to your diet today to achieve these benefits.   Disclaimer: This content including advice provides generic information only.

https://doctor.ndtv.com/living-healthy/these-habits-can-be-beneficial-for-women-struggling-with-fertility-8302807,These Habits Can Be Beneficial For Women Struggling With Fertility,"Updated: May 1, 2025 01:41 IST","Lifestyle habits can be highly beneficial for fertility in women. While underlying medical conditions can contribute to fertility challenges, many women can improve their chances of conceiving by making intentional changes to their daily routines. Habits related to nutrition, stress management, sleep, physical activity, and exposure to environmental toxins all influence hormonal balance, ovulation, and overall reproductive health. Making healthy lifestyle choices can help increase your chances of conceiving. Keep reading as we share a list of habits you can adopt to boost your fertility.  In this article, we share tips that can help boost fertility in men during summer. Several studies suggest that day-to-day stress in women can lower the chances of getting pregnant.  Both being underweight and overweight can disrupt ovulation and hormone levels, which are essential for fertility. Excess fat can lead to higher oestrogen levels, while too little body fat can prevent menstruation altogether.  A diet rich in whole foods especially leafy greens, berries, whole grains, legumes, healthy fats, and lean proteins can provide essential nutrients like folate, iron, zinc, and antioxidants. These nutrients support hormone regulation, egg quality, and reduce inflammation, all of which are crucial for reproductive health.  Chronic stress can disrupt the delicate hormonal balance needed for ovulation and menstruation. Practices like yoga, meditation, deep breathing, or even hobbies and social time can help lower cortisol levels and create a more fertile internal environment.  High consumption of alcohol and caffeine has been linked to reduced fertility. While moderate caffeine (around 1 cup of coffee per day) is generally safe, limiting or avoiding alcohol altogether is advised for those trying to conceive, as it can interfere with hormone levels and egg quality.  Smoking harms reproductive health by accelerating egg loss and damaging the fallopian tubes. It also affects hormonal balance and may lead to early menopause. Avoiding all forms of tobacco and minimising exposure to secondhand smoke is vital for women trying to conceive.  Poor sleep affects hormone regulation, including the hormones responsible for ovulation. Aim for 7–9 hours of uninterrupted, restful sleep each night to support reproductive health and balance stress levels, both of which are key to fertility.  While regular physical activity helps maintain a healthy weight and reduce stress, overexercising can disrupt menstruation and ovulation. Moderate-intensity workouts like walking, swimming, or yoga are beneficial, while extreme endurance routines may harm fertility.  Understanding your menstrual cycle and recognising fertile windows can greatly increase the chance of conception. Using ovulation predictor kits, tracking basal body temperature, or paying attention to cervical mucus changes can help time intercourse more effectively.  Everyday chemicals found in plastics, cosmetics, cleaning products, and pesticides can act as endocrine disruptors. Reducing exposure to these by choosing natural or organic products and avoiding BPA-containing plastics can help protect hormonal balance and fertility.  Regular visits to a gynaecologist or fertility specialist can help catch and manage any medical issues like thyroid imbalances, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), or endometriosis that may impact fertility. Early detection and treatment are key to improving reproductive outcomes.  Adopting fertility-friendly habits can not only support natural conception but also enhance the effectiveness of medical fertility treatments.

Most of the time, mothers are worried about the well-being of their unborn child. However, too much stress can be harmful to both the mother and the baby. Pregnancy is a delicate phase that involves several physical, hormonal and psychological changes. A new study has revealed that stress during pregnancy can affect babies even before birth. The research has revealed that paternal stress can change small RNA molecules in the blood of newborns, especially in girls. Here's a guide to seven easily available biotin-rich foods that are beneficial and safe during pregnancy. Here we outline in detail the many benefits of exercising for seniors. Feeling stressed is common during pregnancy. High stress levels in pregnancy may contribute to several issues such as high blood pressure, which may increase the chance of preterm labor or low birth weight. Stress can also contribute to issues like preeclampsia, eclampsia, and fetal growth restriction. Studies also suggest that increased cortisol levels during pregnancy may increase cortisol levels in a fetus, increasing the risk of developmental issues. Emotional stress during pregnancy may also affect cognitive development and may lead to attention difficulties and behavioural problems in a child. 1. Practice relaxation techniques: Try deep breathing exercises, meditation, or yoga tailored for pregnancy. 2. Stay active: Gentle exercises are safe during pregnancy like walking. Staying physically active can help boost mood, reduce stress and also keep you fit during pregnancy. Always consult with your doctor to determine safe activities. 3. Prioritise self-care: Take time for yourself daily. Engage in activities like reading a book, taking a warm bath or any activity that you find enjoyable and relaxing. 4. Eat right: Proper nutrition helps promote healthy development of the baby and also supports mental well-being. Focus on consuming a well-balanced diet. 5. Limit caffeine and sugar: Excessive caffeine and sugar consumption can contribute to anxiety and may impact your sleep. 6. Seek professional help: If stress becomes overwhelming, consider consulting with a therapist or counsellor who specialises in pregnancy. Try these strategies and manage stress effectively during pregnancy. Disclaimer: This content including advice provides generic information only.

https://doctor.ndtv.com/health-supplements/these-supplements-can-help-reduce-brain-fog-8296229,These Supplements Can Help Reduce Brain Fog,"Updated: Apr 30, 2025 06:16 IST","Brain fog is a non-medical term used to describe a state of mental fatigue or clouded thinking, where a person may struggle with concentration, memory, mental clarity, and alertness. It can feel like mental sluggishness or being “spaced out.” Causes of brain fog range from stress, poor diet, lack of sleep, hormonal imbalances, and sedentary lifestyle, to underlying conditions like hypothyroidism, inflammation, or nutrient deficiencies. Supplements can help reduce brain fog when it's linked to nutritional gaps, chronic inflammation, oxidative stress, or neurotransmitter imbalances. Keep reading as we list supplements you can add to your diet to reduce brain fog.   Omega-3s are essential fats found in fish oil that support brain structure and function. DHA, in particular, makes up a large portion of the brain's grey matter. These fats reduce inflammation, improve communication between brain cells, and are known to enhance memory and mood. People deficient in omega-3s often report mental fatigue, so supplementation can help restore clarity and focus.  Vitamin B12 is vital for energy production and nerve health. A deficiency can lead to fatigue, memory issues, and confusion, all classic symptoms of brain fog. Supplementing with B12 supports the production of neurotransmitters like serotonin and dopamine and helps maintain the protective sheath around nerves (myelin), which is essential for fast and clear communication between brain cells.  Found naturally in green tea, L-theanine promotes relaxation without sedation. It helps calm the mind, improve focus, and reduce mental clutter. When combined with caffeine, L-theanine can enhance attention and working memory while minimising the jitteriness caffeine sometimes causes. This makes it especially useful for managing stress-induced brain fog.  Ginkgo biloba enhances blood circulation to the brain, which helps deliver more oxygen and nutrients to brain tissues. This improved flow supports better concentration, mental sharpness, and memory retention. Ginkgo also has antioxidant properties that protect brain cells from oxidative stress, which is a key contributor to cognitive decline and fogginess.  Magnesium plays a role in over 300 enzymatic processes, including those related to brain and nervous system function. Low levels of magnesium can lead to irritability, anxiety, and poor concentration. Magnesium supplements, particularly magnesium threonate, have been shown to support synaptic plasticity and memory, helping clear brain fog caused by stress and sleep issues.  Acetyl-L-Carnitine also known as ALCAR supports energy production in brain cells by transporting fatty acids into mitochondria. It also helps produce acetylcholine, a key neurotransmitter involved in learning and memory. ALCAR has been shown to improve mental energy, clarity, and alertness, particularly in people experiencing fatigue or age-related cognitive decline.  Vitamin D plays a role in regulating mood, reducing inflammation, and supporting immune and brain health. Deficiency is often linked to depression, fatigue, and cognitive issues. Supplementing with vitamin D, especially in those who get little sunlight, can help lift brain fog by enhancing mood-regulating chemicals and reducing inflammatory responses in the brain.  Supplements work by supporting brain function, improving blood flow, reducing inflammation, and enhancing the production of essential brain chemicals. Add them to your routine today to boost health.   Disclaimer: This content including advice provides generic information only. It is in no way a substitute for a qualified medical opinion.

https://doctor.ndtv.com/pregnancy/7-biotin-rich-foods-for-a-healthy-pregnancy-8295970,7 Biotin-Rich Foods For A Healthy Pregnancy,"Updated: Apr 30, 2025 08:17 IST","Biotin, also known as vitamin B7, is a water-soluble B-complex vitamin that plays a crucial role during pregnancy. It supports foetal development, enhances energy production, aids in metabolism, and helps maintain healthy skin, hair, and nails. According to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and World Health Organisation (WHO) guidelines, biotin deficiency during pregnancy can be more common than expected due to increased demand and changes in metabolism. Including biotin-rich foods in a prenatal diet can promote maternal and foetal health. Here's a guide to seven easily available biotin-rich foods that are beneficial and safe during pregnancy. Pregnancy increases the body's demand for essential nutrients, and biotin is no exception. It supports embryo development, helps convert food into energy, and plays a key role in forming enzymes necessary for cellular growth. Low biotin levels have been linked to birth defects in some studies. Hence, including biotin-rich foods is a natural way to support a healthy pregnancy. Try these 7 biotin-rich foods to include during pregnancy. Let's explore the science behind this fermented favourite. With packed itineraries and limited access to clean facilities, hygiene can often take a back seat. Here are 7 essential hygiene tips to help you stay healthy and safe while travelling. Egg yolks are one of the richest sources of biotin. Just one cooked egg yolk provides a good amount of this nutrient. Ensure eggs are fully cooked to avoid any risk of salmonella during pregnancy. Almonds, walnuts, sunflower seeds, and peanuts are not only rich in biotin but also contain healthy fats and protein. A small handful as a snack or sprinkled over salads can boost your biotin intake. Loaded with vitamins, fibre, and antioxidants, sweet potatoes also offer biotin. Their high vitamin A content also supports foetal eye and skin development, making them a pregnancy-friendly food. Bananas are rich in potassium and moderate in biotin, making them a great option for energy and nutrition. They're also easy on the stomach, helping with morning sickness or nausea during the first trimester. This leafy green is packed with iron, folate, and biotin, nutrients essential for pregnancy. Consuming lightly cooked spinach helps absorb the nutrients more effectively while reducing oxalate content. Whole wheat bread, oats, and brown rice contain moderate levels of biotin along with fibre, iron, and B-complex vitamins. Opting for whole grains ensures long-lasting energy and digestive health during pregnancy. Milk, yoghurt, and cheese offer not just calcium and protein but also a decent dose of biotin. These are great options for women who tolerate dairy well and are looking to diversify their sources. From supporting foetal development to maintaining maternal energy levels, it's vital to include biotin-rich foods in your daily diet. 1. Opt for fresh, whole foods over processed supplements when possible 2. Combine biotin-rich foods with other B vitamins for better absorption 3. Maintain a balanced, varied diet to meet all micronutrient needs 4. Always consult your doctor before starting any supplements Biotin is a key player in ensuring a smooth and healthy pregnancy journey. The best part? These foods are easily accessible and versatile.

https://doctor.ndtv.com/children/what-is-parasomnia-in-children-8295944,What Is Parasomnia In Children?,"Updated: Apr 30, 2025 06:09 IST","Sleep plays a vital role in a child's physical and mental development. However, certain sleep disorders like parasomnia can interrupt this essential rest. Parasomnia refers to unusual behaviours or experiences during sleep, including sleepwalking, night terrors, talking during sleep, or waking up confused. These disturbances, though often harmless, can be alarming for parents and caregivers. According to the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM), parasomnias are more prevalent in children than adults and usually occur during transitions between sleep stages. Early awareness and management can ensure better sleep hygiene and reduce risks associated with parasomnias in growing children. Parasomnias in children are typically classified into non-REM (NREM) and REM-related disorders. They can range from mild to severe, and while most children outgrow them, persistent symptoms may need medical attention. Here are the common types of parasomnias in children. Let's explore the science behind this fermented favourite. With packed itineraries and limited access to clean facilities, hygiene can often take a back seat. Here are 7 essential hygiene tips to help you stay healthy and safe while travelling. One of the most well-known parasomnias, sleepwalking involves a child moving around while still asleep. It usually occurs in deep NREM sleep and may involve aimless walking or attempts to leave the house. Safety precautions are essential. Unlike nightmares, night terrors cause a child to scream, sweat, and appear terrified, often with open eyes, but they won't be awake or responsive. These episodes typically occur early in the night and the child has no memory of them. Children experiencing this may wake up confused, disoriented, or upset. They might mumble or thrash around, but not be fully awake. These episodes usually happen during deep sleep and subside on their own. Common and usually harmless, sleep talking involves mumbling or even complete sentences during sleep. It's often triggered by stress, fever, or lack of sleep. Unlike night terrors, nightmares occur during REM sleep and are vividly remembered. If frequent, they may indicate emotional stress or trauma and can disrupt sleep quality. Although rare in children, sleep paralysis involves temporary inability to move or speak upon waking. It can be frightening but is usually harmless and linked to poor sleep cycles. Though often not classified strictly as parasomnia, persistent bedwetting in older children may coincide with other sleep disturbances and needs evaluation if it continues beyond the typical age. According to the National Sleep Foundation, common parasomnias include sleepwalking, night terrors, confusional arousals, and nightmares, often influenced by stress, fever, or irregular sleep schedules. A family history of parasomnias increases the likelihood in children. Irregular sleep routines and insufficient rest can trigger episodes. Emotional disturbances or trauma can contribute to nightmares and sleepwalking. High temperatures can increase the frequency of night terrors. Some drugs affecting the nervous system may induce parasomnias. Sudden noise or light changes during sleep can trigger abnormal sleep behaviours. Always consult a paediatrician if symptoms persist, worsen, or impact daytime functioning, early intervention can make all the difference in a child's wellbeing. Ensure regular bedtime and wake-up times. Avoid screens, loud noises, and caffeine before bed. These can reduce fear associated with night terrors or nightmares. Help children express emotions and reduce anxiety through play or therapy. Lock doors and windows, remove obstacles, and avoid bunk beds for sleepwalkers. If parasomnias are frequent or disruptive, a medical evaluation is advised. Parasomnia in children, while concerning for parents, is often a temporary phase that resolves with time and proper sleep hygiene. Understanding the types, triggers, and management strategies can provide reassurance and improve a child's sleep quality.

https://doctor.ndtv.com/living-healthy/7-common-triggers-of-migraine-in-summers-8295916,7 Common Triggers Of Migraine In Summers,"Updated: Apr 30, 2025 06:32 IST","For migraine sufferers, summer isn't always sunshine and happiness. Rising temperatures, intense humidity, and shifting routines can all become silent triggers. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO) and studies published by the American Migraine Foundation, environmental factors such as heat, dehydration, and bright light can exacerbate migraine episodes, particularly in warmer months. Understanding these seasonal triggers is essential for individuals who experience recurrent migraine attacks. By identifying and avoiding specific summer-related stimuli, people can reduce both the frequency and severity of migraines, leading to better control and an improved quality of life during the hottest months of the year. Summer heat can influence neurological and vascular systems, increasing the risk of migraines. Sudden weather changes, sun exposure, and poor hydration may lead to dilated blood vessels, a known contributor to migraines. According to the National Headache Foundation, these environmental factors often intensify the condition. Recognising these patterns is the first step toward prevention and effective migraine management. These are the most common triggers of migraine in summers. Let's explore the science behind this fermented favourite. With packed itineraries and limited access to clean facilities, hygiene can often take a back seat. Here are 7 essential hygiene tips to help you stay healthy and safe while travelling. Sweating more in the heat without replenishing fluids can lead to dehydration, a top migraine trigger. Even mild dehydration can cause headaches. Always carry water, and increase intake of fluids, especially when outdoors. Bright sunlight and high UV rays can overstimulate the brain's visual cortex. Prolonged exposure can lead to photophobia (light sensitivity) and trigger migraines. Sunglasses, wide-brimmed hats, and limiting time outdoors during peak hours are essential. High temperatures combined with humidity can cause your body to overheat, disturbing internal temperature regulation and increasing the risk of migraine. Stay in cool environments and use fans or air-conditioning to reduce impact. Summer routines often lead to irregular eating. Skipping meals causes blood sugar levels to drop, a common migraine trigger. Eat light but balanced meals every 3-4 hours to maintain energy and avoid crashes. Longer days can disrupt the body's sleep-wake cycle, especially if you're staying up late or waking earlier. Poor or irregular sleep is directly linked to migraine episodes. Aim for 7-9 hours of quality sleep daily. Cold coffees, sodas, and energy drinks may seem refreshing but often contain caffeine and sugar, both of which can aggravate migraines. Sudden intake or withdrawal from caffeine can also contribute to headaches. Summer often brings stronger odours, perfumes, sweat, pesticides, or chlorinated pool water, all of which can trigger migraines in sensitive individuals. Also, increased pollen and pollution can worsen sinus inflammation, another migraine pathway. Simple changes like staying hydrated, regulating sleep, and protecting yourself from extreme heat and sunlight go a long way. With vigilance and preventive care, those prone to migraines can enjoy a more comfortable and pain-free summer season. 1. Maintain a migraine diary to track specific seasonal triggers 2. Use cooling face towels and stay indoors during high-heat hours (12-4 pm) 3. Eat hydrating foods like cucumbers, watermelon, and yoghurt 4. Avoid sudden exposure to air conditioning after extreme heat 5. Keep sunglasses and an umbrella handy when outdoors 6. Limit screen time to avoid light-triggered headaches 7. Try relaxation techniques like meditation or breathing exercises to reduce stress While migraines can feel unpredictable, recognising and managing summer-specific triggers can make a substantial difference.

https://doctor.ndtv.com/diabetes/7-high-glycemic-foods-diabetics-should-avoid-8295895,7 High Glycemic Foods Diabetics Should Avoid,"Updated: Apr 30, 2025 06:22 IST","Managing diabetes effectively requires more than just medication, it hinges heavily on dietary choices. One of the most important factors in diabetic nutrition is the glycemic index (GI) of foods. The World Health Organisation (WHO) and the American Diabetes Association (ADA) both highlight the importance of avoiding high-GI foods, as they can cause rapid spikes in blood glucose levels. These foods are quickly broken down into sugar, which makes them risky for people with type 2 or type 1 diabetes. Being aware of high-GI foods and replacing them with healthier alternatives is key to keeping blood sugar levels stable and avoiding complications. The glycemic index ranks carbohydrates from 0 to 100 based on how fast they raise blood sugar. High-GI foods (above 70) cause sharp increases in glucose, leading to insulin spikes. Over time, this can worsen insulin resistance and increase the risk of complications. Monitoring GI can help diabetics maintain stable sugar levels and support long-term metabolic health. Here are mentioned 7 high glycemic foods diabetics should avoid. Let's explore the science behind this fermented favourite. With packed itineraries and limited access to clean facilities, hygiene can often take a back seat. Here are 7 essential hygiene tips to help you stay healthy and safe while travelling. Made from refined flour, white bread has a GI of around 75. It lacks fibre and nutrients, leading to a fast release of sugar into the bloodstream. Opt for wholegrain or multigrain bread instead. Cornflakes and puffed rice cereals may seem convenient, but they are among the highest GI foods (GI 80+). Choose high-fibre oats or unsweetened muesli to prevent sugar spikes after breakfast. Polished white rice, especially when overcooked, has a GI above 70. It can significantly raise post-meal glucose levels. Brown rice, quinoa, or millets like bajra or jowar are much healthier alternatives for Indian diets. Potatoes have a naturally high starch content. Mashed potatoes, with a GI of 85 or more, are especially problematic. Sweet potatoes or boiled potatoes in moderation with fibre-rich meals may be safer. These are loaded with added sugars and lack fibre, causing an immediate sugar surge. Their GI is often above 75. Diabetics should stick to water, unsweetened herbal teas, or diluted fresh lemon water. Refined pasta is quickly digested and converted into glucose. It ranks high on the GI scale unless paired with fibre and protein. Whole wheat pasta or zucchini noodles offer better glycemic control. While nutritious, watermelon has a GI of 76. Though its glycemic load is moderate due to high water content, large servings can still cause a sugar spike. Limit portion size and balance with protein. Replacing these items with low-GI, nutrient-rich alternatives is a simple yet powerful step toward better health and a more balanced lifestyle. 1. Combine high GI items with protein or fibre to slow glucose absorption. 2. Avoid cooking starchy foods for too long, as this increases their GI. 3. Use the “plate method”: half veggies, one-quarter protein, and one-quarter whole grain. 4. Keep a food diary to track reactions to specific foods. Understanding and managing the glycemic index of your diet is crucial for diabetes care. By avoiding or limiting these high-GI foods, diabetics can maintain more consistent blood sugar levels and reduce the risk of long-term complications.

https://doctor.ndtv.com/living-healthy/can-laughter-boost-your-well-being-8338425,Can Laughter Boost Your Well-Being?,"Updated: May 5, 2025 10:52 IST","Laughter is often called the best medicine, and for good reason. Beyond being a spontaneous response to humour, laughter has scientifically proven benefits for physical and mental well-being. According to the Mayo Clinic and the American Psychological Association (APA), laughter can lower stress hormones, boost immunity, improve heart health, and even relieve pain. In a world increasingly filled with pressure and anxiety, a hearty laugh may be the simplest tool to restore balance. But is it just a mood booster, or does laughter have long-term health implications? Let's explore how your chuckles can be good for your health. Studies from the Mayo Clinic and National Institutes of Health (NIH) confirm that laughter stimulates multiple body systems. It enhances oxygen intake, stimulates the heart and lungs, and releases feel-good endorphins. Over time, regular laughter can reduce stress, support mental clarity, and improve immune response, making it a valuable and natural form of daily self-care. According to the National Eating Disorders Association (NEDA), orthorexia often involves rigid rules, food-related anxiety, and social isolation. The Ministry of AYUSHrecommends seasonal diets aligned with Ayurvedic principles for better health and wellness during extreme weather conditions. Laughter lowers levels of cortisol and adrenaline, hormones linked to stress. A study published in the journal Alternative Therapies in Health and Medicine found that participants who laughed regularly had significantly reduced stress levels. A good laugh increases your heart rate and improves blood circulation, similar to light exercise. According to the American Heart Association, laughter may improve blood vessel function and reduce the risk of heart disease. Laughter boosts the production of natural killer cells, antibodies, and infection-fighting T-cells, helping the body ward off illness more efficiently, as observed by research cited by the National Cancer Institute. Endorphins released during laughter act as natural painkillers. Patients with chronic pain have reported reduced discomfort and improved tolerance after regular exposure to humour therapy sessions. Laughter is linked to lower levels of anxiety and depression. It encourages a positive outlook, promotes relaxation, and increases resilience during emotional hardship. Cognitive-behavioural therapists often use humour as part of treatment to reframe negative thoughts. Laughing together strengthens bonds and builds trust among people. Whether it's through shared jokes or funny stories, laughter creates a sense of belonging, which is vital for emotional well-being. Some studies suggest that laughter before bedtime may improve sleep by reducing muscle tension and lowering stress levels, contributing to deeper, more restful sleep. Laughter brings people into the present moment, similar to meditation. It encourages us to let go of overthinking and simply enjoy the here and now, a practice that improves overall mental clarity and peace. Watch a comedy show, join a laughter yoga group, recall funny memories, or simply spend time with playful people. The key is intentionality, seek humour in daily life and don't take everything seriously. As per Laughter Yoga International, even simulated laughter offers similar health benefits, as the body responds to it the same way as genuine laughter. Laughter isn't just a spontaneous reaction; it's a scientifically supported health booster. It improves mood, strengthens the body, and brings people closer together. So the next time you feel overwhelmed or tired, take a humour break, because sometimes, a good laugh is all the therapy you need. Remember, the best medicine is free and already within you.

But when this desire turns into an obsession, it might be something more serious, orthorexia nervosa. Unlike other eating disorders that focus on the quantity of food, orthorexia is an unhealthy fixation on the quality and purity of food. While not officially recognised by the DSM-5 (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders), growing awareness among psychologists and nutritionists worldwide suggests that orthorexia is a rising concern, especially in health-conscious societies. So how do you know if you're eating healthy, or crossing the line? Orthorexia starts with good intentions, avoiding processed foods, sugar, or additives, but escalates into an unhealthy obsession. According to the National Eating Disorders Association (NEDA), orthorexia often involves rigid rules, food-related anxiety, and social isolation. While clean eating promotes balance, orthorexia lacks flexibility, causing stress, malnutrition, and emotional distress despite appearing “healthy” on the surface. Over time, regular laughter can reduce stress, support mental clarity, and improve immune response, making it a valuable and natural form of daily self-care. The Ministry of AYUSHrecommends seasonal diets aligned with Ayurvedic principles for better health and wellness during extreme weather conditions. While it's wise to understand what goes into your food, orthorexic individuals may spend hours scrutinising every label, ingredient, and sourcing detail, often rejecting food not meeting self-imposed purity standards. Cutting out gluten, dairy, or carbs without allergies or intolerances may be a red flag. Orthorexia can lead people to eliminate foods not because of symptoms but based on misinformation or fear. Feeling morally “better” than others for your food choices is another sign. Orthorexia can create a divide between “good” and “bad” eaters, increasing social judgment and personal guilt around food. People with orthorexia often experience anxiety, guilt, or distress if they have to eat outside their dietary rules, such as at social events, family meals, or restaurants. Skipping gatherings or being overly rigid about where and what you eat may indicate that orthorexia is impacting your quality of life and isolating you socially. If a significant part of your day revolves around planning, sourcing, or preparing food with perfect standards, it may be more than just a healthy habit. Listening to your body is essential for well-being. People with orthorexia often ignore hunger or fatigue if they can't find food that meets their standards, prioritising purity over nourishment. Ironically, orthorexia can result in undernourishment. Eliminating too many foods might lead to deficiencies in protein, iron, B12, and healthy fats, impacting your overall health despite “eating clean.” If your eating habits are driven more by fear than by nourishment, it's time to pause. Seek help from a psychologist, dietitian, or a specialist in eating disorders. According to NEDA, early intervention improves recovery outcomes. Mindful eating, therapy, and balanced nutrition can help you reclaim a healthy relationship with food, body, and life. Orthorexia blurs the line between wellness and obsession. While being mindful of food is admirable, it should not control your happiness or isolate you. A truly healthy eater embraces flexibility, balance, and emotional well-being. If your eating habits are starting to limit your joy, reach out, because health is not just what you eat, but how you live.

According to Ayurveda, an ancient Indian system of medicine, summer aggravates the Pitta dosha, the energy responsible for heat, metabolism, and transformation in the body. To maintain balance, Ayurveda recommends specific cooling foods that help pacify Pitta, hydrate the system, and keep you energised throughout the hot months. Backed by holistic wisdom and now supported by nutrition science, these foods can be easily included in your daily routine for a more refreshing and healthier summer. Ayurveda believes food is medicine, and every season demands dietary adjustments. In summer, cooling and hydrating foods soothe the overheated body and prevent seasonal ailments. These foods balance your doshas, boost immunity, and improve digestion. The Ministry of AYUSH recommends seasonal diets aligned with Ayurvedic principles for better health and wellness during extreme weather conditions. Over time, regular laughter can reduce stress, support mental clarity, and improve immune response, making it a valuable and natural form of daily self-care. According to the National Eating Disorders Association (NEDA), orthorexia often involves rigid rules, food-related anxiety, and social isolation. Naturally sweet and packed with electrolytes, coconut water is considered a “Pitta-pacifying” drink. It cools the body, prevents dehydration, and aids digestion. It's also rich in potassium and magnesium, making it perfect for summer hydration. A powerhouse of Vitamin C, amla detoxifies the body and boosts immunity.

Yet, millions across the world, including in parts of India, rely on sources that may be contaminated with bacteria, viruses, parasites, or harmful chemicals. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), unsafe drinking water contributes to over half a million diarrhoeal deaths each year. Ensuring water is properly purified before consumption is vital for safe usage, especially during monsoons or in areas with poor sanitation. Here's a comprehensive guide to simple and effective water purification methods you can use at home or during emergencies. Contaminated water can cause diseases like cholera, typhoid, dysentery, and hepatitis A. Even clear-looking water may harbour invisible pathogens or chemicals. Purification removes or kills these harmful agents, making water safe for drinking, cooking, and hygiene. Whether you're using municipal supplies, wells, or stored tank water, purification ensures health protection for you and your family. Over time, regular laughter can reduce stress, support mental clarity, and improve immune response, making it a valuable and natural form of daily self-care. According to the National Eating Disorders Association (NEDA), orthorexia often involves rigid rules, food-related anxiety, and social isolation. Boiling water for at least 1–3 minutes kills most bacteria, viruses, and parasites. It's an ideal method during emergencies or when you suspect contamination. Let it cool naturally and store in a clean, covered container. WHO recommends boiling as a reliable household water treatment. Modern water purifiers use Reverse Osmosis (RO), Ultraviolet (UV), or Ultrafiltration (UF) technologies. RO filters out heavy metals, chemicals, and dissolved salts. UV kills microorganisms by destroying their DNA. UF removes bacteria and some viruses but doesn't eliminate dissolved salts. Choose a purifier based on your water source, groundwater, borewell, or municipal supply. Chlorine is a powerful disinfectant used by civic bodies to treat water. At home, you can use chlorine tablets (as per instructions) for stored water in emergencies. It's especially useful during floods or natural disasters. However, avoid overuse and ensure proper dosage to prevent side effects. In rural or resource-limited areas, solar disinfection can be a lifesaver. Fill transparent plastic bottles with water and leave them in direct sunlight for 6-8 hours. UV-A rays and heat work together to kill pathogens. This method is endorsed by WHO and is low-cost and sustainable. Ceramic filters or gravity-based filters are good non-electric options. They trap bacteria and sediments through microporous membranes. Some models also include activated carbon to improve taste and remove odour. They're ideal for rural homes or areas with electricity issues. Activated carbon filters can reduce chlorine, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and improve taste. Though they don't kill pathogens, they are excellent when used in combination with other purification methods. Many household water filters use carbon as a secondary purification layer. Distillation involves boiling water and collecting the steam back as liquid, leaving most contaminants behind. It's effective for removing heavy metals like lead and arsenic but consumes more energy. It's a practical solution when dealing with chemical contamination. Purified water can get contaminated if not stored correctly. Always use clean, covered containers made of food-grade plastic, stainless steel, or glass. Avoid dipping unclean hands or utensils into the container. Wash storage vessels frequently to maintain hygiene. Safe water is the cornerstone of good health. While advanced purification systems are available, traditional methods like boiling or solar disinfection still play a vital role in emergencies or rural settings. Understanding and practising water purification at home ensures your family is shielded from waterborne illnesses. When in doubt, purify, and protect your health, one drop at a time.

The gut is home to trillions of bacteria that influence digestion, immunity, inflammation, and even mental health. Poor food choices, especially at night, can lead to bloating, indigestion, acid reflux, or disrupted sleep. Choosing gut-friendly foods for dinner supports smoother digestion and allows the body to rest and repair the digestive tract overnight. In this article, we share a list of foods you can add to your dinner if you have gut issues.   Lightly steamed veggies like carrots, zucchini, spinach, and pumpkin are easier to digest than raw ones. Cooking breaks down fibre and makes nutrients more absorbable, while still providing essential vitamins and minerals. These vegetables are gentle on the stomach and help feed beneficial gut bacteria.  Ginger has natural anti-inflammatory and gas-relieving properties. Adding fresh ginger to soups, dals, or stir-fries during dinner can ease bloating, support digestion, and prevent nausea. It's especially helpful if you suffer from gas or slow digestion at night.  Rich in probiotics, plain yogurt helps replenish good bacteria in the gut. Including a small portion of unsweetened yogurt with dinner can aid digestion and support gut balance. It's best paired with cooked grains or fruits like banana or papaya for a soothing end to the meal.  This traditional Indian dish combines moong dal (yellow lentils) and rice, making it both light and nourishing. It's easy to digest and provides protein, fibre, and essential nutrients. When cooked with ghee and mild spices like cumin and turmeric, khichdi becomes a perfect gut-soothing dinner.  These are rich in fibre but low in fermentable sugars, making them easy on sensitive stomachs. Their natural sweetness and soft texture (when cooked) make them ideal for soups or stews, helping to soothe the gut lining and improve bowel movement.  Though usually eaten for breakfast, plain oatmeal can be a great dinner for those with digestive issues. It's full of soluble fibre, which helps form a gel-like consistency in the gut, slowing digestion and easing symptoms like diarrhoea or constipation. Add turmeric or cinnamon for extra gut benefits.  Sauerkraut, kimchi, or fermented carrots contain natural probiotics that support the gut microbiome. Adding just a spoonful to dinner can enhance digestion. However, if you're new to fermented foods, start small to avoid gas or bloating.  Bone broth is rich in gelatine and amino acids like glutamine that support the gut lining and reduce inflammation. Sipping warm bone broth with your meal can help repair leaky gut, soothe the stomach, and improve nutrient absorption.  Papaya contains an enzyme called papain, which aids protein digestion and prevents bloating. Having a few slices of ripe papaya after dinner or mixed into a salad can reduce heaviness and support smoother digestion before bedtime.   Fibre-rich, anti-inflammatory, and probiotic foods can nourish the gut microbiome, while avoiding heavy, greasy, or processed meals can reduce discomfort and promote better gut health over time.

These Tips Can Help,"Updated: May 5, 2025 05:26 IST","Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs) are infections that occur in any part of the urinary system, including the kidneys, ureters, bladder, or urethra. They are commonly caused by bacteria which can enter the urinary tract through the urethra and multiply in the bladder. UTIs are more common in women due to their shorter urethra, which makes it easier for bacteria to reach the bladder. Symptoms may include a strong urge to urinate, a burning sensation during urination, cloudy or strong-smelling urine, and pelvic pain. If left untreated, UTIs can lead to more serious kidney infections. Keep reading as we share tips to reduce your risk of UTIs.  Maintaining good hygiene, staying hydrated, and adopting healthy habits can significantly lower the chances of UTIs in women. Here are ten essential tips to reduce the risk of UTI in women. Let's delve into the causes, prevention strategies, and treatment options for UTIs during pregnancy, ensuring expectant mothers have the knowledge to protect their health.  Drinking plenty of water throughout the day helps flush bacteria out of the urinary tract before they can cause an infection. Aim for at least 8 glasses of water a day, and drink even more in hot weather or after exercise. Proper hydration also dilutes urine, reducing irritation during urination if bacteria are present.  Holding urine for long periods allows bacteria more time to grow in the bladder. Try to urinate every 3–4 hours, even if you don't feel a strong urge. Emptying the bladder regularly keeps it free from bacteria and helps maintain overall urinary health.  After using the toilet, always wipe from front to back to prevent bacteria from the anal area from entering the urethra. This is especially important for women because of the close proximity between the urethra and anus. This simple hygiene step significantly reduces the risk of transferring bacteria to the urinary tract.  Sexual activity can push bacteria toward the urethra. Urinating soon after intercourse helps flush out any bacteria that may have entered the urinary tract. It's also beneficial to clean the genital area gently before and after sex to lower the risk of infection.  Products like douches, scented sprays, or powders can irritate the urethra and disrupt the natural balance of bacteria in the genital area. Stick to mild, unscented soap and water for cleaning the external genital area, and avoid inserting any products into the vagina.  Tight clothes and non-breathable fabrics create a warm, moist environment that encourages bacterial growth. Wearing cotton underwear and loose-fitting pants or skirts improves airflow and reduces moisture, making it harder for bacteria to thrive.  Soaking in bathtubs, especially with bubble bath or bath oils, can irritate the urethra and increase the chance of infection. Showers are generally safer for the urinary tract. If you prefer baths, keep them short, avoid harsh products, and rinse well afterward.  Regular and gentle washing of the genital area helps prevent bacteria buildup. However, avoid over-washing or using antibacterial soaps, which can disrupt the natural flora and make infections more likely. During menstruation, change sanitary pads or tampons frequently to reduce bacterial growth.  If you experience frequent UTIs consult a healthcare provider. Staying proactive about your urinary health can prevent future infections and complications.   Disclaimer: This content including advice provides generic information only.

https://doctor.ndtv.com/living-healthy/can-laughter-boost-your-well-being-8338425,Can Laughter Boost Your Well-Being?,"Updated: May 5, 2025 10:52 IST","Laughter is often called the best medicine, and for good reason. Beyond being a spontaneous response to humour, laughter has scientifically proven benefits for physical and mental well-being. According to the Mayo Clinic and the American Psychological Association (APA), laughter can lower stress hormones, boost immunity, improve heart health, and even relieve pain. In a world increasingly filled with pressure and anxiety, a hearty laugh may be the simplest tool to restore balance. But is it just a mood booster, or does laughter have long-term health implications? Let's explore how your chuckles can be good for your health. Studies from the Mayo Clinic and National Institutes of Health (NIH) confirm that laughter stimulates multiple body systems. It enhances oxygen intake, stimulates the heart and lungs, and releases feel-good endorphins. Over time, regular laughter can reduce stress, support mental clarity, and improve immune response, making it a valuable and natural form of daily self-care. According to the National Eating Disorders Association (NEDA), orthorexia often involves rigid rules, food-related anxiety, and social isolation. The Ministry of AYUSHrecommends seasonal diets aligned with Ayurvedic principles for better health and wellness during extreme weather conditions. Laughter lowers levels of cortisol and adrenaline, hormones linked to stress. A study published in the journal Alternative Therapies in Health and Medicine found that participants who laughed regularly had significantly reduced stress levels. A good laugh increases your heart rate and improves blood circulation, similar to light exercise. According to the American Heart Association, laughter may improve blood vessel function and reduce the risk of heart disease. Laughter boosts the production of natural killer cells, antibodies, and infection-fighting T-cells, helping the body ward off illness more efficiently, as observed by research cited by the National Cancer Institute. Endorphins released during laughter act as natural painkillers. Patients with chronic pain have reported reduced discomfort and improved tolerance after regular exposure to humour therapy sessions. Laughter is linked to lower levels of anxiety and depression. It encourages a positive outlook, promotes relaxation, and increases resilience during emotional hardship. Cognitive-behavioural therapists often use humour as part of treatment to reframe negative thoughts. Laughing together strengthens bonds and builds trust among people. Whether it's through shared jokes or funny stories, laughter creates a sense of belonging, which is vital for emotional well-being. Some studies suggest that laughter before bedtime may improve sleep by reducing muscle tension and lowering stress levels, contributing to deeper, more restful sleep. Laughter brings people into the present moment, similar to meditation. It encourages us to let go of overthinking and simply enjoy the here and now, a practice that improves overall mental clarity and peace. Watch a comedy show, join a laughter yoga group, recall funny memories, or simply spend time with playful people. The key is intentionality, seek humour in daily life and don't take everything seriously. As per Laughter Yoga International, even simulated laughter offers similar health benefits, as the body responds to it the same way as genuine laughter. Laughter isn't just a spontaneous reaction; it's a scientifically supported health booster. It improves mood, strengthens the body, and brings people closer together. So the next time you feel overwhelmed or tired, take a humour break, because sometimes, a good laugh is all the therapy you need. Remember, the best medicine is free and already within you.

https://doctor.ndtv.com/living-healthy/are-you-a-healthy-eater-or-is-it-orthorexia-8338119,Are You A Healthy Eater Or Is It Orthorexia?,"Updated: May 5, 2025 10:40 IST","Choosing healthy food is often considered a sign of discipline and self-care. But when this desire turns into an obsession, it might be something more serious, orthorexia nervosa. Unlike other eating disorders that focus on the quantity of food, orthorexia is an unhealthy fixation on the quality and purity of food. While not officially recognised by the DSM-5 (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders), growing awareness among psychologists and nutritionists worldwide suggests that orthorexia is a rising concern, especially in health-conscious societies. So how do you know if you're eating healthy, or crossing the line? Orthorexia starts with good intentions, avoiding processed foods, sugar, or additives, but escalates into an unhealthy obsession. According to the National Eating Disorders Association (NEDA), orthorexia often involves rigid rules, food-related anxiety, and social isolation. While clean eating promotes balance, orthorexia lacks flexibility, causing stress, malnutrition, and emotional distress despite appearing “healthy” on the surface. Over time, regular laughter can reduce stress, support mental clarity, and improve immune response, making it a valuable and natural form of daily self-care. The Ministry of AYUSHrecommends seasonal diets aligned with Ayurvedic principles for better health and wellness during extreme weather conditions. While it's wise to understand what goes into your food, orthorexic individuals may spend hours scrutinising every label, ingredient, and sourcing detail, often rejecting food not meeting self-imposed purity standards. Cutting out gluten, dairy, or carbs without allergies or intolerances may be a red flag. Orthorexia can lead people to eliminate foods not because of symptoms but based on misinformation or fear. Feeling morally “better” than others for your food choices is another sign. Orthorexia can create a divide between “good” and “bad” eaters, increasing social judgment and personal guilt around food. People with orthorexia often experience anxiety, guilt, or distress if they have to eat outside their dietary rules, such as at social events, family meals, or restaurants. Skipping gatherings or being overly rigid about where and what you eat may indicate that orthorexia is impacting your quality of life and isolating you socially. If a significant part of your day revolves around planning, sourcing, or preparing food with perfect standards, it may be more than just a healthy habit. Listening to your body is essential for well-being. People with orthorexia often ignore hunger or fatigue if they can't find food that meets their standards, prioritising purity over nourishment. Ironically, orthorexia can result in undernourishment. Eliminating too many foods might lead to deficiencies in protein, iron, B12, and healthy fats, impacting your overall health despite “eating clean.” If your eating habits are driven more by fear than by nourishment, it's time to pause. Seek help from a psychologist, dietitian, or a specialist in eating disorders. According to NEDA, early intervention improves recovery outcomes. Mindful eating, therapy, and balanced nutrition can help you reclaim a healthy relationship with food, body, and life. Orthorexia blurs the line between wellness and obsession. While being mindful of food is admirable, it should not control your happiness or isolate you. A truly healthy eater embraces flexibility, balance, and emotional well-being. If your eating habits are starting to limit your joy, reach out, because health is not just what you eat, but how you live.

According to Ayurveda, an ancient Indian system of medicine, summer aggravates the Pitta dosha, the energy responsible for heat, metabolism, and transformation in the body. To maintain balance, Ayurveda recommends specific cooling foods that help pacify Pitta, hydrate the system, and keep you energised throughout the hot months. Backed by holistic wisdom and now supported by nutrition science, these foods can be easily included in your daily routine for a more refreshing and healthier summer. Ayurveda believes food is medicine, and every season demands dietary adjustments. In summer, cooling and hydrating foods soothe the overheated body and prevent seasonal ailments. These foods balance your doshas, boost immunity, and improve digestion. The Ministry of AYUSH recommends seasonal diets aligned with Ayurvedic principles for better health and wellness during extreme weather conditions. Over time, regular laughter can reduce stress, support mental clarity, and improve immune response, making it a valuable and natural form of daily self-care. According to the National Eating Disorders Association (NEDA), orthorexia often involves rigid rules, food-related anxiety, and social isolation. Naturally sweet and packed with electrolytes, coconut water is considered a “Pitta-pacifying” drink. It cools the body, prevents dehydration, and aids digestion. It's also rich in potassium and magnesium, making it perfect for summer hydration. A powerhouse of Vitamin C, amla detoxifies the body and boosts immunity. Its cooling nature makes it effective in reducing body heat and improving skin health. Have it raw, as juice, or in the form of chyawanprash. Light, probiotic-rich, and cooling, buttermilk improves digestion and prevents bloating caused by heat. Seasoned with cumin and coriander, it enhances its detoxifying and soothing properties. Ayurveda recommends it as a daily post-lunch drink during summer. Sabja seeds, soaked in water, swell into a gel-like texture and are known to reduce body heat. Often used in sherbets and coolers, they aid digestion, reduce acidity, and act as natural body coolants. Crisp, hydrating, and alkaline, cucumber is one of the best summer vegetables. Ayurveda classifies it as a cooling food that soothes the stomach, hydrates cells, and helps eliminate toxins. It's ideal as a salad or juice ingredient. Pudina is a classic cooling herb that stimulates digestion, clears nasal congestion, and brings down internal heat. It can be used in chutneys, buttermilk, or infused in water for an aromatic summer detox drink. This juicy fruit is 90% water and rich in antioxidants like lycopene. It reduces inflammation, quenches thirst, and prevents heatstroke. Ayurveda encourages its consumption in moderation and on an empty stomach for best results. Fennel seeds have a sweet, cooling effect on the body. A fennel infusion or simply chewing fennel seeds post meals can ease digestion, reduce acidity, and lower Pitta-related imbalances. Made from fresh rose petals and sugar, Gulkand is a traditional Ayurvedic coolant. It cools the digestive tract, relieves acidity, and prevents mouth ulcers. One spoon daily can keep internal heat in check. Often overlooked, lauki is a hydrating vegetable with high water content and cooling qualities. It helps reduce high blood pressure and body heat. Consuming it as juice or lightly cooked curry is beneficial in summer. Ayurveda offers a time-tested guide to adapt your diet seasonally for optimal health. These cooling foods are not just delicious but also therapeutic, helping you manage summer heat naturally. By incorporating them into your daily meals, you'll feel lighter, refreshed, and more balanced. Let your summer plate reflect ancient wisdom for modern wellness. Eat cool, stay cool.

These Tips Can Help,"Updated: Jul 10, 2025 11:51 IST","Bowel issues during periods are quite common due to hormonal changes, especially fluctuating levels of prostaglandins and progesterone. These hormones can affect digestion and bowel movement patterns, leading to symptoms like diarrhoea, constipation, bloating, or abdominal cramping. Prostaglandins can stimulate muscle contractions in the intestines, resulting in looser stools, while a drop in progesterone may slow digestion, causing constipation. While these symptoms are usually harmless, they can be uncomfortable. Fortunately, some simple dietary and lifestyle tips can help ease bowel-related issues during menstruation. In this article, we outline a list of tips that can help minimise bowel issues one might experience during their periods.  Conditions like endometriosis, fibroids, or pelvic inflammatory disease may cause intense menstrual pain and require medical attention. Below we discuss common causes. Steering clear of certain foods, habits, or activities can help reduce these symptoms, stabilise energy levels, and support your bodys natural rhythm.  Drinking plenty of water helps prevent constipation and supports healthy digestion. It can also reduce bloating by flushing out excess sodium and aiding smooth bowel movement.  Fibre-rich foods like oats, whole grains, fruits, and vegetables can help regulate your bowel movements. Soluble fibre eases diarrhoea by absorbing excess water, while insoluble fibre combats constipation.  Caffeine can stimulate the bowels too much, worsening diarrhoea, while sugary drinks can cause bloating and gas. Reducing these during your period can help stabilise your digestion.  Some people become temporarily more lactose intolerant during their period. If dairy makes you gassy or bloated, consider skipping it to ease bowel discomfort.  Foods like yogurt, kefir, or fermented vegetables support healthy gut bacteria, which can help balance digestion and reduce cramping or irregular bowel habits.  Gentle exercise, like walking or yoga, stimulates digestion and reduces bloating and constipation. It also helps with overall period pain and mood regulation.  Instead of heavy meals, try eating lighter meals more often. This helps your digestive system cope better and can prevent bloating or sudden bowel urgency.  These can irritate the stomach and speed up digestion, increasing the chances of diarrhoea or stomach cramps. Stick to easily digestible meals during your period.  A warm compress or heating pad not only relieves cramps but can also relax your intestinal muscles, easing bowel movements and abdominal discomfort.  Keep a journal of your bowel habits and diet during your cycle. This can help you identify patterns or food triggers and make it easier to adjust your routine accordingly.  Follow these tips today to overcome bowel issues during periods.  Disclaimer: This content including advice provides generic information only.

https://doctor.ndtv.com/living-healthy/kidney-stones-these-foods-might-be-an-enemy-8849753,Kidney Stones? These Foods Might Be An Enemy,"Updated: Jul 9, 2025 06:33 IST","Kidney stones are hard mineral and salt deposits that form in the kidneys when urine becomes too concentrated, allowing these substances to crystallise and stick together. They can vary in size and cause severe pain, especially when passing through the urinary tract. While genetics, dehydration, and certain health conditions contribute to their formation, diet plays a major role too. Some foods can increase levels of oxalate, calcium, uric acid, or sodium in the urine, compounds that can contribute to kidney stone formation. Being aware of these ""enemy"" foods can help those prone to stones prevent recurrence and protect their kidney health. In this article, we share foods to avoid if you have kidney stones.  Kidney stones can cause severe pain and discomfort. Several diet modifications can help in controlling the risk of kidney stones. Here are some foods you must avoid. Kidney stones: A diet high in protein and salt can lead to formation of kidney stones. Read here to know foods to eat and avoid for preventing kidney stones.  Spinach is high in oxalates, which bind with calcium in the kidneys to form calcium oxalate stones, the most common type. While it's nutritious, consuming large amounts can raise the risk, especially when not balanced with calcium-rich foods.  Like spinach, beets contain high oxalate levels. People who are prone to calcium oxalate stones should limit beetroot and beet juice, as regular consumption can significantly increase oxalate buildup in urine.  Although healthy in moderation, nuts like almonds, cashews, and peanuts are oxalate-rich. For those with a history of kidney stones, consuming these in excess may worsen the risk of recurrence.  Dark chocolate and cocoa are surprisingly high in oxalates. While small amounts occasionally may be fine, regular or excessive consumption can be problematic for people susceptible to kidney stones.  Black tea is another oxalate-heavy beverage. Drinking too much especially without enough water can raise oxalate levels and contribute to stone formation. Herbal teas with lower oxalate content can be better alternatives.  Red meat is high in purines, which can increase uric acid levels in the body. Excessive uric acid can lead to uric acid stones. Cutting back on animal protein can help prevent these types of stones from forming.  High-sodium diets cause calcium to be excreted more in the urine, promoting calcium stone formation. Canned soups, chips, fast food, and other salty snacks are best minimised for kidney health.  Cola contains phosphoric acid, which may contribute to stone formation. Sugary sodas and beverages can also increase uric acid and reduce urine volume, both risk factors for kidney stones.  This vegetable is another oxalate-rich food that can spike levels in the urine. Its sharp sourness is matched by its strong effect on kidney stone formation in sensitive individuals.  High doses of vitamin C can be metabolised into oxalate in the body. Regular intake of large amounts may raise the risk of oxalate stones and should be avoided without medical guidance.  For individuals prone to kidney stones, understanding these dietary triggers is crucial. Staying hydrated, balancing intake of calcium and oxalates, and reducing salt and animal protein can go a long way in preventing painful stone episodes.

https://doctor.ndtv.com/living-healthy/importance-of-proper-sleep-routine-in-teens-8848018,Importance Of Proper Sleep Routine In Teens,"Updated: Jul 9, 2025 02:27 IST","A consistent sleep routine is essential for good health, particularly for teenagers. During adolescence, the body undergoes significant physical, emotional, and mental changes, all of which are supported by adequate rest. However, due to academic pressures, screen time, and hormonal shifts, teens often experience irregular sleep patterns or sleep deprivation. A proper sleep routine helps regulate the body's internal clock, improves mood, supports brain development, and boosts overall well-being. For teens, maintaining a consistent sleep-wake cycle can enhance focus, emotional regulation, and even physical growth. Keep reading as we discuss why a proper sleep routine is important in teens.   Teenagers experience rapid physical growth, and most of this growth happens during deep sleep when growth hormone is released. A consistent sleep routine ensures that teens get enough of this deep sleep, supporting healthy development of bones, muscles, and tissues.  Sleep directly impacts cognitive functions like memory, focus, and problem-solving. Teens with a consistent sleep schedule tend to perform better academically because their brain gets the rest it needs to process and retain information effectively.  Lack of sleep is linked to mood swings, irritability, and even anxiety and depression. A proper sleep routine helps stabilise emotions and boosts mental resilience, which is especially important for teens navigating social and emotional changes.  Sleep strengthens the immune system by allowing the body to repair and fight off infections. During monsoon and seasonal shifts, when teens are more prone to getting sick, a consistent sleep routine helps in keeping their immunity strong.  Irregular sleep patterns can disrupt the balance of hunger hormones, leading to poor food choices and overeating. Teens who sleep well are more likely to maintain a healthy weight and have better control over their appetite.  Teenagers are often affected by acne and other skin issues. Quality sleep allows for skin regeneration and reduces inflammation, making a consistent sleep routine a natural skincare aid.  Sleep recharges the body. Teens involved in sports or physical activities need regular, quality sleep for muscle recovery, endurance, and energy. It directly affects their athletic and daily performance.  Sleep is crucial for maintaining hormonal balance, especially during puberty. Disrupted sleep can affect hormones like melatonin, cortisol, and insulin, potentially impacting mood, growth, and even metabolism.  Teens are known for impulsive behaviour, and sleep deprivation worsens this by impairing judgment and risk assessment. A regular sleep pattern promotes clearer thinking and better decision-making.  Developing a sleep routine during the teenage years creates a strong foundation for long-term health. It instills discipline, improves time management, and sets the tone for a healthier adult lifestyle.  Adopt a healthy sleep routine to boost your health today.

https://doctor.ndtv.com/cancer/10-foods-to-reduce-risk-of-colon-cancer-8843949,10 Foods To Reduce Risk Of Colon Cancer,"Updated: Jul 8, 2025 06:55 IST","Colon cancer, also known as colorectal cancer, is a type of cancer that starts in the large intestine (colon) or rectum. It often begins as small, noncancerous clumps of cells called polyps that can develop into cancer over time. Common risk factors include age, family history, sedentary lifestyle, obesity, smoking, alcohol consumption, and a diet low in fibre and high in red or processed meats. Fortunately, certain dietary choices can play a key role in reducing the risk of colon cancer. Keep reading as we share a list of foods you can have to reduce risk of colon cancer.  Below we share a list of fibre-rich foods you can add to your diet to reduce the risk of colon cancer. Nutritionist Lovneet Batra throws light on certain health benefits of whole grains.  These are rich in fibre, folate, and antioxidants like lutein and carotenoids. They help flush out toxins, reduce inflammation in the colon, and support regular bowel movements, which lower the chances of polyps and cancer formation.  These vegetables contain sulforaphane, a plant compound known for its cancer-fighting properties. Studies show that these veggies can inhibit the growth of cancer cells and detoxify the body of harmful carcinogens.  Whole grains are packed with dietary fibre, which adds bulk to stool and promotes faster elimination of waste, reducing the contact time of potential carcinogens with the colon lining. They also improve gut health and reduce inflammation.  Rich in resistant starch and soluble fibre, legumes help nourish beneficial gut bacteria. This process produces short-chain fatty acids that have anti-cancer properties and reduce inflammation in the colon.  Berries are loaded with powerful antioxidants such as anthocyanins, ellagic acid, and vitamin C. These compounds help protect colon cells from oxidative stress and DNA damage that could lead to cancer.  Omega-3 fatty acids in fatty fish have been linked to lower levels of inflammation in the body. Regular consumption of omega-3-rich fish may help reduce the risk of colon cancer by decreasing the inflammatory response in the digestive tract.  Garlic contains sulphur compounds that activate liver enzymes to destroy carcinogens. Its antibacterial properties also support gut health and may reduce the formation of cancer-causing substances in the colon.  Curcumin, the active compound in turmeric, has strong anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. It may slow the growth of cancer cells and prevent the spread of tumours, making it a valuable addition to a colon-friendly diet.  Probiotics promote a healthy gut microbiome, which plays a major role in immune defence and inflammation control. Regular intake of yogurt with live cultures can help maintain digestive balance and lower the risk of colon issues.  Nuts provide fibre, healthy fats, and antioxidants like selenium and vitamin E. These nutrients combat oxidative stress and support colon health. Moderate consumption of nuts has been linked to a reduced risk of colorectal cancer.  Foods rich in fibre, antioxidants, and anti-inflammatory properties help maintain digestive health, support the gut microbiome, and may prevent the development of cancerous cells in the colon.

https://doctor.ndtv.com/living-healthy/you-can-catch-these-diseases-from-your-pets-8841745,You Can Catch These Diseases From Your Pets,"Updated: Jul 8, 2025 01:50 IST","Humans can catch certain diseases from their pets and these are called zoonotic diseases. While pets offer companionship and health benefits, they can also carry bacteria, viruses, parasites, or fungi that may spread to people. The risk increases with poor hygiene, weakened immune systems, or lack of preventive pet care. However, most pet-related infections are preventable with proper pet handling, regular vet visits, cleanliness, and good personal hygiene. Keep reading as we discuss some diseases you can catch from your pets and how to avoid them.   A fungal infection that affects the skin, scalp, or nails. Pets like cats and dogs can carry it and transmit it through direct contact. Regularly bathe and groom pets. Disinfect areas your pet frequently visits. Avoid touching animals with bald patches or lesions. Always wash your hands after petting or handling pets.  Toxoplasmosis is caused by a parasite found in cat faeces. It's especially risky for pregnant women and those with weak immune systems. Clean the litter box daily while wearing gloves (preferably someone else should do it during pregnancy), and wash hands thoroughly afterward. Avoid undercooked meat, another source of the parasite.  A bacterial infection caused by Bartonella henselae, usually spread through scratches or bites from infected cats. Avoid rough play with cats, especially kittens. Clean scratches or bites immediately with soap and water. Keep cats indoors and flea-free.  Caused by Salmonella bacteria, which can be transmitted through handling reptiles, birds, or contaminated pet food (especially raw diets). Always wash your hands after touching pets or their food. Keep reptiles away from kitchens and children under 5. Avoid feeding pets raw meat without veterinary advice.  A bacterial infection often spread through the urine of infected dogs or wild animals. Humans can contract it through contaminated water or soil. Vaccinate your dog, avoid walking them in floodwaters or muddy areas, and wear gloves when cleaning up pet urine or waste.  A bacterial infection that causes diarrhoea in humans, often transmitted by handling puppies or kittens with diarrhoea. Practice good hygiene when cleaning up after pets. Wash hands after pet contact, especially before eating or cooking.  A deadly virus transmitted through bites from infected animals. It affects the nervous system and is almost always fatal once symptoms appear. Ensure pets are vaccinated against rabies. Avoid contact with stray or wild animals. Seek immediate medical care if bitten or scratched.  These parasites live in the intestines of pets and can be passed to humans through faeces-contaminated soil or pet fur. They can cause skin infections or more serious internal issues. Deworm pets regularly. Promptly clean up pet faeces. Teach children not to play in areas where pets relieve themselves, and ensure they wash their hands afterward.  Regular veterinary checkups, proper pet hygiene, clean surroundings, and awareness are your best tools to enjoy a safe, healthy bond with your furry (or feathery or scaly) friend.

https://doctor.ndtv.com/living-healthy/incorporate-these-ayurvedic-hacks-this-monsoon-to-avoid-seasonal-ailments-8837345,Incorporate These Ayurvedic Hacks This Monsoon To Avoid Seasonal Ailments,"Updated: Jul 7, 2025 04:51 IST","Ayurvedic hacks can be highly effective in preventing seasonal ailments during the monsoon. According to Ayurveda, the rainy season aggravates the Vata and Kapha doshas while weakening Agni (digestive fire), making the body more prone to infections, indigestion, respiratory issues, and joint pain. Ayurveda recommends natural, holistic practices using herbs, spices, diet, and daily routines to balance these doshas, boost immunity, and protect against common monsoon ailments like colds, coughs, fevers, skin infections, and digestive problems. Read on as we share Ayurvedic hacks to help avoid ailments this monsoon.   Drinking warm water infused with ginger or tulsi leaves first thing in the morning helps kindle digestive fire (Agni), flush out toxins, and prevent throat infections. It strengthens the respiratory system and prepares your gut for the day ahead.  Triphala, a mix of amla, haritaki, and bibhitaki helps cleanse the digestive system, prevent constipation, and boost immunity. Consuming it at night with warm water keeps your gut clean and strengthens your overall resistance to infections.  Performing a warm oil massage using sesame oil (or medicated oils like Narayana Tailam) helps calm aggravated Vata, nourishes the skin, lubricates the joints, and improves blood circulation. It also acts as a barrier against skin infections caused by dampness.  Ayurveda advises adding spices like cumin, black pepper, turmeric, ajwain, and asafoetida (hing) to your monsoon meals. These enhance digestion, reduce bloating, and prevent foodborne infections, common during the humid season.  Raw greens can harbour bacteria and worsen digestion during monsoon. Instead, opt for warm, cooked, easy-to-digest foods like khichdi, soups, and steamed vegetables. This helps maintain a balanced Agni and prevents gastrointestinal issues.  Sipping herbal teas made with ingredients like tulsi, cinnamon, cardamom, or mulethi (licorice) helps fight off colds, maintain respiratory health, and keeps the body warm and light. These teas are also calming and support immunity.  Day sleeping during monsoon can increase Kapha accumulation, slowing down metabolism and inviting lethargy, cold, and cough. Ayurveda suggests staying active during the day and resting well at night to maintain natural body rhythms.  Burning camphor or Ayurvedic herbs like sambrani in the home helps purify the air, kill germs, and uplift the mood. It also prevents mould and damp-related respiratory discomfort that are common in monsoon months.  Mixing a pinch of turmeric in a spoon of honey and consuming it in the morning can strengthen your immune response. Both ingredients are natural antibiotics and help fight inflammation, throat irritation, and viral infections.  Cold, oily, or deep-fried foods aggravate Kapha and dampen digestive fire, leading to sluggish digestion, colds, and sore throats. Stick to freshly cooked, warm meals with minimal oil to stay light and energised.  Incorporating simple, time-tested Ayurvedic hacks can help keep the body strong, the mind calm, and the immune system resilient throughout the damp season.

https://doctor.ndtv.com/heart/can-oral-health-issues-signal-heart-problems-8836721,Can Oral Health Issues Signal Heart Problems?,"Updated: Jul 7, 2025 03:03 IST","Oral health issues can be early warning signs of heart problems. Research has increasingly shown a strong link between poor oral hygiene and cardiovascular conditions such as heart disease, clogged arteries, and stroke. The connection lies in inflammation, bacteria from infected gums can enter the bloodstream, triggering inflammation in blood vessels and increasing the risk of plaque buildup in the arteries. Read on as we share a list of oral health issues that could signify heart issues.   Chronic gum inflammation, especially periodontitis, is closely linked with heart disease. The same bacteria causing gum disease can enter the bloodstream, contribute to arterial plaque buildup, and increase the risk of heart attack or stroke. If your gums are swollen, red, or bleeding frequently, it may signal both oral and cardiovascular inflammation.  While often caused by poor oral hygiene or food, persistent bad breath can also result from gum disease or oral infections, both of which are connected to cardiovascular health risks. The sulfur-producing bacteria involved in halitosis may also increase systemic inflammation affecting the heart.  Losing adult teeth without physical trauma may indicate advanced gum disease, which can be a predictor of heart issues. The inflammation and bone loss causing tooth mobility often reflect underlying systemic inflammation, which may also be harming the arteries.  Frequent gum bleeding, especially during brushing or flossing, is an early sign of gingivitis or periodontitis. This chronic inflammation can contribute to atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries) by increasing inflammatory markers in the blood.  Recurrent sores or pus-filled abscesses in the mouth could point to uncontrolled infection. When these infections become systemic, they can trigger an immune response that raises your heart disease risk by affecting blood vessel function.  Saliva protects the mouth from harmful bacteria. Persistent dry mouth can lead to an imbalance of bacteria, promoting tooth decay and gum disease. This bacterial imbalance and subsequent inflammation can have ripple effects on heart health, particularly in people with existing cardiovascular conditions.  Gum recession exposes the roots of teeth and often accompanies periodontitis. It's a physical sign of tissue breakdown due to inflammation, which, when systemic, is a known contributor to heart disease.  Pain in the jaw, especially radiating to the left, can sometimes mimic dental issues but may actually signal angina (restricted blood flow to the heart) or an impending heart attack. If not linked to any dental issue, this kind of pain should be evaluated urgently.  Untreated tooth infections can lead to bacteria entering the bloodstream and causing endocarditis, an infection of the heart lining. Chronic infections may also cause inflammation throughout the body, putting additional stress on cardiovascular systems.  An unusually pale or bluish tongue can indicate poor circulation, possibly linked to heart issues. While not specific to oral disease, such symptoms, especially if paired with fatigue or chest discomfort, should not be ignored as they may reflect reduced oxygenated blood flow from a weakened heart.  Therefore, symptoms like persistent gum bleeding, bad breath, or tooth infections shouldn't be ignored, as they may reflect deeper systemic issues, including potential heart complications.

The path to spiritual enlightenment is often paved with good intentions, but what happens when the pursuit of higher consciousness becomes a tool for arrogance? When spiritual practices and teachings are used to fuel the ego rather than transcend it, spiritual narcissism can take root. This phenomenon can be both captivating and toxic, leaving those around them feeling drained, confused, and even spiritually wounded. In a post shared on Instagram, fitness coach Luke Coutinho explained the meaning of spiritual narcissism. He wrote, ""A spiritual narcissist is someone who uses spiritual or religious beliefs and practices to boost their ego, gain power, control, or admiration, and often to feel superior to others. Unlike genuine spirituality, which emphasises humility, empathy, and connection, spiritual narcissism is marked by self-centeredness disguised as enlightenment."" While probiotic supplements can help, long-term gut health is better supported through natural and consistent practices. Cycling isn't just fun or nostalgic. It's a practical, low-cost, and highly effective way to improve your overall well-being. Here's why you should consider pedalling more often. The fitness coach added that spiritual narcissism is not the same as narcissistic personality disorder (NPD), which is a clinical diagnosis. It is rather a ""pattern of behaviour that can occur in anyone, especially in spiritual or religious contexts."" A post shared by Luke Coutinho - Official (@luke_coutinho)  Traits to identify a spiritual narcissist 1. Superiority complex
They act as if they are more spiritually advanced, looking down on others who don't share their beliefs or practices. For example, they might criticise you for not following their specific spiritual diet or meditation routine, claiming it's essential for health or enlightenment. 2. Attention-seeking behaviour
They constantly highlight their spiritual achievements (e.g., posting about meditation retreats or spiritual experiences on social media) to gain admiration. They may dominate spiritual gatherings, needing to be the centre of attention. 3. Lack of empathy masked as detachment
They dismiss others' emotions, telling them to “let go” or “rise above” feelings. They show little genuine compassion instead of offering understanding and support. 4. Manipulation using spiritual language
They use spiritual jargon or concepts to control or justify harmful actions, such as shaming others for not following their advice or claiming divine authority. 5. Hypocrisy and resistance to accountability
They preach humility or compassion but act arrogantly and reject criticism. They may get defensive or angry when challenged spiritually, claiming their spiritual status exempts them. What can you do? 1. Limit interactions and clearly communicate what is acceptable. Be firm yet respectful. 
2. Stay calm and avoid reacting to their provocations or attempts to make you feel inferior. Focus on your own path and your beliefs, taking advice from those who respect and understand you.
3. Seek support, trust your instincts and avoid vulnerable settings. Be cautious in spiritual or wellness groups where narcissists may exploit seekers. 
4. Never allow a spiritual narcissist to demean or control, manipulate you in a relationship, work, business or love. Keep these pointers in mind to stray clear of spiritual narcissists.

https://doctor.ndtv.com/living-healthy/not-sure-if-you-have-lactose-intolerance-look-out-for-these-symptoms-8824175,Not Sure If You Have Lactose Intolerance? Look Out For These Symptoms,"Updated: Jul 4, 2025 03:27 IST","Lactose intolerance is a common digestive condition where the body is unable to fully digest lactose, the natural sugar found in milk and dairy products. This occurs when the small intestine doesn't produce enough of the enzyme lactase, which is needed to break down lactose. As a result, undigested lactose ferments in the colon, causing uncomfortable symptoms. If someone is unsure whether they have lactose intolerance, certain symptoms especially after consuming dairy, can serve as helpful indicators. Recognising and tracking these symptoms can assist in identifying the condition and guiding dietary changes or seeking medical advice. Keep reading as we discuss signs that might indicate you have lactose intolerance.  These alternatives cater not only to those with lactose intolerance but also to those seeking vegan, plant-based options or those with dairy allergies. Lets explore eight great milk alternatives that can easily replace cows milk in your diet. Nutritionist Lovneet Batra highlights three important things that you must know while buying dairy.  One of the most common signs of lactose intolerance is abdominal bloating. After consuming milk or dairy, you might notice your stomach feeling full, tight, or swollen. This is due to the fermentation of undigested lactose in the colon, which produces gas and discomfort.  Frequent loose stools shortly after eating dairy products may point to lactose intolerance. Since the body can't break down lactose properly, it pulls water into the intestines, resulting in watery bowel movements.  Cramping or sharp abdominal pain often follows dairy consumption in people with lactose intolerance. These cramps can range from mild to severe and usually appear within 30 minutes to two hours of eating or drinking dairy.  Flatulence is a common but often embarrassing symptom. The buildup of hydrogen and other gases during lactose fermentation in the colon can cause increased gas, leading to pressure, discomfort, and sometimes audible symptoms.  Feeling nauseated after consuming dairy could indicate lactose intolerance. In some cases, individuals might even feel close to vomiting, especially when large amounts of lactose are consumed on an empty stomach.  Hyperactive bowel sounds or gurgling noises, especially after eating dairy, are caused by excessive gas and fluid in the intestines, signalling digestive distress associated with lactose intolerance.  An urgent need to go to the bathroom soon after consuming dairy could be a red flag. The combination of cramping, bloating, and diarrhoea often creates an intense, immediate need for a bowel movement.  Though less common, some people with lactose intolerance experience constipation instead of diarrhoea. The altered digestion and gut motility from incomplete lactose breakdown can slow down bowel movements for some.  Some people report feeling unusually tired or mentally foggy after dairy consumption. While not a classic digestive symptom, this may be linked to systemic inflammation or a body-wide response to the gut imbalance.  Although not always directly caused by lactose intolerance, skin issues like acne, rashes, or eczema-like symptoms sometimes flare up in people who react poorly to dairy. These signs might indicate inflammation linked to poor lactose digestion or a dairy sensitivity.  If you notice a consistent pattern of these symptoms after eating dairy, it's wise to consult a healthcare provider or try a short-term dairy elimination followed by a reintroduction to see if symptoms reappear.

These methods are rooted in understanding how to manage time, focus deeply, and retain information effectively. Tips such as active recall, spaced repetition, proper sleep, and strategic revision schedules are scientifically proven to improve learning outcomes. These habits not only help in mastering subjects efficiently but also reduce stress and boost confidence, ultimately leading to better exam performance. In this article, we share a list of tips intelligent students use to score well.   Top students begin preparing well before exams. They break the syllabus into manageable chunks and create a study calendar. Early preparation allows time to revisit difficult topics and reduces last-minute panic, improving retention and confidence.  Instead of passive reading, they test themselves frequently using flashcards, practice questions, or by explaining concepts aloud. This technique strengthens memory and highlights areas that need more attention.  Smart learners don't cram. They revisit material at increasing intervals using tools like Anki or spaced revision apps. This method taps into the brain's natural forgetting curve to reinforce long-term memory.  Rather than memorising blindly, intelligent students aim to understand core concepts. This helps them apply knowledge to a variety of questions, including tricky or analytical ones that test comprehension.  Solving previous years' papers and sample questions helps in familiarising with exam patterns and time constraints. It also identifies weak areas and boosts exam-taking confidence.  They study in focused 25-minute intervals followed by short breaks. This keeps their mind fresh and focused, enhances productivity, and prevents mental fatigue.  Smart students revise regularly, not just before exams. Weekly reviews help reinforce key ideas and prevent the buildup of forgotten material, ensuring they're always exam-ready.  They prioritise sleep, hydration, and balanced meals. Adequate rest sharpens memory, improves concentration, and supports better problem-solving during exams.  They create distraction-free environments and use digital tools like noise-cancelling headphones, study apps, or timers. This promotes deeper concentration and helps maintain study discipline.  Intelligent students develop a growth mindset and practice stress-reducing habits like journaling, deep breathing, or light exercise. Staying calm under pressure enhances focus and improves exam performance.  By combining these smart techniques with consistent effort, students not only score higher but also retain knowledge more meaningfully, which benefits them well beyond exams.

Constipation can cause discomfort, bloating, gas and cramps. Various factors can contribute to constipation, including dehydration, low fibre intake, lack of physical activity, certain medications, and medical conditions. Understanding the underlying causes is essential for effective management. One of the most immediate ways to alleviate constipation is through dietary changes. Certain foods, particularly those with high fibre content can promote bowel regularity and provide quick relief. Here, we have some foods that can help you relieve constipation effectively. In this article, we explore the best foods that can help relieve constipation naturally and promote a healthy digestive system. Since digestion slows down during sleep, adopting healthy habits before bedtime can help stimulate bowel movements the next morning. High-fibre foods promote healthy digestion, add bulk to the stool and promote bowel regularity. Vegetables like broccoli, carrots, and Brussels sprouts are great choices. Fruits such as apples, pears, and berries are also rich in fibre, particularly when consumed with the skin. Beans and legumes, including lentils, chickpeas, and black beans, are also excellent sources of soluble fibre. Whole grain products like oats, brown rice, and whole grain bread contain fibre. They may help enhance the bulk of the stool and stimulate bowel movement. Some fruits contain mild laxative properties like prunes and dried plums. They contain sorbitol, a sugar alcohol that attracts water into the intestines, promoting easier bowel movements. Additionally, figs and kiwi can also help due to their high fibre content and natural enzymes. Almonds, walnuts, flaxseeds and chia seeds are rich in fibre and healthy fats. Including a handful of nuts or a mix of seeds in your diet to support healthy digestion. Drinking enough water helps prevent and relieve constipation. Staying hydrated helps soften the stool, making it easier to pass. Herbal teas, particularly those containing ginger or peppermint, can also aid digestion. In addition to these dietary tips, exercising regularly helps promote digestion and stimulates digestive function. Disclaimer: This content including advice provides generic information only.

https://doctor.ndtv.com/living-healthy/are-10-000-steps-a-day-enough-lets-separate-facts-from-fiction-8819250,"Are 10,000 Steps A Day Enough? Let's Separate Facts From Fiction","Updated: Jul 3, 2025 05:05 IST","The idea that walking 10,000 steps a day is the golden standard for health has become widely popular, but it's not entirely rooted in science. Originally stemming from a 1960s Japanese marketing campaign, the 10,000-step goal was more of a catchy slogan than a scientifically proven benchmark. While walking 10,000 steps can definitely improve cardiovascular health, aid weight management, and enhance mood, it may not be necessary or appropriate for everyone. Some people may benefit from fewer steps with higher intensity, while others may need more depending on their fitness goals. Read on as we discuss the common facts and myths surrounding walking 10,000 steps.  This article delves into the ten leading causes of death in India, providing insights into each and highlighting the importance of addressing these health concerns. Yoga Poses For Winter Mornings: In this article, we'll explore ten yoga poses to do every winter morning, helping you stay fit and mentally rejuvenated throughout the winter season.  The 10,000-step goal isn't a one-size-fits-all requirement. People with different ages, lifestyles, and health conditions might need more or fewer steps to maintain or improve health. Some studies show benefits even with 6,000–8,000 steps, especially in older adults.  Regular walking whether it's 6,000, 8,000, or 10,000 steps, can lower the risk of heart disease, diabetes, and certain cancers. It also improves blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and insulin sensitivity over time.  You don't need to walk all 10,000 steps in a single session. Accumulating steps throughout the day like using stairs, taking short walks, or pacing during calls, has the same health benefits when spread out.  Daily steps, regardless of the exact number, are linked to better mood, reduced anxiety, and improved cognitive function. Even brief walks during a stressful day can positively impact mental well-being.  While step count is useful, intensity also matters. A brisk 30-minute walk can have more cardiovascular benefits than a slow-paced 10,000 steps. Including moderate to vigorous movement improves heart and lung health more effectively.  Studies show that walking just 7,000–8,000 steps per day can significantly lower mortality risk, especially in adults over 40. It's more important to stay consistent than to chase a specific number.  Other activities like cycling, swimming, strength training, and yoga may not add to your step count but still offer great health benefits. A well-rounded fitness plan includes more than just walking.  For many people, having a daily step goal serves as a motivational tool. Fitness trackers and step counters help build accountability and promote healthier habits over time, even if the goal varies per person.  Health is about consistency, not perfection. Missing the mark occasionally won't undo your progress. It's better to focus on moving regularly throughout the week than stressing over a single day's step count.  Regular walking, especially when combined with good nutrition and sleep, can support weight management and improve energy levels. It's a low-impact, sustainable way to stay active and burn calories.  Understanding the facts and myths around this number helps tailor fitness routines to individual needs.   Disclaimer: This content including advice provides generic information only.

What Is It And How Does It Work?,"Updated: Jul 2, 2025 10:41 IST"," Intravenous (IV) therapy is a medical technique in which health professionals use an IV to deliver fluids, medications, and nutrients into a patient's bloodstream through a vein. While topical and oral medication may take time to react, this method provides immediate treatment, ensuring that the substances reach the body quickly and effectively. IV therapy is performed by a trained healthcare professional. It is usually performed to treat severe dehydration and nutritional deficiencies. IV is also used to manage health conditions and pain by administering medication. Nowadays, IVs are also used for beauty treatments. IV therapy is usually considered safe when performed under medical supervision. It can be beneficial for a variety of conditions, including dehydration, nutrient deficiencies, and the need for rapid medication delivery. However, like any medical procedure, it does carry some risks, such as infection at the insertion site, phlebitis (inflammation of the vein), and fluid overload in certain patients. Also, it can be dangerous when performed without any medical assistance. Vitamin intravenous (IV) therapy is used to directly infuse vitamins into the bloodstream. Over the past few years, it has gained huge popularity, especially after endorsements from celebrities. They're also advertised to help in sports recovery. A thin catheter is inserted into a vein, usually in the arm or hand. This catheter is then connected to an IV bag containing the prescribed solution. The flow rate of the solution can be adjusted to ensure that the patient receives the appropriate dosage over a specific period. Overall, IV therapy is safe and effective. However, it is associated with several potential dangers. Also, it should always be performed only when prescribed by your doctor.

https://doctor.ndtv.com/living-healthy/haircare-tips-try-these-homemade-remedies-to-fight-frizziness-this-monsoon-season-8814679,Haircare Tips: Try These Homemade Remedies To Fight Frizziness This Monsoon Season,"Updated: Jul 2, 2025 07:45 IST","Frizziness is very common during the monsoon season due to the high humidity levels in the air. Moisture in the atmosphere causes hair to absorb excess water, swell up, and lose its smooth structure leading to frizz, puffiness, and lack of manageability. Additionally, rainwater can strip away natural oils from the scalp and hair, making it dry and more prone to breakage. While commercial products are available, many people find effective and safer relief from natural, homemade remedies that nourish the hair, lock in moisture, and restore shine. Below we share a list of homemade remedies to help reduce frizziness for monsoon.   Mix 2 tablespoons of coconut oil with 2 tablespoons of fresh aloe vera gel. Apply this to your hair from roots to ends and leave it on for 30–45 minutes before washing. Coconut oil deeply nourishes and aloe vera soothes the scalp while sealing moisture into hair strands, reducing frizz.  Mash 1 ripe banana and mix it with 1 tablespoon of honey. Apply the paste evenly to damp hair and leave it on for 20–30 minutes. Bananas are rich in natural oils and potassium that soften hair, while honey acts as a humectant to retain moisture.  Combine half a cup of plain yogurt with 1 tablespoon of olive oil. After shampooing, use it as a conditioner. Yogurt provides protein and olive oil hydrates dry strands, smoothing out frizz naturally.  Mix 2 tablespoons of apple cider vinegar with 1 cup of water and use it as a final rinse after shampooing. This balances the hair's pH and smooths the cuticle, reducing frizz and adding natural shine.  Beat 1 egg with 1 tablespoon of olive oil. Apply this protein-rich mixture to your hair, leave it for 20 minutes, then wash off with a mild shampoo. This helps strengthen strands and tame frizz.  Soak 2 tablespoons of fenugreek seeds overnight and grind into a paste the next morning. Apply it to your scalp and hair for 30 minutes. Fenugreek is rich in lecithin which hydrates hair and fights frizziness naturally.  Mash half an avocado and mix with 2 tablespoons of curd. Apply this creamy mixture to your hair and let it sit for 30 minutes. Avocados are rich in vitamins and fatty acids that nourish dry, frizzy hair, while curd adds softness.  Save the water used for boiling rice and let it cool. Pour into a spray bottle and use it on damp hair after a wash. Rich in amino acids, rice water helps smoothen hair texture and reduce puffiness caused by humidity.  Warm some amla oil and gently massage it into your scalp once a week. Amla strengthens hair from the roots and helps retain moisture, preventing dryness and frizz.  Try these homemade remedies to reduce frizziness in the monsoon.

https://doctor.ndtv.com/nutrition/9-mental-health-issues-nutrient-deficiencies-it-could-indicate-8812494,9 Mental Health Issues & Nutrient Deficiencies It Could Indicate,"Updated: Jul 2, 2025 02:09 IST","Mental health issues can indeed be caused or worsened by nutrient deficiencies. The brain requires a range of vitamins, minerals, and amino acids to function properly, and when these are lacking, it can disrupt mood regulation, cognitive performance, and emotional resilience. A deficiency in these key nutrients can manifest as depression, anxiety, irritability, fatigue, or even more severe psychiatric symptoms. Addressing such deficiencies through diet or supplements, under medical supervision, can often lead to significant improvement in mental health. Keep reading as we share common nutreitn deficiencies and mental health issues it can cause.   Low levels of vitamin D have been strongly linked to symptoms of depression. Vitamin D helps regulate mood and ward off inflammation in the brain. Without enough sunlight or dietary sources, individuals may experience chronic sadness, fatigue, and lack of interest in activities.  Magnesium plays a key role in regulating the body's stress-response system. When deficient, the nervous system becomes more reactive, leading to heightened feelings of anxiety, restlessness, and irritability. Magnesium also helps with sleep, which can indirectly influence anxiety levels.  Iron is vital for oxygen transport to the brain and energy production. Its deficiency, especially in women, can result in fatigue, low motivation, brain fog, and even mood swings. It may mimic symptoms of depression or burnout.  Omega-3 fatty acids are essential for brain health and neurotransmitter regulation. Low levels are associated with increased mood instability, irritability, and even bipolar symptoms. Including fatty fish, flaxseeds, or supplements can help stabilise mood.  The B-vitamins are critical for the synthesis of neurotransmitters like serotonin, dopamine, and GABA. A deficiency in B6, B9 (folate), or B12 can result in poor concentration, mental fatigue, irritability, and depressive symptoms.  Both calcium and potassium play a role in muscle and nerve function. When deficient, nerve signals may misfire, leading to symptoms like palpitations, muscle spasms, and panic attacks. Replenishing these minerals can help reduce these physical triggers.  Sleep quality is deeply affected by mineral imbalances. Zinc and magnesium are needed to maintain healthy sleep patterns and regulate melatonin production. Their deficiencies may lead to insomnia, restless sleep, or frequent nighttime waking.  Selenium is a powerful antioxidant that protects the brain from oxidative stress. A deficiency may contribute to heightened anxiety, obsessive thoughts, and even symptoms related to OCD, due to its impact on thyroid function and mental clarity.  Vitamin E helps protect brain cells from oxidative stress. Inadequate levels may accelerate cognitive decline, increase forgetfulness, and contribute to neurodegenerative conditions, especially in older adults.  Watch out for these signs and nutrient deficiencies to ensure better overall health.  Disclaimer: This content including advice provides generic information only.

These include excessive screen time, lack of outdoor activity, poor nutrition, uncorrected refractive errors, and genetics. However, developing healthy daily habits can help support and protect your child's vision as they grow. Encouraging regular eye care, balanced diets, screen-time breaks, and eye-friendly routines can greatly reduce the risk of long-term vision issues and strain, ensuring their eyes stay healthy and functional. Keep reading as we share a list of daily habits to add to your kid's routine to reduce risk of vision problems.  This article explores some of the common eye problems in children, their symptoms, and the importance of regular eye check-ups for maintaining good vision health. World Sight Day 2023: Optometrists and ophthalmologists properly check the vision, alignment of eyes and overall eye health of your child.  Prolonged exposure to screens like TVs, tablets, smartphones, and computers can lead to digital eye strain and even myopia (nearsightedness). Set time limits for screen usage and encourage breaks every 20 minutes using the ""20-20-20 rule"".  Spending at least 1-2 hours outdoors daily has been shown to reduce the risk of myopia in children. Natural light and long-distance focusing help develop healthy vision, so outdoor games, cycling, or nature walks are highly beneficial.  Ensure your child reads or does homework in well-lit environments. Poor lighting can strain the eyes and lead to headaches and fatigue. Natural daylight or bright but soft artificial lighting is best for reducing eye stress.  Teach your child to keep books or screens at least 12–16 inches away from their eyes. Holding items too close can contribute to eye strain and increase the risk of developing nearsightedness.  Simple eye exercises like blinking frequently, rolling the eyes, or shifting focus from near to far can strengthen the eye muscles and reduce fatigue especially helpful after study or screen time.  Foods rich in vitamins A, C, E, zinc, and omega-3 fatty acids (like carrots, leafy greens, sweet potatoes, eggs, nuts, and fish) help support healthy eye function and reduce the risk of vision loss.  Adequate sleep is vital for eye health. Lack of rest can cause dry, tired eyes and poor visual performance. Stick to a consistent bedtime routine to allow their eyes and brain to recharge properly.  Dry eyes can result from dehydration. Ensure your child drinks enough water throughout the day to keep their eyes moisturised and comfortable, especially in dry or air-conditioned environments.  Kids often rub their eyes with dirty hands, which can lead to infections like conjunctivitis. Encourage clean hands, discourage eye rubbing, and teach the importance of not sharing towels or eye drops.  Many vision problems are silent in the early stages. Routine eye exams can help detect and address issues like lazy eye, strabismus, or uncorrected refractive errors early, boosting both vision and academic performance.  By integrating these small but powerful habits into your child's daily life, you can foster not just better eye health but also improved concentration, learning, and confidence.

The speedster is quickly making gains in the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2025 top wicket-takers' charts, while also turning the season around for MI since his return to the T20 league. Bumrah missed the first few matches of the franchise, but since his return, not much has gone wrong for theHardik Pandya-led side. In fact, MI have won 6 of the last 7 matches that Bumrah has been a part of.
The consistency with which Bumrah bowls terrifies every single opponent. His talent, coupled with the approach towards the game, truly makes him an elite athlete, that arguably no one can match in the game at present. This is the reason Australian cricket greatAdam Gilchristdecided to draw comparisons between Bumrah and the GOAT Sir Donald Bradman.
""He's maybe the best bowler, fast bowler of all time. When you start stacking up the statistics and the varying conditions that he has to go out and execute those skills in, I guess you look at Sir Donald Bradman's numbers compared to his peers and he's just so far ahead, so I think Bumrah is sort of in that category across all the different variations that you get in conditions and pitches that you've got to bowl on. He's significantly further ahead than the peers around him, so that tells you we are truly watching greatness,"" Gilchrist said during a discussion on Cricbuzz.
Gilchrist was even asked if the Australians were ever intimidated by an Indian pacer in the past, the way they were in the 2024-25 Border-Gavaskar Trophy. His answer was a clear no.
""A seamer from India, consistently throughout, particularly the series that we just saw in the summer, back home in the Australian summer, no, I don't think so,"" Gilchrist said when he was asked whether Australians were intimidated and afraid of a bowler from India like they were against Jasprit Bumrah.
Former India spinnerMurali Kartik, who was also a part of the panel discussion on Thursday, called Bumrah a 'national treasure' for the country.
""He's a national treasure, I think at the moment for us a lot, whoever follows cricket and wants India to do well, during the BGT, I think all of us were wishing that he could bowl from both ends. India looked a different side and he looked a different bowler against Australia, he is, look, one of the things which I felt with Bumrah over the period of time is that he acclimatises to any pitch very quickly and I think many bowlers have a certain length that they bowl, but he doesn't have a certain length, he bowls the length which is required on that surface and that's his greatness, the oddity of his action,"" he said.

During the 14th over of the innings, Abhishek was struck on his shoes by a yorker and although the umpire was not interested in the LBW appeal, GT went for a review.

Gujarat Titans roared back to winning ways with a 38-run mauling of Sunrisers Hyderabad after Prasidh Krishna's outstanding bowling complemented Shubman Gill and Jos Buttler's explosive half-centuries in the Indian Premier League on Friday.
The result meant SRH are all but out of the playoffs race, even as GT boosted their prospects.
The trio of Gill, Buttler and Sai Sudharsan fired in unison to propel GT to 224 for six.

Kohli then took centre stage in his 36-ball knock which witnessed a fan breaching security to touch the celebrated Indian batsman's feet -- a common scene in IPL matches across seasons.
The former India captain set up the chase in a 95-run opening stand with England's Phil Salt, who smashed 56, as Bengaluru achieved the target with 22 balls to spare.
Liam Livingstonefinished off with a six and four in his unbeaten 15 after debutant skipper Rajat Patidar hit a 16-ball 34.
""There was pressure, but it was a good day for me,"" said Patidar. ""Hope for more such days.""
On having Kohli by his side, Patidar said, ""It's a great opportunity for me to learn from one of the great players of the game.""

Rauf produced a one-handed stunner during the third T20I of the 5-match series against New Zealand on Friday to send opening batter Fin Allen packing early in the game.
Shaheen Afridibowled a fuller deliver on the leg stump to Allen, who tried to flick the ball past the short-fine leg fielder. Haris, however, diving towards his right-hand side, turned into a superman as he plucked the ball in dramatic fashion. Rauf's own reaction suggested that he himself couldn't believe what had happened.

Later in the match, New Zealand batterMark Chapmanstruck a blistering 94 a the hosts scored 204 against Pakistan and moved into a strong position to clinch the five-match series.
Chapman dominated after New Zealand were asked to bat, taking advantage of the small Eden Park boundaries as he tallied 11 fours and four sixes from just 44 balls faced.
The left-hander fell agonisingly short of a second T20 century when he mistimed a slower ball from Shaheen Shah Afridi and was caught at short third man.
The rest of the home side's batsmen struggled to get going, aside from captainMichael Bracewell's 31, as they were dismissed from the penultimate ball.
Experienced seamer Haris Rauf bowled Bracewell and finished with Pakistan's best figures of 3-29.
Leg-spinnerAbrar Ahmedand seamerAbbas Afridi, who both missed Tuesday's game two loss in Dunedin, justified their recalls by taking two wickets each.
New Zealand made one change, recalling Kyle Jamieson in place of fellow seamer Zak Foulkes.
Jamieson took three wickets when New Zealand won the opening match by nine wickets in Christchurch.

Swastik, the 20-year-old who rose to fame with a hat-trick of centuries in the UP T20 League in 2023 and has played some matches for Uttar Pradesh in domestic cricket, has been the subject of many hilarious memes on social media because of his repeated presence around Virat. He is often seen carrying water for Virat and cracking jokes and pranks with him on and off the field.
Virat, however, said that he would like to have wicketkeeper Jitesh Sharma as his roommate. He called the batter ""funny"" and someone who has a lot of ""mischief"" in his eyes. He also appreciated the keeper, who has 121 runs in seven innings so far for RCB, for his ""street-smart"" cricket.
""But one guy I think is really funny, but he has not opened up with me properly, is Jitesh [Sharma]. I want to see that really fun, raw side of him because I can see it in his eyes; he has that mischief about him.

The original estimated budget for the renovation of PCB venues in Karachi, Lahore and Rawalpindi was 12.3 billion Pakistani rupees (approx. Rs 383 crore), which has now gone up to 18 billion rupees (approx. Rs 561 crore). The tournament begins february 19 with India playing all their matches in Dubai from February 20.
The PCB's Board of Governors (BOG) has approved the additional cost. The board's chief financial officer has also been given approval for an overdraft of 3 to 6 billion rupees (if required) for the current fiscal year budget.
According to a report in the 'Dawn' newspaper, the CFO told the BOG at a meeting in December that considering the anticipated overall future cash flow requirements, there is a strong possibility that the PCB will require external cash flow support for the foreseeable future.
The report, quoting documents from the BOG meeting, said the management has agreed, in principle, to secure external cash overdraft facilities in the amount of three billion to six billion to support any unexpected additional funding requirements.
The documents also reveal that in the last fiscal year, the board had reserves of approximately 26 billion rupees.
But the board had to sell out the broadcast rights and others for the next three years (2024-26) for 1.70 billion rupees, which was less than its reserve price of around billion plus initially quoted by the PCB.
The PCB will also generate revenues after this year's Pakistan Super League by adding two more teams to the league while its 10-year contracts with the existing franchises also ends this year and can be renegotiated.
Since its creation the PCB has been a self-supporting sports body in Pakistan not dependent on any funding from government and has never complained of any serious financial crunch.

India finished runners-up in the previous edition in 2017 after losing the final to Pakistan. The Champions Trophy 2025 also presents a chance to the Indian cricket team for redeeming themselves after a 3-1 loss to Australia, which drew much criticism. The build-up to the Champions Trophy 2025 has been good for Indian cricket team after a clean sweep against England in an ODI series at home. The Champions Trophy will also be the first mega event where BCCI's new guidelines regarding travelling family members, personal staff will come into effect in a stringent way.
According to a report inCricbuzz, the BCCI is absolutely strict about implementing the guidelines. A formal SOP has been shared formally with all the players on travel, nets, luggage allowances, and accompanying family members. The report added players were told during the recent third ODI in Ahmedabad that the disciplinary guidelines were non-negotiable.
""There is no going back on this and the players have made aware that the BCCI is very serious about the SOPs,"" the report quoted a source as saying.
One clause of the guidelines say: ""All players are required to stay for the entire duration of scheduled practice sessions and travel together to and from the venue. This rule ensures commitment and fosters a strong work ethic within the team."" According to the above-mentioned report, ""violation of this rule could be seriously viewed by the BCCI.""
A report in news agency PTI said if there is any exception, the players will have to bear the expenses.
""If anything changes then it is different but as of now, the players are unlikely to be accompanied by their wives or partners for this tour. One of the senior players had enquired about it and he was told that the policy decision will be followed,"" a senior BCCI source said.
""Since the tour is of less than one month, families won't be accompanying the players. But if exceptions are made, I think that individual will have to bear the full expenses as BCCI won't be covering any cost.""
The senior official said that most of the rules have already been enforced by the BCCI.
""If you look at it, already no player can ask for a private vehicle to come for practice. All state units have been notified. Similarly once the players assembled in Kolkata (for the T20I series against England) and Nagpur (for the ODI series against the same side), the team has travelled together,"" he confirmed.

Accordingly, the personal secretary of a member of the coaching staff, who was regularly seen staying at the team hotel, now stays at a different facility even though he has been seen at every venue during the England home series.

The speedster is quickly making gains in the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2025 top wicket-takers' charts, while also turning the season around for MI since his return to the T20 league. Bumrah missed the first few matches of the franchise, but since his return, not much has gone wrong for theHardik Pandya-led side. In fact, MI have won 6 of the last 7 matches that Bumrah has been a part of.
The consistency with which Bumrah bowls terrifies every single opponent. His talent, coupled with the approach towards the game, truly makes him an elite athlete, that arguably no one can match in the game at present. This is the reason Australian cricket greatAdam Gilchristdecided to draw comparisons between Bumrah and the GOAT Sir Donald Bradman.
""He's maybe the best bowler, fast bowler of all time. When you start stacking up the statistics and the varying conditions that he has to go out and execute those skills in, I guess you look at Sir Donald Bradman's numbers compared to his peers and he's just so far ahead, so I think Bumrah is sort of in that category across all the different variations that you get in conditions and pitches that you've got to bowl on. He's significantly further ahead than the peers around him, so that tells you we are truly watching greatness,"" Gilchrist said during a discussion on Cricbuzz.
Gilchrist was even asked if the Australians were ever intimidated by an Indian pacer in the past, the way they were in the 2024-25 Border-Gavaskar Trophy. His answer was a clear no.
""A seamer from India, consistently throughout, particularly the series that we just saw in the summer, back home in the Australian summer, no, I don't think so,"" Gilchrist said when he was asked whether Australians were intimidated and afraid of a bowler from India like they were against Jasprit Bumrah.
Former India spinnerMurali Kartik, who was also a part of the panel discussion on Thursday, called Bumrah a 'national treasure' for the country.
""He's a national treasure, I think at the moment for us a lot, whoever follows cricket and wants India to do well, during the BGT, I think all of us were wishing that he could bowl from both ends. India looked a different side and he looked a different bowler against Australia, he is, look, one of the things which I felt with Bumrah over the period of time is that he acclimatises to any pitch very quickly and I think many bowlers have a certain length that they bowl, but he doesn't have a certain length, he bowls the length which is required on that surface and that's his greatness, the oddity of his action,"" he said.

Virat Kohli opened the Indian Premier League season with an unbeaten 59 as he led Royal Challengers Bengaluru to a crushing seven-wicket win over champions Kolkata Knight Riders in the curtain-raiser on Saturday.
Bengaluru restricted hosts Kolkata to 174-8 despite a quickfire 56 from skipperAjinkya Rahaneat the iconic Eden Gardens in the lucrative T20 tournament.
Kohli then took centre stage in his 36-ball knock which witnessed a fan breaching security to touch the celebrated Indian batsman's feet -- a common scene in IPL matches across seasons.
The former India captain set up the chase in a 95-run opening stand with England's Phil Salt, who smashed 56, as Bengaluru achieved the target with 22 balls to spare.
Liam Livingstonefinished off with a six and four in his unbeaten 15 after debutant skipper Rajat Patidar hit a 16-ball 34.
""There was pressure, but it was a good day for me,"" said Patidar. ""Hope for more such days.""
On having Kohli by his side, Patidar said, ""It's a great opportunity for me to learn from one of the great players of the game.""

Later in the match, New Zealand batterMark Chapmanstruck a blistering 94 a the hosts scored 204 against Pakistan and moved into a strong position to clinch the five-match series.
Chapman dominated after New Zealand were asked to bat, taking advantage of the small Eden Park boundaries as he tallied 11 fours and four sixes from just 44 balls faced.
The left-hander fell agonisingly short of a second T20 century when he mistimed a slower ball from Shaheen Shah Afridi and was caught at short third man.
The rest of the home side's batsmen struggled to get going, aside from captainMichael Bracewell's 31, as they were dismissed from the penultimate ball.
Experienced seamer Haris Rauf bowled Bracewell and finished with Pakistan's best figures of 3-29.
Leg-spinnerAbrar Ahmedand seamerAbbas Afridi, who both missed Tuesday's game two loss in Dunedin, justified their recalls by taking two wickets each.
New Zealand made one change, recalling Kyle Jamieson in place of fellow seamer Zak Foulkes.
Jamieson took three wickets when New Zealand won the opening match by nine wickets in Christchurch.

Swastik, the 20-year-old who rose to fame with a hat-trick of centuries in the UP T20 League in 2023 and has played some matches for Uttar Pradesh in domestic cricket, has been the subject of many hilarious memes on social media because of his repeated presence around Virat. He is often seen carrying water for Virat and cracking jokes and pranks with him on and off the field.
Virat, however, said that he would like to have wicketkeeper Jitesh Sharma as his roommate. He called the batter ""funny"" and someone who has a lot of ""mischief"" in his eyes. He also appreciated the keeper, who has 121 runs in seven innings so far for RCB, for his ""street-smart"" cricket.
""But one guy I think is really funny, but he has not opened up with me properly, is Jitesh [Sharma]. I want to see that really fun, raw side of him because I can see it in his eyes; he has that mischief about him.

The GT skipper ended up having a heated chat with the umpires but Abhishek Sharma stepped between them and tried to calm him down.

The original estimated budget for the renovation of PCB venues in Karachi, Lahore and Rawalpindi was 12.3 billion Pakistani rupees (approx. Rs 383 crore), which has now gone up to 18 billion rupees (approx. Rs 561 crore). The tournament begins february 19 with India playing all their matches in Dubai from February 20.
The PCB's Board of Governors (BOG) has approved the additional cost. The board's chief financial officer has also been given approval for an overdraft of 3 to 6 billion rupees (if required) for the current fiscal year budget.
According to a report in the 'Dawn' newspaper, the CFO told the BOG at a meeting in December that considering the anticipated overall future cash flow requirements, there is a strong possibility that the PCB will require external cash flow support for the foreseeable future.
The report, quoting documents from the BOG meeting, said the management has agreed, in principle, to secure external cash overdraft facilities in the amount of three billion to six billion to support any unexpected additional funding requirements.
The documents also reveal that in the last fiscal year, the board had reserves of approximately 26 billion rupees.
But the board had to sell out the broadcast rights and others for the next three years (2024-26) for 1.70 billion rupees, which was less than its reserve price of around billion plus initially quoted by the PCB.
The PCB will also generate revenues after this year's Pakistan Super League by adding two more teams to the league while its 10-year contracts with the existing franchises also ends this year and can be renegotiated.
Since its creation the PCB has been a self-supporting sports body in Pakistan not dependent on any funding from government and has never complained of any serious financial crunch.

India finished runners-up in the previous edition in 2017 after losing the final to Pakistan. The Champions Trophy 2025 also presents a chance to the Indian cricket team for redeeming themselves after a 3-1 loss to Australia, which drew much criticism. The build-up to the Champions Trophy 2025 has been good for Indian cricket team after a clean sweep against England in an ODI series at home. The Champions Trophy will also be the first mega event where BCCI's new guidelines regarding travelling family members, personal staff will come into effect in a stringent way.
According to a report inCricbuzz, the BCCI is absolutely strict about implementing the guidelines. A formal SOP has been shared formally with all the players on travel, nets, luggage allowances, and accompanying family members. The report added players were told during the recent third ODI in Ahmedabad that the disciplinary guidelines were non-negotiable.
""There is no going back on this and the players have made aware that the BCCI is very serious about the SOPs,"" the report quoted a source as saying.
One clause of the guidelines say: ""All players are required to stay for the entire duration of scheduled practice sessions and travel together to and from the venue. This rule ensures commitment and fosters a strong work ethic within the team."" According to the above-mentioned report, ""violation of this rule could be seriously viewed by the BCCI.""
A report in news agency PTI said if there is any exception, the players will have to bear the expenses.
""If anything changes then it is different but as of now, the players are unlikely to be accompanied by their wives or partners for this tour. One of the senior players had enquired about it and he was told that the policy decision will be followed,"" a senior BCCI source said.
""Since the tour is of less than one month, families won't be accompanying the players. But if exceptions are made, I think that individual will have to bear the full expenses as BCCI won't be covering any cost.""
The senior official said that most of the rules have already been enforced by the BCCI.
""If you look at it, already no player can ask for a private vehicle to come for practice. All state units have been notified. Similarly once the players assembled in Kolkata (for the T20I series against England) and Nagpur (for the ODI series against the same side), the team has travelled together,"" he confirmed.

CSK were the first team to crash out of the playoffs race and former West Indies batter Darren Ganga once again questioned the decision to give the captaincy to Dhoni following an injury toRuturaj Gaikwad. During an interaction on ESPNCricinfo, Ganga did not hold back while discussing the CSK captaincy situation and questioned the franchise on their over-reliance on Dhoni and the lack of a proper transition plan.
“Is that not a high risk for a team if you're planning for next season, you're pegging your hopes on a player who's not playing competitive cricket between IPL seasons,” Ganga said.
“Isn't that putting yourself at a disadvantage based on that player's fitness and availability to play an entire season? You find yourself back at square one, where you will be searching for a captain, a man who is not part of the entire process of strategic planning and direction for a season. So I feel you're in that constant cycle of development and not progressing.”
Ganga conceded that Dhoni still deserves a place in the CSK playing XI before adding that the fact that he still holds captaincy ambitions can prove to be detrimental to the entire situation.
“Yes. I surely think with the big option of the fact that he's put himself forward and what we've seen from him as a wicketkeeper and a batter at the back end of innings, he can command himself on that team,” he said.
“But my biggest question is, should he be considered a captain in that squad when you 18 years from the start of him leading the side. We all agree theoretically that it's sport, it's cyclical, and leadership has a shelf life.”
“But I feel having a guy like Ruturaj Gaikwad and, in the past,Ravindra Jadejain that sort of unsettling situation where it seems that MS still has ambitions of captaincy is not a good situation to be in. I've been in that situation before. It is very unsettling for you when you know that there's someone behind you who still has ambitions. But it is being shown as though he is not interested,” he added.

Half-centuries by Shubman Gill and Jos Buttler saw Gujarat post a massive total of 224/6 in the first innings at the Narendra Modi Stadium. Despite Abhishek Sharma's 74-run fighting knock, there was not enough fight by the batters to chase it down, and they fizzled to 186/6.
Sunrisers have won only three of their 10 games so far this season, and their fate now depends on other fixtures going their way. However, Cummins believes that hope is still there for the franchise, given the mega auctions that took place in 2024, ensuring the core of the team will remain the same for years to follow.
“Our power-play with the bat wasn't too great. I was as guilty as anyone else. Probably let them get 20-30 extra runs. Maybe hang on to one or two catches. Again, I am guilty there. Chasing 200 looked a bit more realistic. They are class batters. They don't do anything outlandish. If you bowl bad balls, they just put them away.
“We probably dished out too many bad balls. It is a really good wicket. Going for 140 in the last 14 overs was good on the bowling part. Sharma batted nicely. Nitish at the end. Left a little too much and too late for the batters. We can cling to some hope. Big auction last year. The core of the group will be there for three years,” said Cummins during the post-game presentation on Friday.
With the win, Gujarat moved past Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) into second place in the points table courtesy of their superior run rate. RCB will take on Chennai Super Kings on Saturday in what could be a pivotal result for Gujarat Titans.

Prasidh once again excelled with the ball for GT, finishing with excellent figures of 2/19 in 4 overs. The only cause of concern for GT this evening came when Ishant limped off the ground after failing to complete the final over.
SRH, though, meant business at the start of their innings as Mohammed Siraj (2/33) went for 22 runs in his first two overs, while Ishant Sharma conceded 20 in his first two.
However, a spectacular catch in the deep by Rashid Khan ended Travis Head's innings after he covered a lot of ground to reach the ball, having run from deep square leg and then change his direction to judge it to perfection.
Ishan Kishan got out for 13 after consuming 17 balls, as the required rate went over 14.
Despite the presence of Abhishek and Heinrich in the middle for SRH, the match was already in GT's bag thanks to the asking rate that gone past 16.
Meanwhile, an upset Gill engaged in an animated chat with the two umpires over a review call involving Abhishek, who was seen trying to calm the GT captain.
Sent in to bat, Gujarat Titans skipper Gill got the innings underway with a flick off a loose Mohammed Shami delivery for a six.
Having conceded 11 runs in the first over, Shami looked off-colour as Sudharsan dispatched the seamer for five boundaries, including four on the trot.
SRH captain Pat Cummins brought himself into the attack, but the carnage continued as Gill launched into his opposite number, first greeting him with a cover drive and then playing an even better shot shot through the gap between mid-off and cover.
It was a forgettable start for Cummins as Gill smoked the Australian speedster for a maximum over deep mid-wicket to collect 17 from that over.
The best part of their game was that both Gill and Sudharsan were toying with the SRH bowlers without taking any risks and instead relied on class to get the runs.
GT amassed 82 runs in the power play, following which spin was introduced in the form of Zeeshan Ali and the leg-spinner gave his team a much-needed breakthrough by having Sudharsan caught by keeper Heinrich Klaasen off a googly.
In the company of Buttler, Gill continued at the same pace and reached his half-century with a beautiful drive through extra cover for a four, taking 25 balls to get to his fifty.
Buttler also looked in good nick and smashed Ansari straight down the ground for a six, and three balls later, the Englishman crossed 4000 runs in IPL.
Worse was in store for SRH as Cummins dropped Gill after Harshal Patel deceived the batter with a slower ball. Gill was on 66.
However, the GT captain was run out following a throw by Harshal at short fine-leg and Klaasen, instead of catching the ball deflected it onto the stumps.

The triumvirate ofShubman Gill,Sai SudharsanandJos Buttlerfired in unison with their explosive batting to propel Gujarat Titans to 224 for six against Sunrisers Hyderabad in the Indian Premier League in Ahmedabad on Friday.
Gill blazed away to a 38-ball 76, while Sudharsan chipped in with a breezy 23-ball 48 while forging an opening stand of 87 runs in just 6.5 overs, following which Buttler took GT past 200 with his 64 off 37 deliveries.
Jaydev Unadkat (3/35) picked up three wickets in the 20th over that went for 12 runs.
Sent in to bat, skipper Gill got the innings underway for GT when he flicked a loose Mohammed Shami delivery over deep square leg for a six.
Having conceded 11 runs in the first over, Shami looked off-colour as Sudharsan dispatched the seamer for five boundaries, including four on the trot.
SRH captain Pat Cummins brought himself into the attack, but the carnage continued as Gill launched into his opposite number, first greeting him with a cover drive and then playing an even better shot shot through the gap between mid-off and cover.
It was a forgettable start for Cummins as Gill smoked the Australian speedster for a maximum over deep mid-wicket to collect 17 from that over.
The best part of their game was that both Gill and Sudharsan were toying with the SRH bowlers without taking any risks and instead relied on class to get the runs.
GT amassed 82 runs in the power play, following which spin was introduced in the form of Zeeshan Ali and the leg-spinner gave his team a much-needed breakthrough by having Sudharsan caught by keeperHeinrich Klaasenoff a googly.
In the company of Buttler, Gill continued at the same pace and reached his half-century with a beautiful drive through extra cover for a four, taking 25 balls to get to his fifty.
Buttler also looked in good nick and smashed Ansari straight down the ground for a six, and three balls later, the Englishman crossed 4000 runs in IPL.
Worse was in store for SRH as Cummins dropped Gill afterHarshal Pateldeceived the batter with a slower ball. Gill was on 66.
However, the GT captain did not last long thereafter as he was run out following a throw by Harshal at short fine-leg and Klaasen, instead of catching the ball deflected it onto the stumps. The TV umpire took his time before ruling in favour of SRH.
Buttler then propped up GT with his power-hitting.

CSK were the first team to crash out of the playoffs race and former West Indies batter Darren Ganga once again questioned the decision to give the captaincy to Dhoni following an injury toRuturaj Gaikwad. During an interaction on ESPNCricinfo, Ganga did not hold back while discussing the CSK captaincy situation and questioned the franchise on their over-reliance on Dhoni and the lack of a proper transition plan.
“Is that not a high risk for a team if you're planning for next season, you're pegging your hopes on a player who's not playing competitive cricket between IPL seasons,” Ganga said.
“Isn't that putting yourself at a disadvantage based on that player's fitness and availability to play an entire season? You find yourself back at square one, where you will be searching for a captain, a man who is not part of the entire process of strategic planning and direction for a season. So I feel you're in that constant cycle of development and not progressing.”
Ganga conceded that Dhoni still deserves a place in the CSK playing XI before adding that the fact that he still holds captaincy ambitions can prove to be detrimental to the entire situation.
“Yes. I surely think with the big option of the fact that he's put himself forward and what we've seen from him as a wicketkeeper and a batter at the back end of innings, he can command himself on that team,” he said.
“But my biggest question is, should he be considered a captain in that squad when you 18 years from the start of him leading the side. We all agree theoretically that it's sport, it's cyclical, and leadership has a shelf life.”
“But I feel having a guy like Ruturaj Gaikwad and, in the past,Ravindra Jadejain that sort of unsettling situation where it seems that MS still has ambitions of captaincy is not a good situation to be in. I've been in that situation before. It is very unsettling for you when you know that there's someone behind you who still has ambitions. But it is being shown as though he is not interested,” he added.

Half-centuries by Shubman Gill and Jos Buttler saw Gujarat post a massive total of 224/6 in the first innings at the Narendra Modi Stadium. Despite Abhishek Sharma's 74-run fighting knock, there was not enough fight by the batters to chase it down, and they fizzled to 186/6.
Sunrisers have won only three of their 10 games so far this season, and their fate now depends on other fixtures going their way. However, Cummins believes that hope is still there for the franchise, given the mega auctions that took place in 2024, ensuring the core of the team will remain the same for years to follow.
“Our power-play with the bat wasn't too great. I was as guilty as anyone else. Probably let them get 20-30 extra runs. Maybe hang on to one or two catches. Again, I am guilty there. Chasing 200 looked a bit more realistic. They are class batters. They don't do anything outlandish. If you bowl bad balls, they just put them away.
“We probably dished out too many bad balls. It is a really good wicket. Going for 140 in the last 14 overs was good on the bowling part. Sharma batted nicely. Nitish at the end. Left a little too much and too late for the batters. We can cling to some hope. Big auction last year. The core of the group will be there for three years,” said Cummins during the post-game presentation on Friday.
With the win, Gujarat moved past Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) into second place in the points table courtesy of their superior run rate. RCB will take on Chennai Super Kings on Saturday in what could be a pivotal result for Gujarat Titans.

The win made GT's case further strong for a spot in the playoffs. It was a seventh win in 10 matches for the Shubman Gill-led side and it moved to the second spot in the table with 14 points to its credit. Mumbai Indians, who too have as many points to their credit, continue to hold the top spot on the basis of a better net run rate.
GT's Sai Sudharsan has taken the Orange Cap from MI's Suryakumar Yadav with 504 runs in 10 matches. Meanwhile, GT fast bowler Prasidh Krishna has taken the Purple Cap from RCB pacer Josh Hazlewood with 19 wickets in 10 games.
Gujarat Titans roared back to winning ways with a 38-run mauling of Sunrisers Hyderabad after Prasidh Krishna's outstanding bowling complemented Shubman Gill and Jos Buttler's explosive half-centuries in IPL 2025 at Ahmedabad on Friday.
The result meant SRH are all but out of the playoffs race, even as GT boosted their prospects.
The trio of Gill, Buttler and Sai Sudharsan fired in unison to propel GT to 224 for six.
In reply, SRH were off to a good start too but could not sustain for long and were stopped at 186 for six. Abhishek Sharma top-scored for SRH with 74 off 41 balls.
This was after Gill blazed away to a 38-ball 76, and Sudharsan chipped in with a breezy 23-ball 48 while forging an opening stand of 87 runs in just 6.5 overs, following which Buttler took GT past 200 with his 64 off 37 deliveries.
Prasidh once again excelled with the ball for GT, finishing with excellent figures of 2/19 in 4 overs. The only cause of concern for GT this evening came when Ishant limped off the ground after failing to complete the final over.
SRH, though, meant business at the start of their innings as Mohammed Siraj (2/33) went for 22 runs in his first two overs, while Ishant Sharma conceded 20 in his first two.
However, a spectacular catch in the deep by Rashid Khan ended Travis Head's innings after he covered a lot of ground to reach the ball, having run from deep square leg and then change his direction to judge it to perfection.
Ishan Kishan got out for 13 after consuming 17 balls, as the required rate went over 14.
Despite the presence of Abhishek and Heinrich in the middle for SRH, the match was already in GT's bag thanks to the asking rate that gone past 16.
Meanwhile, an upset Gill engaged in an animated chat with the two umpires over a review call involving Abhishek, who was seen trying to calm the GT captain.

Over the past two days, Bengaluru has experienced incessant rain, and the trend could continue on the match day as well. According to the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD), ""Rain or thundershowers would occur towards afternoon or evening.""
According to ESPNcricinfo, rain hampered both teams' preparations on the eve of the clash as well. Chennai began its training at 3 pm but could only practice on the field for 45 minutes before the rain intervened. The players then returned to train at 4.30 pm.
Royal Challengers Bengaluru came to practice around 5 pm. Virat Kohli and Devdutt Padikkal batted for around 45 minutes to an hour before rain pelted.
This time, the rain did not ease off for three hours, so RCB's practice session had to be cancelled. Throughout the evening, there was a thunderstorm and occasional lightning, which led to waterlogging in several parts of the city.
Chennai, the five-time champions, have already been knocked out of the race for the playoffs, with just two wins out of ten fixtures, sitting at the bottom of the table.
However, for RCB, the fixture was an invaluable opportunity to move to the top of the table with 16 points. The Royal Challengers occupy the third spot on the points table with seven wins and three defeats.
Bengaluru witnessed a match between RCB and Punjab Kings last month that was reduced to 14 overs a side due to persistent rain.
Chennai will face RCB in Bengaluru for the first time since the nail-biting affair in 2024. In that fixture, RCB's 27-run triumph helped them achieve the unthinkable and scrape their way through the playoffs.
In the ongoing season, RCB registered its first win at Chepauk for the first time since 2008 as they breezed past the Super Kings with a thumping 50-run victory.

India are co-hosts, alongside Sri Lanka, for this year's Asia Cup. While the dates and venues for the event are yet to be confirmed, a report recent claimed that the Asia Cup might not take place this year owing to tensions between India and Pakistan.
Gavaskar was also of the opinion that if the Asia Cup does take place this year, it is highly unlikely for Pakistan to take part in the continental event.
""BCCI's stance has always been what the government of India tells them to do. So I don't think it would be any different when it comes to the Asia Cup. India and Sri Lanka are the hosts for this particular edition of the Asia Cup, so it depends on whether things have changed at all, but if things haven't changed, I can't see Pakistan now being part of the Asia Cup, which is going to be hosted by India and Sri Lanka,"" Gavaskar toldSports Today.
Gavaskar also suggested that the ACC might get dissolved if the situation doesn't improve.
""I don't know how it will be. It might be that the Asian Cricket Council could well be disbanded, and you could just have a three-nation tour, that could well have a three-nation tournament, or a four-nation tournament with maybe Hong Kong or UAE being invited. So that could well happen, the Asian Cricket Council could well be disbanded. But I think it is dependent on what happens in the next couple of months,"" he added.
Gavaskar also pointed out that if India pulls out of the Asia Cup, they might invite other Asian teams for a multi-nation event in India.
""It could well happen that India decides to pull out of the Asian Cricket Council that could well happen. We can say look we're going to have a 4 nation tournament or a 5 nation tournament in Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Afghanistan, and it could be, it could well be that if the tournament is held in Bangladesh, the tournament is held in Sri Lanka, but obviously India is going to be the host, then India will host it in India,"" he added.
""I won't be surprised at all if the Asian Cricket Council gets disbanded with what's been happening.

It also allowed Kohli to fulfil his prophecy from before, as he had warned Khaleel earlier in the season during an altercation from the first time these two sides met.
On March 28, during the first meeting between CSK and RCB in IPL 2025, pacer Khaleel Ahmed had started celebrating Virat Kohli's wicket even though the latter hadn't been given out.
Following that, Kohli had seemingly jokingly warned the pacer that he would dish out the treatment on the field when they meet next.

Khaleel was smashed for four sixes and two boundaries in the over by Shepherd, who ended up slamming the joint-second-fastest half-century in IPL history, thanks to his 14-ball 53.
Shepherd's knock took RCB past the 200-run mark, and ensured they reach a total of 213/5 in 20 overs. The total proved to be enough as CSK narrowly fell short.

In a candid conversation onYouTube, Sania spoke about a lot of topics - ranging from struggles of juggling societal expectations and responsibilities women face in parenting. Sania said that it is never 50-50 when it  comes to the responsibilities of the two parents and even shared some personal anecdotes.
“It is never 50-50 between both parents… I breastfed for 2.5-3 months. For me, that was the hardest part of pregnancy. I am like, I will get pregnant three more times, but this feeding business, I don't know if I can do. For me, it was not the physical aspect of it, but the emotional and mental aspects that were draining. As working women, it ties you down. They are so dependent on it, time commitment, not enough sleep, and you are centering all activities around the feeding schedule. I did what was needful.”
Sania even spoke about the guilt she felt while travelling for the first time since the birth of her son. In a conversation that resonated with working mothers, Sania said that she had to travel to Delhi for an event just six weeks after the birth of her son and shared her feelings during that journey.
“The first time I left Izhaan, he was six weeks old. It was the hardest flight I've taken, I think. I had to go to Delhi for an event, and I said I can't do it. I was being dramatic because, honestly, it isn't. Like people do that all the time, and kids are absolutely fine. We beat ourselves over it because we are giving ourselves mom's guilt,” Sania said in the interview.

In a candid conversation onYouTube, Sania spoke about a lot of topics - ranging from struggles of juggling societal expectations and responsibilities women face in parenting. Sania said that it is never 50-50 when it  comes to the responsibilities of the two parents and even shared some personal anecdotes.
“It is never 50-50 between both parents… I breastfed for 2.5-3 months. For me, that was the hardest part of pregnancy. I am like, I will get pregnant three more times, but this feeding business, I don't know if I can do. For me, it was not the physical aspect of it, but the emotional and mental aspects that were draining. As working women, it ties you down. They are so dependent on it, time commitment, not enough sleep, and you are centering all activities around the feeding schedule. I did what was needful.”
Sania even spoke about the guilt she felt while travelling for the first time since the birth of her son. In a conversation that resonated with working mothers, Sania said that she had to travel to Delhi for an event just six weeks after the birth of her son and shared her feelings during that journey.
“The first time I left Izhaan, he was six weeks old. It was the hardest flight I've taken, I think. I had to go to Delhi for an event, and I said I can't do it. I was being dramatic because, honestly, it isn't. Like people do that all the time, and kids are absolutely fine. We beat ourselves over it because we are giving ourselves mom's guilt,” Sania said in the interview.

https://sports.ndtv.com/ipl-2025/ricky-ponting-reveals-how-shreyas-iyers-tactical-masterclass-left-lsg-stunned-8332580,Ricky Ponting shared insights into Shreyas Iyer's tactical masterclass during Sunday's match between PBKS and LSG.,2025-05-05 10:22:54,"Punjab Kings registered their highest score of the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2025 season, putting 236 on the board against Lucknow Super Giants (LSG). The likes ofPrabhsimran Singh,Shreyas Iyer, and Shashank Singh contributed the most with the bat, adding scores of 91, 45 and 33 respectively but another batter whose cameo helped the team put a resounding total on the board wasJosh Inglis. The Australian hadn't done much with the bat until the match in Dharamsala, where he was promoted to the No. 3 spot. After the game, PBKS head coachRicky Pontingrevealed that the decision to change Inglis' role was taken by skipper Shreyas Iyer.
""It was actually a move that the captain came up with, and Shreyas thought, on that sort of a pitch, against that bowling attack, it would be the right thing to. If a wicket fell early, to send Inglis in. We felt that Mayank would bowl early on, and if you look at the way he bowls, he generally bowls reasonably short, and that's one of Inglis' great strengths. As you saw tonight, those pull shots were pretty amazing straight away,"" Ponting revealed in the press conference.
Inglis scored 30 runs from just 14 balls afterPriyansh Aryadeparted for a 4-ball 1. Inglis scored 4 sixes during his cameo, setting the tone for Punjab's performance with the bat. While LSG were preparing against Priyansh, Prabsimran and Iyer at the top of the batting order, Inglis came out of syllabus.
""So, yeah, that was what the captain wanted to do. It then also allows us to have, you know, Iyer, Wadhera and Shashank through the middle of the innings, which is what we thought would be crucial for us in tonight's game as well. It was probably a surprise call for LSG to see him go out, and it paid off for us tonight.
""Once we got off to a [flier] you know, I think we were 70-odd at the end of the power play, all the momentum was going with us, and you see with our batting, we've got someone like Azmatullah at number nine, so we bat really, really deep, It allows our top order to play with a lot of freedom, and they did that tonight.""
In the press conference, Ponting also revealed that he had backed at least one of Prabhsimran Singh and Priyansh Arya to get a hundred in the match against LSG. Prabhsimran came quite close, scoring 91 from 48 balls in the match.
""Him (Prabhsimran) and Priyansh have got us off to some great starts in the tournament. They both before today, had both made 350 runs each in the tournament. I sort of challenged both of the openers in the team meeting today for one of them to go on and get a hundred in this match, and unfortunately, Prabh fell a little bit short of that.
""With our batting group, we've just given some really clear direction of the way that we want them to play to understand how important top order partnerships are in this competition, and we know that if Priyansh and Prabh get going together, that they can be ultra destructive. Priyansh mainly more against the faster bowlers, and Prabh's as good a hitter against anybody going around, so they complement each other really well, being left hand, right hand, with one probably being slightly better against the quicks, and the other against spinners.
""It's a really good, a really good group. That's why when we sat down as a group, heading in, thinking about our auction strategy and the players that we wanted to retain, I think you're starting to see why I was so keen to retain Prabhsimran. He's a very, very good young player, and he's very keen to bring success to this team, and that showed with the way that he played tonight.""

In fact, many see the 5-match Test series as an opportunity to begin the transition period in the longest format.

Despite a woeful tour of Australia, where rumours of Rohit contemplating retirement were also afloat, the skipper decided against announcing any change. Many feel the Test series against England could be Rohit's last. But, the 38-year-old doesn't seem to have finalised his plans yet.
As per a report in theTimes of India, the BCCI could giveShubman Gillthe vice-captain's role in England, having already made him the deputy in T20Is and ODIs. A senior Indian cricketer, however, has also expressed desire to take up the captaincy role in the short term, but the board, selectors and the coaches are only keen on exploring a long-term solution.
The paper claims that even head coachGautam Gambhirwould want a long-term solution to the problem. Stop-gap options simply don't interest him.
""A new WTC cycle is starting. Future and continuity have to be kept in mind as far as the team is concerned. Even coach Gautam Gambhir would want a set of players he is likely to work with for an extended period. There can't be any stop-gap solutions for such an important series.

With Gill, however, the problem of his inconsistency with the bat also remains. Though he has taken up the No. 3 spot in the Indian Test team, vacated byCheteshwar Pujara, his exploits with the bat have been far from convincing.
Of the 1893 Test runs that Gill has scored in his career, only 649 have come away from home.

Among a number of such emerging stars stands tall Punjab Kings' opening batterPrabhsimran Singh, who narrowly missed out on a century against Lucknow Super Giants on Sunday. As Prabsimran called his ailing father after his 48-ball 91, the message he received was that the batter threw his wicket away after getting so close to a century.
Prabhsimran's father, Sardar Surjit Singh, isn't going through the best of times, needing to get dialysis done three times a week. In such complicated times, Prabhsimran's performances for PBKS on the pitch have somehow managed to bring a smile back on Surjit Singh's face.
""The only time he smiles these days is when he sees Prabhsimran bat in the IPL,"" Surjit Singh's brother Satwinderpal Singh told theTimes of India.
""He is going through dialysis thrice a week. As an elder brother, I can't see the pain he is enduring. I have to step out of the house when the doctors come home for the dialysis. Not a day has gone by that I have not prayed that it should not be my younger brother,"" said Satwinderpal Singh, who has worked as a mentor for Prabhsimran along with his own sonsAnmolpreet SinghandTejpreet Singh.

While Prabhsimran is ruling the roost all across the country with his bat, his father and uncle enjoy his performances by sitting in front of the television in Patiala. In fact, when Surjit sees his son Prabhsimran hit a rash shot, he shouts in front of the TV, saying he should play cautiously.
""Before every Punjab Kings match, I carry him to the living room. We watch the match together, and every time the camera is on Simmu, he smiles. If Simmu scores, he keeps on smiling and laughing. In those moments, he forgets the pain he is in. If Simmu plays a rash shot, he shouts, 'khotte aaram naal khel (play sensibly).'""
When Prabsimran called his father after the 91-run knock against Lucknow, he was scolded by Surjit for not completing the ton.
""Simmu video called on Monday morning to take an update about Surjit. And my brother gave him back by saying why he threw away his wicket after getting so close to the hundred,"" said Satwinderpal with a laugh.
""While shouting at Simmu, he gasps for breath. Every time I have to intervene and tell him to praise the kid, because he is playing so well.""

After the trio ofMitchell Marsh,Aiden Markram, andNicholas Pooranfell early, the onus was on Pant,Ayush Badoni, and other middle-order batters to resurrect the team's position in the chase of 237 runs against Punjab. But, LSG could only reach 199/7, despite Badoni's 40-ball 74. Once again this season, Lucknow were let down by their captain, Pant, when they needed him the most, and owner Sanjiv Goenka's reaction summed up the feeling in the dugout.

A fighting half-century by Ayush Badoni and his 81-run stand with Abdul Samad was the only highlight as LSG suffered a 37-run loss to PBKS after a top-order failure at the HPCA stadium in Dharmasala. Had skipper Pant shown more patience in the middle, things could've ended differently for the Super Giants.
Sanjiv Goenka, who has developed a reputation as a hard taskmaster after multiple on-field confrontations with his captains, was understandably not pleased to see Pant depart early. The wicket-keeper batter was bought by Goenka for a record fee of INR 27 crore in the mega auction last year. So far, it's fair to say, the money's worth hasn't been received.

After the game, Pant blamed the team's poor fielding as the reason behind the defeat.
""Definitely too many runs. When you're gonna drop crucial catches at the wrong time, it is going to hurt you badly. We thought it was going to do more. We didn't pick the length right at the start. That's part and parcel of the game. The dream is still alive. If we're gonna win the next three matches, we definitely can turn it around.
""It makes sense when your top order is batting really well. In every match, you can't hope they will come off nicely. It's part of the game. We need to take the game deep. Every time, they can't do the heavy job for us. Like you said in the first, we had too many to chase. That hurt us badly,"" Rishabh Pant said in the post-match presentation ceremony.

Among a number of such emerging stars stands tall Punjab Kings' opening batterPrabhsimran Singh, who narrowly missed out on a century against Lucknow Super Giants on Sunday. As Prabsimran called his ailing father after his 48-ball 91, the message he received was that the batter threw his wicket away after getting so close to a century.
Prabhsimran's father, Sardar Surjit Singh, isn't going through the best of times, needing to get dialysis done three times a week. In such complicated times, Prabhsimran's performances for PBKS on the pitch have somehow managed to bring a smile back on Surjit Singh's face.
""The only time he smiles these days is when he sees Prabhsimran bat in the IPL,"" Surjit Singh's brother Satwinderpal Singh told theTimes of India.
""He is going through dialysis thrice a week. As an elder brother, I can't see the pain he is enduring. I have to step out of the house when the doctors come home for the dialysis. Not a day has gone by that I have not prayed that it should not be my younger brother,"" said Satwinderpal Singh, who has worked as a mentor for Prabhsimran along with his own sonsAnmolpreet SinghandTejpreet Singh.

While Prabhsimran is ruling the roost all across the country with his bat, his father and uncle enjoy his performances by sitting in front of the television in Patiala. In fact, when Surjit sees his son Prabhsimran hit a rash shot, he shouts in front of the TV, saying he should play cautiously.
""Before every Punjab Kings match, I carry him to the living room. We watch the match together, and every time the camera is on Simmu, he smiles. If Simmu scores, he keeps on smiling and laughing. In those moments, he forgets the pain he is in. If Simmu plays a rash shot, he shouts, 'khotte aaram naal khel (play sensibly).'""
When Prabsimran called his father after the 91-run knock against Lucknow, he was scolded by Surjit for not completing the ton.
""Simmu video called on Monday morning to take an update about Surjit. And my brother gave him back by saying why he threw away his wicket after getting so close to the hundred,"" said Satwinderpal with a laugh.
""While shouting at Simmu, he gasps for breath. Every time I have to intervene and tell him to praise the kid, because he is playing so well.""

After the trio ofMitchell Marsh,Aiden Markram, andNicholas Pooranfell early, the onus was on Pant,Ayush Badoni, and other middle-order batters to resurrect the team's position in the chase of 237 runs against Punjab. But, LSG could only reach 199/7, despite Badoni's 40-ball 74. Once again this season, Lucknow were let down by their captain, Pant, when they needed him the most, and owner Sanjiv Goenka's reaction summed up the feeling in the dugout.

A fighting half-century by Ayush Badoni and his 81-run stand with Abdul Samad was the only highlight as LSG suffered a 37-run loss to PBKS after a top-order failure at the HPCA stadium in Dharmasala. Had skipper Pant shown more patience in the middle, things could've ended differently for the Super Giants.
Sanjiv Goenka, who has developed a reputation as a hard taskmaster after multiple on-field confrontations with his captains, was understandably not pleased to see Pant depart early. The wicket-keeper batter was bought by Goenka for a record fee of INR 27 crore in the mega auction last year. So far, it's fair to say, the money's worth hasn't been received.

After the game, Pant blamed the team's poor fielding as the reason behind the defeat.
""Definitely too many runs. When you're gonna drop crucial catches at the wrong time, it is going to hurt you badly. We thought it was going to do more. We didn't pick the length right at the start. That's part and parcel of the game. The dream is still alive. If we're gonna win the next three matches, we definitely can turn it around.
""It makes sense when your top order is batting really well. In every match, you can't hope they will come off nicely. It's part of the game. We need to take the game deep. Every time, they can't do the heavy job for us. Like you said in the first, we had too many to chase. That hurt us badly,"" Rishabh Pant said in the post-match presentation ceremony.

Despite a woeful tour of Australia, where rumours of Rohit contemplating retirement were also afloat, the skipper decided against announcing any change. Many feel the Test series against England could be Rohit's last. But, the 38-year-old doesn't seem to have finalised his plans yet.
As per a report in theTimes of India, the BCCI could giveShubman Gillthe vice-captain's role in England, having already made him the deputy in T20Is and ODIs. A senior Indian cricketer, however, has also expressed desire to take up the captaincy role in the short term, but the board, selectors and the coaches are only keen on exploring a long-term solution.
The paper claims that even head coachGautam Gambhirwould want a long-term solution to the problem. Stop-gap options simply don't interest him.
""A new WTC cycle is starting. Future and continuity have to be kept in mind as far as the team is concerned. Even coach Gautam Gambhir would want a set of players he is likely to work with for an extended period. There can't be any stop-gap solutions for such an important series. The last two Test series haven't been ideal for the team and the England series is very crucial,"" the paper quoted a source as saying.

Vaibhav, aged 14, promises of a big future, thanks to his undeniable talent. While the whole of India is proud of the skills he possess, his birth-state, Bihar, is understandably going ga-ga. In fact, even Prime Minister Narendra Modi praised Vaibhav for the way he has begun his IPL career.
""I have seen in the IPL, the son of Bihar,Vaibhav Suryavanshi's spectacular performance. At such a young age, Vaibhav has set such a great record. There is a lot of hard work behind Vaibhav's performance,"" PM Modi said in his address during the inauguration of the Khelo India Youth Games in Bihar.
Vaibhav, who hails from Samastipur in Bihar, famously hit a 35-ball hundred against the Gujarat Titans, breaking several records in the process. For PM Modi, there needs to be constant push on sports in the country to unearth more talents Vaibhav.
""To bring his talent to the forefront, he has played many matches at different levels. The more you play, the more you will shine. Competing in matches and competitions as much as possible is very important. The NDA government has always given it the highest priority in its policies.
""The government's focus is on giving our athletes the opportunity to play new sports. That is why the Khelo India Youth Games included Gatka, Kho-kho, Malkhambh and Yogasana. In recent days, our athletes have performed very well in many new sports like Wushu, Lawn Balls, and Roller Skating,"" PM Modi added.
""There is a new national education policy, in which we have made sports a part of mainstream education. The aim of this policy is to create excellent sports professionals along with good players in the country.
""My young friends, we know that sportsmanship plays a very important role in every aspect of life. We learn team spirit in the field of sports. We learn to move forward together,"" he said.

Jayawardene said Rohit was also carrying a niggle from India's victorious campaign in Champions Trophy. ""No, it wasn't at the start. Obviously, Ro (Rohit) was on the field in some of the games,"" Jayawardene said during MI's training session when asked if it was the plan since the beginning to the season.
""But if you look at the composition of the team, most of the guys are doing dual roles; most of them are bowling. At the same time, some of the venues need boundary runners, you need guys with speed and all that so that also comes into play.
""Ro was also nursing a niggle from the Champions Trophy so we wanted to make sure that we don't push him too hard, and we have managed that while (his) batting is the most important thing,"" he added.
Jayawardene said Rohit has otherwise contributed “tremendously” both on and off the field.
""If you've seen, he's always been around in the dugout, or he goes in during timeouts, and there's a lot of communication that's been happening, so actively involved."" Jayawardene acknowledged MI has been benefitted from Rohit andRyan Rickeltonfinding success as an opening pair.
""For any team, the openers do play a very valuable part in establishing the innings and especially with the batting lineup that we have, the way we build when we get a good start, it always complements to that,"" he said.
""It's just that even though Ro, probably (in) the last few years, he hadn't (had) those big scores but he was trying to give us that impetus as well -- even though I was in the head coach, I was watching -- he used to get those quick 20s or 30s but couldn't convert."" Jayawardene saidJasprit Bumrah's bowling pace has shown an upward spike.
""He made a good recovery and it didn't take long for him to get into the stride as well. That's a good thing about Jasprit that he's got a lot of control, confidence in how he wants to go about and he gives us a completely different dimension to this attack,"" he said.
""He's fine, there's nothing wrong with him. We've monitored him, his pace is getting better and better, so execution is better, we saw that in the last game as well, he was quite aggressive and how he wanted to go about it,"" Jayawardene added.
The former Sri Lankan skipper said playing two of their last three matches at home will help Mumbai Indians as they push for a final-four finish, but refused to see Tuesday's game as a prelude to a knockout clash.
""When I saw the schedule, I knew that having to play your last two games out of the three at home obviously was a good thing. We were starting away from home, so we knew that might come into play, and it has come to play.
""I haven't thought about the playoffs. There are five (or) six teams with KKR winning yesterday (Sunday) as well, so there's different permutations, and I'm not going to even go through that, how everything's going to unfold,"" he said.",2025-05-05 23:52:10,cricket,Positive

Talking about the match, Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) won the toss and elected to bowl first against Delhi Capitals (DC) in match 55 of the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2025 at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium. All-rounder T. Natarajan will be making his debut for Delhi Capitals asMohammad ShamiandNitish KumarReddy are dropped from the SRH playing XI.
Sunrisers Hyderabad captain Pat Cummins said, ""We'll bowl. We've talked about a few things, but haven't had a complete game yet. Want to do the basics well. It's about giving yourself the chance, everyone's a match-winner. We bat very deep.
""The support has been amazing, probably haven't had the results we wanted, but the crowd has been amazing. Buzzing around in the field, that's one thing we can judge ourselves on,"" he said.
Delhi Capitals captain Axar Patel said, ""Would've fielded first as well, looks like a good wicket and it shouldn't change much. Will look to get a good score and restrict them. The last phase is here, and these are must-win games. We've tried to keep the environment light, we weren't thinking about these things at the start of the tournament, and we played well, wanted to go into these games with the same mindset and not let the situation pressure us.
""We've had different players contribute, we haven't been dependent on one player. We want to have close games, even if we lose, we don't want to lose by big margins. No changes,"" he added.

Urvil, 26, represents Gujarat in domestic cricket. He gained nationwide attention during the 2024-25 Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy when he smashed the joint-fastest T20 century by an Indian batter — a blistering 28-ball ton against Tripura. That innings helped him cement his place as one of the most exciting uncapped talents in the country.
Urvil had a memorable campaign in that edition of the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy. He scored 315 runs in 6 matches, including two centuries, at an average of over 78 and a strike rate nearing 230. His attacking approach at the top of the order and wicketkeeping skills make him a valuable addition to any T20 side.
Overall, Urvil Patel has played 47 T20s, scoring 1162 runs with two hundreds and four fifties. He was also part of the Gujarat Titans squad in IPL 2023, although he did not get a chance to play.
He joins CSK for his base price of Rs 30 lakh and becomes the third player this season to join the team as an injury replacement. Earlier, CSK brought in 17-year-old Mumbai opener Ayush Mhatre as a replacement for injured captain Ruturaj Gaikwad, who could play only five games this season. Later, South Africa's Dewald Brevis was added to the squad as a replacement for pacer Gurjapneet Singh.
Chennai Super Kings have had a difficult season, both on and off the field. With just two wins from 11 games, they are at the bottom of the IPL 2025 points table and have already been knocked out of the playoffs race. With three matches still to play, the team will look to test its bench strength and possibly give Urvil Patel his maiden IPL cap before the season ends.",2025-05-06 01:43:24,cricket,Positive

The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) is reportedly displeased with the coach's recent press conference remarks, compounding the scrutiny already mounting over his controversial team methods. According to a report, though Gambhir has the board's backing at present, things could change quickly if India's T20 World Cup 2026 performances at home are affected
Following the crushing defeat, Gambhir's post-match press conference has become a focal point of contention. While publicly accepting collective responsibility, the coach's defiant stance and his perceived attempt to shift blame or offer contradictions have not gone down well with the BCCI hierarchy.
According to a report in theHindustan Times, Gambhir's forthright comments, particularly on the pitch conditions after the Kolkata Test, were seen as adding unnecessary fuel to the fire. The report suggests the Board is unhappy with the tone and content of his public statements, adding a layer of off-field drama to the team's on-field slump.
As the public sentiment increasingly turns against Gambhir, the head coach doesn't have a lot of time before the board turns its back on him, too.
India's Test record, especially at home, has been the primary concern for the top bosses. Under Gambhir's leadership, the team has suffered multiple home series defeats, an unthinkable scenario for Indian cricket under Gambhir's predecessors likeRahul DravidandRavi Shastri.
A major point of criticism from former players and experts is Gambhir's over-reliance on all-rounders/part-timers at the expense of specialist batters and bowlers. This tactical approach is believed to have sacrificed stability and depth, undermining the foundation required for success in the five-day format.
The pressure from dismal performances in the red-ball format is rising on Gambhir, and it won't be long before he loses the backing he currently has. India are not scheduled to play a home Test series until August 2026, hence, the BCCI is not keen to dismiss the coach from the Test format just yet.
Gambhir's success as the team's white-ball coach does play a role in the confidence the BCCI has in him. But the coach needs to keep the pendulum swinging in the T20 World Cup, too.",2025-11-28 20:32:50,cricket,Positive

India's sweeping 0-2 home series defeat against South Africa has opened Pandora's box, with questions being raised over the selection committee and team management's decision to force veterans likeRohit Sharma,Virat Kohli, andRavichandran Ashwinout of the team. Ashwin himself feels the trio could've stayed for a longer time and helped the team with a smooth transition. But India's batting legendSunil Gavaskarisn't entirely on board with the theory.
Ashwin, in a video on his YouTube channel, hinted that the case with him, Kohli, and Rohit was that they lacked clarity over their future. The clouds of uncertainty, hence, pushed them towards taking the harsh decision and retiring from the longest format. Ashwin, for the matter of fact, retired mid-series on the Border-Gavaskar Trophy tour of Australia.
""There must be a certain pathway for transition. When there is no clarity, it becomes an individualistic decision. Virat could have groomed players. Rohit could have done that. I could have done that. I have always spoken about the importance of knowledge transfer. It has never been our strength,"" Ashwin said in a video on hisYouTubechannel.
Adding to Ashwin's sentiments, many fans feel that the results in the home Test series against South Africa could've been different if the likes of Rohit and Kohli were still with the team. But, Gavaskar doesn't think so.
Gavaskar, an iconic batter in Indian cricket, feels Kohli, Rohit, and Ashwin's decision to retire was their own; the blame can't be put on the management. Gavaskar also referred to India's 0-3 series defeat against Australia when all three of them were part of the team, saying their presence couldn't rescue India then. Hence, there's no certainty that they would've done so against South Africa at home.
""No, the call to take retirements must have been their call. Probably, they might have been asked to consider their future. But we can't say that had they been here, we would have won. They were there when we lost to New Zealand. What happened when they were there? We lost 0-3, no? Then what happened in Australia? We should not be thinking on these lines. No, we can't be thinking about whether we pushed them to retirement. That is the wrong way to approach this,"" Gavaskar said onAajtak.
While Ashwin has quit all three formats, talks of Rohit and Kohli being moved on from ODI cricket have been buzzing for a while now. However, the results against South Africa in the Test series could see those suggestions calming down.",2025-11-28 20:32:51,cricket,Positive

But, little did the fans of cricket's richest league know that spending a 'record-breaking' fee of Rs 27 crore would become one of the biggest reasons behind Lucknow Super Giants' early elimination from the T20 league. Pant shattered all records as the Sanjiv Goenka-led franchise splashed an eye-watering sum to avail the wicket-keeper batter's services. Cometh the 18th edition of the IPL, the management even decided to hand over the captaincy responsibilities to Pant.
In the 12 matches that LSG have played so far this season, Pant has had the opportunity to bat in 11. Barring a solitary half-century in the match against the Chennai Super Kings, which too came in a losing cause, Pant couldn't even cross the 25-run mark in the other 10 games.
Pant made quite a few bizarre decisions over the course of 11 outings for LSG this season, one of which saw him even come out to bat at the No. 7 spot. The result was a Golden Duck, which was followed by an incessant flow of trolling on social media.
In the match against the Sunrisers, Pant made the bold call of demotingNicholas Pooran, arguably the team's most fearsome hitter, by one spot to play himself at the No. 3 position. Even this stunt didn't produce the results the skipper wanted, as he was dismissed without even getting into a double-digit score.
Some dressing room scenes even hinted at a conflict between the team's support staff and the skipper over certain on-field decisions. Confusion and a lack of clarity over the affairs of the team could be clearly seen.
Rishabh Pant's IPL 2025 Stats (after 12 matches):
Rishabh Pant In IPL 2025 (Match-By-Match):
Tom Moody, an IPL-winner with the Sunrisers Hyderabad, feels the fact that LSG spent a combined sum of Rs 48 crore on the duo of Rishabh Pant and Nicholas Pooran played a significant role in the team's inability to build a strong bowling attack. The balance of the team, skewed in the process, was hit significantly.
""The expense on Rishabh Pant and Nicholas Pooran, those two players, makes it very hard to build a very strong bowling unit. Because you just don't have the funds to compete at the auction table,"" Moody said in a panel discussion on ESPNCricinfo.
""In an ideal world, it's great to have Pooran, (David) Miller, (Mitchell) Marsh, Pant... all these are impactful batters, but at the end of the day, you need to bowl. You've got to be able to have an impactful bowling unit in powerplays. Be adaptable in the middle overs and take wickets, and squeeze the opposition. And in the back-end of the innings, you need people to close the game under pressure - take wickets, bowl those really challenging overs when the opposition is going hell-for-leather against you. And I just don't think they've got any of that.""
The core responsibilities of a management are to build a balanced squad that is capable of performing as a unit, not just individually. As the LSG management put its head into auction preparations, the balance was fundamentally ignored.
Having already spent Rs 21 crore for Pooran, Lucknow shouldn't have gone as far as Rs 27 crore for Pant. But, the bosses gave in to the lure of signing arguably the most coveted Indian player in the market.
Though money spent doesn't directly transform into performances, a player of Pant's calibre was expected to deliver a lot more than he has. The manner in which the 2025 season has ended for LSG doesn't raise question marks over the franchise's plans for the next year, especially the fact that the bosses have Pant in their plans or not.",2025-11-28 20:32:56,cricket,Positive

The spacecraft was part of the Venera programme to gather information about Venus, but a malfunctioning timer prevented it from completing its mission.
According to satellite tracker Marco Langbroek, the spacecraft is now predicted to re-enter Earth's atmosphere around May 10, give or take a few days.

The spacecraft's fate is uncertain, with experts debating whether it will burn up or survive re-entry. If it survives, it could land between 51.7 degrees north and south latitude, potentially impacting populated areas or oceans.
Orbital updates have resumed (yay!), see my latest forecast here:https://t.co/q006UTzlFhCurrent forecast from our reentry model: 10 May 14:30 UTC +- 2.2 days. Latest model runs are slowly creeping to a slightly later reentry time.pic.twitter.com/jYBNv6ctsg
Kosmos 482 is approximately 480 kilograms and one metre in diameter. Experts are skeptical that the parachute system would still function after all these years, and the heat shield could be damaged. Without the heat shield, the spacecraft would burn up, but if it does persist, a half-tonne metal object will suddenly drop from the sky.
The landing site for the spacecraft is unknown, and there are chance that it will land in the ocean. The event also draws attention to the increasing concern regarding space debris and uncontrolled re-entry risks.

When launched, the Soviet probe was bound for Venus, but a technical failure locked it in a perpetual orbit around Earth. However, it is expected to start falling back to the Earth in an uncontrolled re-entry around May 10.

Since the probe was designed to withstand acceleration, high pressures, and extreme heat on Venus, there is a small chance it might survive the reentry when most space objects disintegrate upon entering the Earth's atmosphere.
""As this is a lander that was designed to survive passage through the Venus atmosphere, it is possible it will survive reentry through the Earth atmosphere intact, and impact intact,"" said Mr Langbroek.
""There are many uncertain factors in this though, including that this will be a long shallow reentry trajectory and the age of the object.""
As for where the object will crash on Earth, it is still far too early to tell. However, with an orbital inclination of 51.7 degrees, the reentry can occur anywhere between latitudes 52 degrees north and 52 degrees south. While it is likely that the probe will crash into a water body, there is a small chance it might thud into land.

https://www.ndtv.com/science/is-gravity-the-code-new-theory-suggests-the-universe-is-a-giant-quantum-computer-8288118,Is Gravity The Code? New Theory Suggests The Universe Is A Giant Quantum Computer,"Tue, 29 Apr 2025 20:04:05 +0530","A groundbreaking study proposes that gravity might be a product of computational processes within the universe, hinting that the cosmos could be operating like a giant quantum computer. Physicist Melvin Vopson from the University of Portsmouth suggests that gravity could be a by-product of the universe's attempt to organize information and matter in space and time.
Thisnew theoryraises intriguing questions about the nature of reality and whether we are living in a simulated environment. If proven true, it could revolutionize our understanding of the universe and its underlying mechanisms.
Dr Melvin Vopsonsuggeststhat gravity might actually be caused by how information about matter is organised in the universe. Using the second law of information dynamics, he indicates that matter and objects in space may be being pulled together because the universe is trying to keep information tidy and compressed.
Dr Vopson said: ""My findings in this study fit with the thought that the universe might work like a giant computer, or our reality is a simulated construct. Just like computers try to save space and run more efficiently, the universe might be doing the same. It's a new way to think about gravity - not just as a pull, but as something that happens when the universe is trying to stay organised.""
Dr Vopson has previously published research suggesting that information has mass and that all elementary particles - the smallest known building blocks of the universe - store information about themselves, similar to the way cells, the building blocks of biological entities, have DNA.
In this latest research, Dr Vopson shows how space pixelation in elementary cells can act as a data storage medium, and demonstrates how the role of information stored in elementary cells is to provide the properties and the coordinates of matter in the space-time simulated construct. Each cell can register information in the form of binary data so if it is empty it registers a digital ""0"", and if matter is present in a cell it registers a digital ""1"".
Dr Vopson added: ""The process is identical to how a digital computer game, virtual reality application, or other advanced simulation would be designed.""
He explains that as a cell can accommodate more than one particle, then the system will evolve itself by moving the particles in space to join them together into a single larger particle inside a single cell.
""This triggers the attracting force because of the rule set in the computational system, requiring the minimisation of the information content, and by extension, a reduction of the computational power. Put simply, it is far more computationally effective to track and compute the location and momentum of a single object in space, than numerous objects. Therefore, it appears that the gravitational attraction is just another optimising mechanism in a computational process that has the role to compress information.""

https://www.ndtv.com/science/switzerland-trials-railway-tracks-with-solar-panels-to-power-trains-8287302,Switzerland Trials Railway Tracks With Solar Panels To Power Trains,"Tue, 29 Apr 2025 18:28:12 +0530","A solar technology startup in Switzerland is hoping to exploit the open space between railway tracks to produce sustainable energy by placing solar panels. Under a Rs 6.04 crore (585,000 Swiss francs) pilot project, as many as 48 solar panels have been placed on a 100-metre portion of railway tracks in Buttes, a small village in western Switzerland.
The technology has been developed by Sun-Ways after its founder, Joseph Scuderi, first had the idea in 2020 while waiting for a train. After receiving a green light from the Federal Office of Transport (FOT), the startup deployed the solar panels on the railway line, currently being operated by transN.
""We installed solar panels as we would on the roof of a house,"" Mr Scuderi toldSwissinfo, adding that getting this far ""has been a miracle"".
Notably, the project was initially rejected by FOT in 2023 over concerns that the solar panels could affect the safety of the trains and related maintenance efforts. However, Sun-Ways consulted experts to conduct an independent study on the proposal to prove that the specialised solar panels would not interfere with the active railway.
While solar panels are usually permanently fixed, Sun-Ways has developed a proprietary technology where the panels can be removed whenever required so that the track maintenance team can perform its job. Swiss track maintenance company Scheuchzer can place and remove nearly 1,000 square metres of solar panels in just a few hours.

As per the company, the photovoltaic current produced by the solar panels could be used in three ways. In the first scenario, the energy could be ""reinjected"" to power the railway infrastructure (switches, signals, stations) while in second instance, the current can be fed into the electricity network of the nearest local GRD (Distribution Network Operator).
However, Sun-Ways claims that reinjecting the current into the traction energy network that powers the locomotives is the best way to extract the full benefits of the pilot programme. Sun-Ways says the approximately 5,320 kilometres of the Swiss rail network could generate one billion kWh of solar power per year, which is enough to fulfil the consumption demand of 300,000 households.
""It is good that rail and public transport companies are innovating, including in renewable energy production,"" said Florence Pictet, spokesperson for the FOT.
Sun-Ways says it has already received interest from countries such as China and the US while collaborating on similar projects in South Korea, Spain and Romania.

UK Scientist Makes Bold Claim,"Tue, 29 Apr 2025 11:30:34 +0530","Are we living in a simulated reality like in the movie'The Matrix'?Dr. Melvin Vopson, a UK-based physicist, suggests that gravity might be evidence we're living in a virtual world, with the universe acting like a giant computer. His theory echoes the 1999 film's concept of a simulated universe, but with a scientific twist.Dr. Vopson's researchsuggests that gravity might be a form of data organisation, similar to computer code compression. He proposes that the universe's tendency to pull objects with mass towards the Earth's core is analogous to how computers optimise data, supporting the idea that our universe could be a simulated or computational construct.
""The universe evolves in a way that the information content in it is compressed, optimised and organised – just as computers and computer code do. Hence, gravity appears to be another process of data compression in a possibly simulated universe,"" he told theDaily Mail.
According to the study, gravity reduces ""information entropy,"" or the amount of information an object holds in a given space. Gravity shapes galaxies, orbits planets around stars, and affects nearby objects' motion. In Dr Vopson's theory, gravity pulls objects together as the universe strives to keep information organised and compressed.
""To put it simply, it is easier to compute all the properties and characteristics of a single object in space, rather than multiple objects. That is why objects in space are pulled together,"" Dr Vopson added.
Dr. Vopson's idea builds on hisprevious workon entropy in information theory, which likely explores how information systems tend to become more disordered or complex over time.
""A super complex universe like ours, if it were a simulation, would require a built-in data optimisation and compression to reduce the computational power and the data storage requirements to run the simulation. This is exactly what we are observing all around us, including in digital data, biological systems, mathematical symmetries and the entire universe,"" heexplained in 2023.
This time, he shifted his focus from biological systems to gravity, exploring its potential connection to information theory and the simulated universe hypothesis.
""My findings in this study fit with the thought that the universe might work like a giant computer, or our reality is a simulated construct. Just like computers try to save space and run more efficiently, the universe might be doing the same.

https://www.ndtv.com/science/nasa-satellite-captures-solar-eclipse-visible-only-from-space-8283055,NASA Satellite Captures Solar Eclipse Visible Only From Space,"Tue, 29 Apr 2025 09:28:19 +0530","A solar eclipse visible only from space was captured in various images thanks to the US space agency NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). According to Forbes, the event took place on Sunday, April 27. The moon blocked 23% of the sun in a partial eclipse, but it was not possible to see this from Earth. The images of the ""lunar transit"" show in its entirety, before a large dark orb - moon - passes by, blocking almost a quarter of the star from view.
NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)is a semi-autonomous spacecraft that points at the sun, allowing almost continuous observation. The satellite was launched in February 2010. Since then, it has observed multiple lunar transits, or eclipses, many of which are not visible from Earth.
According to NASA, there will be another eclipse on May 25 that will cover only four per cent of the sun. Another eclipse is due on July 25, which is expected to cover 62% of the sun.
This is not the first time an eclipse has been seen by SDO or by astronauts in space. According to Forbes, several Apollo astronauts witnessed an eclipse of the sun as they travelled to the moon.

Notably, the last solar eclipse visible from Earth was in March this year, which caused the moon to turn a deep red colour. The phenomenon is known as a Blood Moon, as the same atmospheric effect that causes sunsets to appear red affects the moon.
""A lunar eclipse occurs when the Sun, Earth, and Moon align so that the Moon passes into Earth's shadow. In a total lunar eclipse, the entire Moon falls within the darkest part of Earth's shadow, called the umbra,"" NASA said at the time.
The next solar eclipse visible from Earth will be on September 21. It will be visible from New Zealand, the South Pacific and Antarctica.
A total solar eclipse will take place on August 12, 2026. It will be visible from within a narrow path of totality that passes through eastern Greenland, western Iceland and northern Spain, with totality lasting just over two minutes. The total eclipse is the best kind, during which the moon momentarily blocks out all of the sun, allowing its corona to be seen with the naked eye.

""People haven't got it yet, people haven't understood what's coming,"" warned Mr Hinton in aCBSinterview.
""I'm in the unfortunate position of happening to agree with Elon Musk on this, which is that there's a 10 to 20 per cent chance that these things will take over, but that's just a wild guess,"" he added.
Mr Hinton was referring to the Tesla CEO, who has claimed that AI will become smarter than the entire human race by 2029. Mr Musk is also the chief executive of xAI, the company that developed the AI chatbot Grok.
According to Mr Hinton, AI companies should dedicate a ""third of their computing power"" or significantly more resources to safety research.
""If you look at what the big companies are doing right now, they're lobbying to get less AI regulation. There's hardly any regulation as it is, but they want less,"" Mr Hinton said.

Mr Hinton laid the foundations for machine learning that is powering today's AI-based products and applications. However, the Nobel laureate grew wary of AI's future development and cut ties with his employer, Google, in order to speak more freely on the issue.
""It will be comparable with the industrial revolution. But instead of exceeding people in physical strength, it's going to exceed people in intellectual ability. We have no experience of what it's like to have things smarter than us,"" said Mr Hinton at the time.
""I am worried that the overall consequence of this might be systems more intelligent than us that eventually take control.""
Mr Hinton has been a big advocate of government regulation for the technology, especially given the exceptional pace of development.
Apart from Mr Hinton, Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis has also warned about the perils of AI. In a recent interview, Mr Hassabis said society is not ready for human-level AI, popularly referred to as Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).
The 2024 Nobel Prize in Chemistry winner said AI systems capable of human-level cognitive abilities were only five to ten years away and that such development was keeping him up at night.

According to food researchers at the Technical University of Munich, a mushroom calledAmaropostia stiptica, better known as bitter bracket fungus, is officially the 'most bitter thing in the world', as per a report in theBBC.
The mushroom is widely available in Britain, and despite being extremely bitter, it is not toxic. The researchers extracted three compounds from the mushroom and studied their effect on human taste receptors.
This tree-growing mushroom has a compound that is so potent that an individual would be able to taste a single gram of the substance dissolved in 106 bathtubs of water. Named oligoporin D, this chemical activates specialised bitter receptors in our mouths which also help detect natural poisons.

The study results, published in theJournal of Agricultural and Food Chemistrymay help scientists research how humans evolved to be able to detect bitter tastes and why. Notably, bitter is one of the five basic taste sensations humans have, alongside sweet, sour, salty and savoury, also called ""umami"".
""Our results contribute to expanding our knowledge of the molecular diversity and mode of action of natural bitter compounds,"" said lead researcher Dr Maik Behrens.
""In the long term, insights in this area could enable new applications in food and health research, for example in the development of sensorially appealing foods that positively influence digestion and satiety.""
Prior to the German study, most of the research had centred around how flowering plants can have a bitter taste. However, fewer studies had been done looking at fungi such as mushrooms.
Studies show that sensors for bitter substances are also found in the stomach, intestines, heart and lungs apart from the mouth.
Previous studies have indicated that sensors for bitter substances are not only found in the mouth but also in the stomach, intestines, heart and lungs. Researchers stated that closely analysing compounds derived from fungi like oligoporin D could be key to understanding our complex relationship with bitterness.

Using the Korea Microlensing Telescope Network (KMTNet), an international team of researchers has discovered that super-Earth exoplanets are more common across the universe than previously thought, according to a new study.
By studying light anomalies made by the newly found planet's host star and combining their results with a larger sample from a KMTNet microlensing survey, the team found that super-Earths can exist as far from their host star as our gas giants are from the sun, said Andrew Gould, co-author of the study and professor emeritus of astronomy at The Ohio State University.
""Scientists knew there were more small planets than big planets, but in this study, we were able to show that within this overall pattern, there are excesses and deficits,"" he said. ""It's very interesting.""
While it can be relatively easy to locate worlds that orbit close to their star, planets with wider paths can be difficult to detect.
Still, researchers further estimated that for every three stars, there should be at least one super-Earth present with a Jupiter-like orbital period, suggesting these massive worlds are extremely prevalent across the universe, said Gould, whose early theoretical research helped develop the field of planetary microlensing.
The findings in this study were made via microlensing, an observational effect that occurs when the presence of mass warps the fabric of space-time to a detectable degree.
When a foreground object, such as a star or planet, passes between an observer and a more distant star, light is curved from the source, causing an apparent increase in the object's brightness that can last anywhere from a few hours to several months.

As per a new study published on the preprint serverarXiv, the Great Wall, which is located 10 billion light-years from Earth, could be as large as 15 billion light-years in size, up from the previous estimate of 10 billion light-years long.
Using a recently developed methodology, scientists re-examined the Great Wall, which was first discovered, more than a decade ago.
""Evidence is provided that the Hercules-Corona Borealis Great Wall cluster is larger than previously thought. The extension of this cluster's size does not appear to have been due to statistical variations or sampling biases,"" the study highlighted.
By analysing the gamma-ray bursts that are produced during extreme cosmic events such as the collapse of a supernova, the birth of a black hole, or the collision of two neutron stars, scientists managed to figure out the new length of the Great Wall.
The team examined 542 gamma-ray bursts with known redshifts, which showed that the Great Wall may extend from a redshift of 0.33 to a redshift of 2.43 -- a total distance of around 15 billion light-years
""We also found evidence that the Hercules-Corona Borealis Great Wall is larger than previously identified and that it appears to encompass several smaller clusters,"" it added.

In February this year, scientists claimed to have discovered another large superstructure called Quipu, believed to measure 1.3 billion light-years across, which is over 13,000 times the length of the Milky Way.
As per the study, Quipu is responsible for a ""large part of the gravitational pull that causes the peculiar motion of the Local Group with respect to the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) frame"". However, more information is needed to identify the effects of such a structure on its neighbourhood.
The scientists added that while the superstructure was massive in size currently, it would soon collapse and form independent units.
Studying an object as massive as the Great Wall or Quipu could help scientists broaden their understanding of how galaxies evolve and improve the existing cosmological models.

The Houston-based company has been contracted by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and NASA to fly Group Captain Shukla to the space station next month.
Mr Bhatia, whose parents immigrated from India to New York in 1970, is a former Google executive and a Columbia University graduate.
""The opportunity to work with India on the Axiom-4 mission and its future space ambitions is a dream come true, spanning multiple generations and continents. It is the ultimate honour and responsibility to represent our ancestors and our future generations around the world,"" he told NDTV.
In an official statement, he said that space exploration has inspired him since childhood.
""Leading Axiom Space at this critical inflection point in human spaceflight is the realisation of a lifelong ambition. We are accelerating our investment in next-generation technologies - spacesuits, orbital infrastructure, and microgravity research and manufacturing - and we're actively seeking passionate, visionary engineers, technologists, and entrepreneurs who want to help build humanity's future in space,"" Mr Bhatia, who first worked as Axiom Space's Chief Revenue Officer for four years, said.
It was Mr Bhatia who suggested that the company could help an Indian to fly to space.
""I have almost made it a challenge that if someone tells me something, it's impossible, I will do it just to prove that it's possible, because the reason for doing the impossible is you set the bar for what is possible,"" he said.
""For example, when it was [about] doing the deal with India, people said that's impossible, they're never going to fly, and I was like, I'll just go knock on the door of the embassy. And it's like, you can't do that. And I wasn't going to just knock on the door of the embassy because they told me I couldn't. I actually just showed up and knocked on the door of the embassy,"" he said.
The joint mission got a formal mention when Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited the White House in 2024.
Mr Bhatia said he first heard the calling to work in the space industry when he was three years old and his family visited the Kennedy Space Center.
In the 1990s, he studied computer science at Columbia University with a focus on streaming video. He then worked for ESPN to help launch their first HD streaming of sports online, an innovation that would form the foundation for modern-day streaming services.
He then went on to become the founder and CEO of three of his own companies - Explain Everything, Chatwala, and Kaptur.
He was introduced to Axiom Space for the first time while working for Citi Ventures, Citibank's venture capital arm. He left Citi Ventures for Google and joined Axiom four years later.
Under Mr Bhatia's leadership, Axiom Space will accelerate delivery of the world's first commercial, human-rated space station, leveraging its exclusive authorisation to connect its first module to the International Space Station in 2027.
The Axiom-4 mission crew members are Shubhanshu Shukla (India), Peggy Whitson (US), Slawosz Uznanski-Wisniewski (Poland) and Tibor Kapu (Hungary).

While Ms Whitson, the former NASA astronaut and Axiom Space's Director of Human Spaceflight, will command the commercial mission, Mr Shukla will be the mission pilot.
Slawosz Uznanski-Wisniewski, the European Space Agency project astronaut, and Tibor Kap will be the two mission specialists.
The crew is currently preparing for the flight on the SpaceX Falcon-9 rocket and SpaceX Crew Dragon from Kennedy Space Center in Florida.
Axiom said the mission will ""realise the return"" to human spaceflight for India, Poland, and Hungary, with each nation's first government-sponsored flight in more than 40 years.
While Ax-4 marks these countries' second human spaceflight mission in history, it will be the first time all three nations will execute a mission on board the International Space Station.
On this fully commercial mission, India is paying all the costs for the training and the flight to the ISS. The estimated costs are between $60 and $70 million for the one-off single seat on this private space mission.
India has chosen Group Captain Shukla as the primary astronaut and Group Captain Prasanth Balakrishnan Nair as his backup for the nearly fortnight-long mission.
The partnership between Axiom Space and NASA provided the astronauts with comprehensive instruction and guidance for their mission, leveraging the expertise and resources of both organisations.

These medications, known as GLP-1 drugs, mimic a natural hormone that regulates blood sugar and appetite. However, studies suggest they may also affect parts of the brain related to dopamine, a chemical linked to feelings of pleasure and reward.
According to the research that was published in thejournal Current Neuropharmacology, GLP-1 drugs may disrupt dopamine levels, potentially leading to depression and suicidal thoughts in individuals with low dopamine function. While these medications show promise in treating obesity and diabetes, further investigation is needed to understand their potential impact on mental health.
As per anews release, the study, led by researchers across the United States, Brazil, Iran, and Israel, demonstrates that while GLP1 agonists benefit individuals with hyperdopaminergia (excess dopamine activity), they may have harmful effects on individuals with hypodopaminergia (low dopamine function). The authors found genetic associations between GLP1 receptor agonists and genes such as DRD3, BDNF, and CREB1, which are implicated in mood regulation and reward pathways. Their findings suggest that chronic use of these drugs could dysregulate dopamine signalling, potentially leading to depressive symptoms, mood disturbances, and SI.
While the idea of GLP-1 agonism induction of depression and SI is controversial with both negative and positive reporting, based on the evidence presented in this article by Alireza Sharafshah, a PhD candidate from the Cellular and Molecular Research Centre, School of Medicine, Guilan University of Medical Sciences, Rasht, Iran, the authors caution against promoting chronic stimulation via GLP-1 agonists.
""This study should not be ignored, despite the hype surrounding the positive clinical outcomes of GLP-1 receptor agonists,"" said senior author Dr Kenneth Blum, research professor at Western University Health Sciences and Ariel University. ""We urge the clinical prescribing community to proceed with caution to avoid another tragic wave of 'people dying to lose weight'.""
Dr Mark S Gold, an addiction psychiatry pioneer and co-author, emphasised, ""The paper provides critical evidence for re-evaluating the widespread use of GLP1 receptor agonists. The FDA and other regulatory agencies should carefully consider our findings when it comes to labelling and monitoring these drugs.""

This connection was more pronounced in men and individuals classified as underweight or overweight, suggesting that the distribution of body fat may play a role in mental well-being.
The findings, published in the prestigiousjournal Nature Metabolismon April 15, 2025, are particularly relevant given the rising rates of anxiety and obesity, highlighting the importance of understanding the underlying biological processes.
""Understanding the link between adipose tissue and anxiety opens up new avenues for research and potential treatments,""says Gregory Steinberg, senior author on the paper and a professor in the Department of Medicine at McMaster.
""Our findings highlight the complex interplay between metabolism and mental health, and we hope this will lead to better outcomes for individuals suffering from anxiety,"" says Steinberg, a Canada Research Chair in Metabolism and Obesity and the co-director of the Centre for Metabolism, Obesity and Diabetes Research at McMaster.
As per anews release,the research team discovered that psychological stress, which triggers the fight or flight response, initiates a process called lipolysis in fat cells. This process leads to the release of fats, which in turn stimulate the release of a hormone called GDF15 from immune cells found in the fat tissue. GDF15 then communicates with the brain, resulting in anxiety.
Researchers came to their conclusion through a series of meticulously designed experiments involving mice. Behavioural tests assessed anxiety-like behaviour, and molecular analyses identified the activated pathways. A clear connection between metabolic changes in adipose tissue and anxiety was established, offering new insights into the interplay between metabolism and mental health.
""These findings open up exciting possibilities for developing new treatments for anxiety by focusing on metabolic pathways,"" says Logan Townsend, first author on the paper and a postdoctoral fellow at McMaster.
""By understanding how stress-induced changes in fat cells can influence anxiety, we can explore innovative therapeutic strategies that target these metabolic processes, potentially offering more effective and targeted relief for individuals suffering from anxiety disorders. Several companies are developing blockers of GDF15 for treating cancer, so it is possible these will find use for anxiety as well,"" says Townsend.

https://www.ndtv.com/science/are-earthquakes-hiding-secret-nuclear-tests-new-study-raises-concerns-8260838,Are Earthquakes Hiding Secret Nuclear Tests? New Study Raises Concerns,"Sat, 26 Apr 2025 12:46:12 +0530","A recent review by seismologists at Los Alamos National Laboratory suggests that some earthquakes might actually be covert underground nuclear tests. The study, led by Joshua Carmichael and published in the Bulletin of the Seismological Society of America, highlights the challenges in distinguishing between natural seismic events and clandestine nuclear explosions.
According to a new review articlepublished in the Bulletin of the Seismological Society of Americathat contradicts the conventional wisdom about explosion ""masking.""
Underground nuclear tests can produce seismic signals similar to those of natural earthquakes, making detection difficult. However, advancements in seismic monitoring techniques, such as analyzing the ratio of compressional (P) waves to shear (S) waves, have improved the ability to differentiate between the two. Explosions typically generate more P-waves relative to S-waves compared to earthquakes.
Thenew analysisby Joshua Carmichael and colleagues at Los Alamos National Laboratory found that advanced signal detector technology that can identify a 1.7-ton buried explosion with a 97% success rate only has a 37% success rate when seismic signals from that explosion are hidden within the seismic waveforms of an earthquake that happens within 100 seconds and about 250 kilometers away from the explosion.
The overlapping waveforms of explosion and earthquake ""obfuscate the ability of even the most sensitive digital signal detectors we have to identify that explosion,""said Carmichael.
The findings could lead experts to reconsider a 2012 report that concluded earthquake signals could not cover up explosion signals. Potential explosion masking by natural seismic signals is a concern for the community of scientists charged with nuclear test monitoring around the globe.
In North Korea, which has held six nuclear tests over the past 20 years, an increase in regional seismic instruments shows that ""there's been a lot more low-magnitude seismicity in the vicinity of test sites than we initially realized,"" Carmichael noted.
The new findings suggest that ""background seismicity in regions where there's any sort of seismicity at all is going to measurably and substantially reduce the probability that we can detect signals from an underground explosion at a test site,"" he added.
The researchers also found that natural signals from earthquake swarms or other repeating seismic events could be similarly hidden by overlapping waveforms. In this case, the masking effect dropped detection from a 92% to a 16% detection rate.
""This may mean that we probably underestimate a lot of the low magnitude seismicity that is sourced during a swarm or an aftershock sequence,"" Carmichael said. ""In other words, we could be largely undercounting the number of earthquakes that occur in these swarms or in certain aftershock sequences.""
Explosion masking has been difficult to test because there are so few explosions to examine, and very few data sets that contain both explosion and natural seismic signals.

Scientists Explore Quantum Immortality,"Fri, 25 Apr 2025 20:50:51 +0530","Scientists have proposed a mind-bending concept known as quantum immortality, which suggests that our consciousness may never truly die but instead shift to an alternate reality upon encountering death. This theory is based on physicist Hugh Everett's many-worlds theory, which proposes the existence of multiple parallel universes.
According to researchers, every time we face death in one universe, our consciousness would supposedly transfer to another universe where we survive. This raises intriguing possibilities, including the notion that we may have experienced multiple catastrophic events without being aware of them.
A recent online video by TikTok user @joli.artist has sparked discussion about quantum immortality, with some users exploring its implications and potential consequences. Physicists Frank Pollman and Ruben Verresen have also contributed to the discussion, suggesting that strong interactions can stop decay entirely and lead to sustained oscillations between decay and rebirth.
""Until now, the assumption was that quasiparticles in interacting quantum systems decay after a certain time,""said physicist Frank Pollmanof the Technical University of Munich back in June 2019.
""We now know that the opposite is the case: strong interactions can even stop decay entirely.""
""The result of the elaborate simulation: admittedly, quasiparticles do decay; however, new, identical particle entities emerge from the debris,""said physicist Ruben Verresenof the Technical University of Munich and the Max Planck Institute for the Physics of Complex Systems.
""If this decay proceeds very quickly, an inverse reaction will occur after a certain time, and the debris will converge again. This process can recur endlessly, and a sustained oscillation between decay and rebirth emerges.""
While the concept of quantum immortality is still speculative, it challenges traditional notions of mortality and the nature of consciousness. Further research is needed to fully understand the implications of this theory.

New Study Reveals Shocking Possibility,"Fri, 25 Apr 2025 18:15:47 +0530","A new study by the University of Surrey suggests that time might not be as linear as we think. Researchers propose that, at the quantum level, time could flow in both forward and backward directions simultaneously. This theory challenges our traditional understanding of time's arrow, which assumes time moves irreversibly from past to future.
In a paper published in thejournal Scientific Reports,findings indicate that certain quantum systems can have two arrows of time, one moving forward and another backward. This raises the astonishing possibility that time could be flowing in reverse all around us, and we might not even be aware of it. The discovery could revolutionize our understanding of thermodynamics, quantum mechanics, and the universe's creation.
""Microscopically speaking, if you think about the arrow of time, we essentially rely on proxies,""says the paper's senior author,Andrea Rocco, PhD, associate professor of physics and mathematical biology at the University of Surrey. At the subatomic level where quantum mechanics operates, we can't always see obvious changes that indicate time's passage. Instead, we need to look at other indicators, like entropy.
Dr Andrea Rocco, Associate Professor in Physics and Mathematical Biology at the University of Surrey and lead author of the study, said, ""One way to explain this is when you look at a process like spilled milk spreading across a table, it's clear that time is moving forward. But if you were to play that in reverse, like a movie, you'd immediately know something was wrong-it would be hard to believe milk could just gather back into a glass.
""However, there are processes, such as the motion of a pendulum, that look just as believable in reverse. The puzzle is that, at the most fundamental level, the laws of physics resemble the pendulum; they do not account for irreversible processes.
""Our findings suggest that while our common experience tells us that time only moves one way, we are just unaware that the opposite direction would have been equally possible.""
The study explored how a quantum system-the world of the sub-atomic-interacts with its environment, known as an ""open quantum system.""

The study, involving 3,222 adolescents aged 9 to 14, found that those with slightly better sleep habits (averaging 7 hours, 25 minutes per night) showed noticeable improvements in reading, problem-solving, and focus compared to those with the worst sleep habits (averaging 7 hours, 10 minutes). While there was little difference in academic achievement between the groups, the cognitive benefits of even 15 extra minutes of sleep highlight the importance of sleep quality for adolescent brain development.
""Even though the differences in the amount of sleep that each group got was relatively small, at just over a quarter-of-an-hour between the best and worst sleepers, we could still see differences in brain structure and activity and in how well they did at tasks,""says clinical neuropsychologist Barbara Sahakianfrom the University of Cambridge.
""This drives home to us just how important it is to have a good night's sleep at this important time in life.""
First author Dr Qing Ma from Fudan University said: ""Although our study can't answer conclusively whether young people have better brain function and perform better at tests because they sleep better, there are a number of studies that would support this idea. For example, research has shown the benefits of sleep on memory, especially on memory consolidation, which is important for learning.""
The researchers also assessed the participants' heart rates, finding that Group Three had the lowest heart rates across the sleep states and Group One the highest. Lower heart rates are usually a sign of better health, whereas higher rates often accompany poor sleep quality like restless sleep, frequent awakenings and excessive daytime sleepiness.

The project is part of a Rs 567 crore (50 million pound) government-funded programme under which several small-scale experiments will be conducted to assess the potential of the technology, according to a report inThe Telegraph.
The Advanced Research and Invention Agency (Aria) is backing the solar geoengineering project, which has piqued the interest of scientists worldwide.
""We have strong requirements around the length of time experiments can run for and their reversibility and we won't be funding the release of any toxic substances to the environment,"" said Professor Mark Symes, the programme director for Aria.
One of the experiments involves releasing tiny particles into the stratosphere to reflect sunlight. Another potential solution is marine cloud brightening in which ""ships would spray sea-salt particles into the sky to enhance the reflectivity of low-lying clouds"".
If successful, it could temporarily reduce surface temperatures, delaying the climate crisis and giving more time for the deep cuts in global carbon emissions needed. However, geoengineering projects that seek to artificially alter the climate have proven controversial, with critics arguing that they could have damaging knock-on effects.
Additionally, scientists warn that focusing on these experiments could reduce the drive to tackle the root cause of the climate emergency -- the burning of fossil fuels.

Despite the backlash, Mr Symes is of the view that Earth was reaching a series of tipping points and such experiments were necessary to arrest the slide.
""The uncomfortable truth is that our current warming trajectory makes a number of such tipping points distinctly possible over the next century,"" said Mr Symes.
""This has driven increased interest in approaches that might actively cool the world in a short timeframe in order to avoid those tipping points.""
Apart from outdoor experiments, Aria will be funding new modelling studies, indoor tests, climate monitoring and gauging public attitudes to geoengineering.

In an interview withTime, Mr Hassabis was quizzed about what keeps him up at night, to which he talked about AGI, which was in the final steps of becoming reality.
The 2024 Nobel Prize in Chemistry winner said AI systems capable of human-level cognitive abilities were only five to ten years away.
""For me, it's this question of international standards and cooperation and also not just between countries, but also between companies and researchers as we get towards the final steps of AGI. And I think we are on the cusp of that. Maybe we are five to 10 years out. Some people say shorter, I wouldn't be surprised,"" said Mr Hassabis.
""It's a sort of like probability distribution. But it's coming, either way it's coming very soon and I'm not sure society's quite ready for that yet. And we need to think that through and also think about these issues that I talked about earlier, to do with the controllability of these systems and also the access to these systems and ensuring that all goes well,"" he added.
Sir Demis Hassabis on what keeps him up at night: As we approach ""the final steps toward AGI,"" safety still matters -- but it's coordination that haunts him.""It's coming… and I'm not sure society's ready.""How will countries, companies, and labs align before it's too late?pic.twitter.com/W0WZRmcaM8
This is not the first instance when Mr Hassabis has warned about the perils of AGI. He has previously batted for a UN-like umbrella organisation to oversee AGI's development.
""I would advocate for a kind of CERN for AGI, and by that, I mean a kind of international research focused high-end collaboration on the frontiers of AGI development to try and make that as safe as possible,"" said Mr Hassabis in February.
""You would also have to pair it with a kind of an institute like IAEA, to monitor unsafe projects and sort of deal with those. And finally, some kind of supervening body that involves many countries around the world. So a kind of like UN umbrella, something that is fit for purpose for that, a technical UN,"" he added.

The assessment by the Google executive comes in the backdrop of DeepMind publishing aresearch paperearlier this month, warning that AGI may ""permanently destroy humanity"".
""Given the massive potential impact of AGI, we expect that it too could pose potential risk of severe harm,"" the study highlighted, adding that existential risks that ""permanently destroy humanity"" are clear examples of severe harm.
AGI takes AI a step further. While AI is task-specific, AGI aims to possess intelligence that can be applied across a wide range of tasks, similar to human intelligence. In essence, AGI would be a machine with the ability to understand, learn, and apply knowledge in diverse domains, much like a human being.

The spacecraft was part of the Venera programme to gather information about Venus, but a malfunctioning timer prevented it from completing its mission.
According to satellite tracker Marco Langbroek, the spacecraft is now predicted to re-enter Earth's atmosphere around May 10, give or take a few days.

The spacecraft's fate is uncertain, with experts debating whether it will burn up or survive re-entry. If it survives, it could land between 51.7 degrees north and south latitude, potentially impacting populated areas or oceans.
Orbital updates have resumed (yay!), see my latest forecast here:https://t.co/q006UTzlFhCurrent forecast from our reentry model: 10 May 14:30 UTC +- 2.2 days. Latest model runs are slowly creeping to a slightly later reentry time.pic.twitter.com/jYBNv6ctsg
Kosmos 482 is approximately 480 kilograms and one metre in diameter. Experts are skeptical that the parachute system would still function after all these years, and the heat shield could be damaged. Without the heat shield, the spacecraft would burn up, but if it does persist, a half-tonne metal object will suddenly drop from the sky.
The landing site for the spacecraft is unknown, and there are chance that it will land in the ocean. The event also draws attention to the increasing concern regarding space debris and uncontrolled re-entry risks.

Since the probe was designed to withstand acceleration, high pressures, and extreme heat on Venus, there is a small chance it might survive the reentry when most space objects disintegrate upon entering the Earth's atmosphere.
""As this is a lander that was designed to survive passage through the Venus atmosphere, it is possible it will survive reentry through the Earth atmosphere intact, and impact intact,"" said Mr Langbroek.
""There are many uncertain factors in this though, including that this will be a long shallow reentry trajectory and the age of the object.""
As for where the object will crash on Earth, it is still far too early to tell. However, with an orbital inclination of 51.7 degrees, the reentry can occur anywhere between latitudes 52 degrees north and 52 degrees south. While it is likely that the probe will crash into a water body, there is a small chance it might thud into land.

https://www.ndtv.com/science/is-gravity-the-code-new-theory-suggests-the-universe-is-a-giant-quantum-computer-8288118,Is Gravity The Code? New Theory Suggests The Universe Is A Giant Quantum Computer,"Tue, 29 Apr 2025 20:04:05 +0530","A groundbreaking study proposes that gravity might be a product of computational processes within the universe, hinting that the cosmos could be operating like a giant quantum computer. Physicist Melvin Vopson from the University of Portsmouth suggests that gravity could be a by-product of the universe's attempt to organize information and matter in space and time.
Thisnew theoryraises intriguing questions about the nature of reality and whether we are living in a simulated environment. If proven true, it could revolutionize our understanding of the universe and its underlying mechanisms.
Dr Melvin Vopsonsuggeststhat gravity might actually be caused by how information about matter is organised in the universe. Using the second law of information dynamics, he indicates that matter and objects in space may be being pulled together because the universe is trying to keep information tidy and compressed.
Dr Vopson said: ""My findings in this study fit with the thought that the universe might work like a giant computer, or our reality is a simulated construct. Just like computers try to save space and run more efficiently, the universe might be doing the same. It's a new way to think about gravity - not just as a pull, but as something that happens when the universe is trying to stay organised.""
Dr Vopson has previously published research suggesting that information has mass and that all elementary particles - the smallest known building blocks of the universe - store information about themselves, similar to the way cells, the building blocks of biological entities, have DNA.
In this latest research, Dr Vopson shows how space pixelation in elementary cells can act as a data storage medium, and demonstrates how the role of information stored in elementary cells is to provide the properties and the coordinates of matter in the space-time simulated construct. Each cell can register information in the form of binary data so if it is empty it registers a digital ""0"", and if matter is present in a cell it registers a digital ""1"".
Dr Vopson added: ""The process is identical to how a digital computer game, virtual reality application, or other advanced simulation would be designed.""
He explains that as a cell can accommodate more than one particle, then the system will evolve itself by moving the particles in space to join them together into a single larger particle inside a single cell.
""This triggers the attracting force because of the rule set in the computational system, requiring the minimisation of the information content, and by extension, a reduction of the computational power. Put simply, it is far more computationally effective to track and compute the location and momentum of a single object in space, than numerous objects. Therefore, it appears that the gravitational attraction is just another optimising mechanism in a computational process that has the role to compress information.""

Under a Rs 6.04 crore (585,000 Swiss francs) pilot project, as many as 48 solar panels have been placed on a 100-metre portion of railway tracks in Buttes, a small village in western Switzerland.
The technology has been developed by Sun-Ways after its founder, Joseph Scuderi, first had the idea in 2020 while waiting for a train. After receiving a green light from the Federal Office of Transport (FOT), the startup deployed the solar panels on the railway line, currently being operated by transN.
""We installed solar panels as we would on the roof of a house,"" Mr Scuderi toldSwissinfo, adding that getting this far ""has been a miracle"".
Notably, the project was initially rejected by FOT in 2023 over concerns that the solar panels could affect the safety of the trains and related maintenance efforts. However, Sun-Ways consulted experts to conduct an independent study on the proposal to prove that the specialised solar panels would not interfere with the active railway.
While solar panels are usually permanently fixed, Sun-Ways has developed a proprietary technology where the panels can be removed whenever required so that the track maintenance team can perform its job. Swiss track maintenance company Scheuchzer can place and remove nearly 1,000 square metres of solar panels in just a few hours.

As per the company, the photovoltaic current produced by the solar panels could be used in three ways. In the first scenario, the energy could be ""reinjected"" to power the railway infrastructure (switches, signals, stations) while in second instance, the current can be fed into the electricity network of the nearest local GRD (Distribution Network Operator).
However, Sun-Ways claims that reinjecting the current into the traction energy network that powers the locomotives is the best way to extract the full benefits of the pilot programme. Sun-Ways says the approximately 5,320 kilometres of the Swiss rail network could generate one billion kWh of solar power per year, which is enough to fulfil the consumption demand of 300,000 households.
""It is good that rail and public transport companies are innovating, including in renewable energy production,"" said Florence Pictet, spokesperson for the FOT.
Sun-Ways says it has already received interest from countries such as China and the US while collaborating on similar projects in South Korea, Spain and Romania.

UK Scientist Makes Bold Claim,"Tue, 29 Apr 2025 11:30:34 +0530","Are we living in a simulated reality like in the movie'The Matrix'?Dr. Melvin Vopson, a UK-based physicist, suggests that gravity might be evidence we're living in a virtual world, with the universe acting like a giant computer. His theory echoes the 1999 film's concept of a simulated universe, but with a scientific twist.Dr. Vopson's researchsuggests that gravity might be a form of data organisation, similar to computer code compression. He proposes that the universe's tendency to pull objects with mass towards the Earth's core is analogous to how computers optimise data, supporting the idea that our universe could be a simulated or computational construct.
""The universe evolves in a way that the information content in it is compressed, optimised and organised – just as computers and computer code do. Hence, gravity appears to be another process of data compression in a possibly simulated universe,"" he told theDaily Mail.
According to the study, gravity reduces ""information entropy,"" or the amount of information an object holds in a given space. Gravity shapes galaxies, orbits planets around stars, and affects nearby objects' motion. In Dr Vopson's theory, gravity pulls objects together as the universe strives to keep information organised and compressed.
""To put it simply, it is easier to compute all the properties and characteristics of a single object in space, rather than multiple objects. That is why objects in space are pulled together,"" Dr Vopson added.
Dr. Vopson's idea builds on hisprevious workon entropy in information theory, which likely explores how information systems tend to become more disordered or complex over time.
""A super complex universe like ours, if it were a simulation, would require a built-in data optimisation and compression to reduce the computational power and the data storage requirements to run the simulation. This is exactly what we are observing all around us, including in digital data, biological systems, mathematical symmetries and the entire universe,"" heexplained in 2023.
This time, he shifted his focus from biological systems to gravity, exploring its potential connection to information theory and the simulated universe hypothesis.
""My findings in this study fit with the thought that the universe might work like a giant computer, or our reality is a simulated construct. Just like computers try to save space and run more efficiently, the universe might be doing the same.

The images of the ""lunar transit"" show in its entirety, before a large dark orb - moon - passes by, blocking almost a quarter of the star from view.
NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)is a semi-autonomous spacecraft that points at the sun, allowing almost continuous observation. The satellite was launched in February 2010. Since then, it has observed multiple lunar transits, or eclipses, many of which are not visible from Earth.
According to NASA, there will be another eclipse on May 25 that will cover only four per cent of the sun. Another eclipse is due on July 25, which is expected to cover 62% of the sun.
This is not the first time an eclipse has been seen by SDO or by astronauts in space. According to Forbes, several Apollo astronauts witnessed an eclipse of the sun as they travelled to the moon.

According to food researchers at the Technical University of Munich, a mushroom calledAmaropostia stiptica, better known as bitter bracket fungus, is officially the 'most bitter thing in the world', as per a report in theBBC.
The mushroom is widely available in Britain, and despite being extremely bitter, it is not toxic. The researchers extracted three compounds from the mushroom and studied their effect on human taste receptors.
This tree-growing mushroom has a compound that is so potent that an individual would be able to taste a single gram of the substance dissolved in 106 bathtubs of water. Named oligoporin D, this chemical activates specialised bitter receptors in our mouths which also help detect natural poisons.

""Our results contribute to expanding our knowledge of the molecular diversity and mode of action of natural bitter compounds,"" said lead researcher Dr Maik Behrens.
""In the long term, insights in this area could enable new applications in food and health research, for example in the development of sensorially appealing foods that positively influence digestion and satiety.""
Prior to the German study, most of the research had centred around how flowering plants can have a bitter taste. However, fewer studies had been done looking at fungi such as mushrooms.
Studies show that sensors for bitter substances are also found in the stomach, intestines, heart and lungs apart from the mouth.
Previous studies have indicated that sensors for bitter substances are not only found in the mouth but also in the stomach, intestines, heart and lungs. Researchers stated that closely analysing compounds derived from fungi like oligoporin D could be key to understanding our complex relationship with bitterness.

Enterprises collect petabytes of logs, alerts, and telemetry - but typically analyze less than 5% of it. That small slice often misses the most critical signals. Reef intelligently filters, identifies, contextualizes, and prioritizes high-value data in real time, writing it directly to enterprise-owned data lakes infrastructure.
The result: meaningful insights delivered instantly to security analysts and decision-makers.
""Security teams don't need more dashboards - they need answers, they need insights,"" saidMihir Nair, Head of Architecture & Innovation at DataBahn.ai. ""We've harnessed GenAI to reimagine how teams interact with data - delivering relevant intelligence the moment it's needed. Our new Model Context Protocol (MCP) Server advances this vision even further. It helps to seamlessly integrate Reef withCruz AI- DataBahn.ai's Data Engineer. With a single prompt, users can uncover configurations, inventories, and anomalies - driving faster, smarter decisions.""
5 to 60 minutes - that's how long data searches used to take. With Reef, it's a matter of seconds.
Built on DataBahn.ai's modular Security Data Fabric, Reef unifies telemetry from all sources into a centralized, searchable metadata layer accessible via natural language. This makes security data not only usable but useful for SOC analysts, threat hunters, infrastructure teams, auditors, and even AI systems.

Using the Korea Microlensing Telescope Network (KMTNet), an international team of researchers has discovered that super-Earth exoplanets are more common across the universe than previously thought, according to a new study.
By studying light anomalies made by the newly found planet's host star and combining their results with a larger sample from a KMTNet microlensing survey, the team found that super-Earths can exist as far from their host star as our gas giants are from the sun, said Andrew Gould, co-author of the study and professor emeritus of astronomy at The Ohio State University.
""Scientists knew there were more small planets than big planets, but in this study, we were able to show that within this overall pattern, there are excesses and deficits,"" he said. ""It's very interesting.""
While it can be relatively easy to locate worlds that orbit close to their star, planets with wider paths can be difficult to detect.
Still, researchers further estimated that for every three stars, there should be at least one super-Earth present with a Jupiter-like orbital period, suggesting these massive worlds are extremely prevalent across the universe, said Gould, whose early theoretical research helped develop the field of planetary microlensing.
The findings in this study were made via microlensing, an observational effect that occurs when the presence of mass warps the fabric of space-time to a detectable degree.
When a foreground object, such as a star or planet, passes between an observer and a more distant star, light is curved from the source, causing an apparent increase in the object's brightness that can last anywhere from a few hours to several months.

As per a new study published on the preprint serverarXiv, the Great Wall, which is located 10 billion light-years from Earth, could be as large as 15 billion light-years in size, up from the previous estimate of 10 billion light-years long.
Using a recently developed methodology, scientists re-examined the Great Wall, which was first discovered, more than a decade ago.
""Evidence is provided that the Hercules-Corona Borealis Great Wall cluster is larger than previously thought. The extension of this cluster's size does not appear to have been due to statistical variations or sampling biases,"" the study highlighted.
By analysing the gamma-ray bursts that are produced during extreme cosmic events such as the collapse of a supernova, the birth of a black hole, or the collision of two neutron stars, scientists managed to figure out the new length of the Great Wall.
The team examined 542 gamma-ray bursts with known redshifts, which showed that the Great Wall may extend from a redshift of 0.33 to a redshift of 2.43 -- a total distance of around 15 billion light-years
""We also found evidence that the Hercules-Corona Borealis Great Wall is larger than previously identified and that it appears to encompass several smaller clusters,"" it added.

In February this year, scientists claimed to have discovered another large superstructure called Quipu, believed to measure 1.3 billion light-years across, which is over 13,000 times the length of the Milky Way.
As per the study, Quipu is responsible for a ""large part of the gravitational pull that causes the peculiar motion of the Local Group with respect to the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) frame"". However, more information is needed to identify the effects of such a structure on its neighbourhood.
The scientists added that while the superstructure was massive in size currently, it would soon collapse and form independent units.
Studying an object as massive as the Great Wall or Quipu could help scientists broaden their understanding of how galaxies evolve and improve the existing cosmological models.

The Houston-based company has been contracted by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and NASA to fly Group Captain Shukla to the space station next month.
Mr Bhatia, whose parents immigrated from India to New York in 1970, is a former Google executive and a Columbia University graduate.
""The opportunity to work with India on the Axiom-4 mission and its future space ambitions is a dream come true, spanning multiple generations and continents. It is the ultimate honour and responsibility to represent our ancestors and our future generations around the world,"" he told NDTV.
In an official statement, he said that space exploration has inspired him since childhood.
""Leading Axiom Space at this critical inflection point in human spaceflight is the realisation of a lifelong ambition. We are accelerating our investment in next-generation technologies - spacesuits, orbital infrastructure, and microgravity research and manufacturing - and we're actively seeking passionate, visionary engineers, technologists, and entrepreneurs who want to help build humanity's future in space,"" Mr Bhatia, who first worked as Axiom Space's Chief Revenue Officer for four years, said.
It was Mr Bhatia who suggested that the company could help an Indian to fly to space.
""I have almost made it a challenge that if someone tells me something, it's impossible, I will do it just to prove that it's possible, because the reason for doing the impossible is you set the bar for what is possible,"" he said.
""For example, when it was [about] doing the deal with India, people said that's impossible, they're never going to fly, and I was like, I'll just go knock on the door of the embassy. And it's like, you can't do that. And I wasn't going to just knock on the door of the embassy because they told me I couldn't. I actually just showed up and knocked on the door of the embassy,"" he said.
The joint mission got a formal mention when Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited the White House in 2024.
Mr Bhatia said he first heard the calling to work in the space industry when he was three years old and his family visited the Kennedy Space Center.
In the 1990s, he studied computer science at Columbia University with a focus on streaming video. He then worked for ESPN to help launch their first HD streaming of sports online, an innovation that would form the foundation for modern-day streaming services.
He then went on to become the founder and CEO of three of his own companies - Explain Everything, Chatwala, and Kaptur.
He was introduced to Axiom Space for the first time while working for Citi Ventures, Citibank's venture capital arm. He left Citi Ventures for Google and joined Axiom four years later.
Under Mr Bhatia's leadership, Axiom Space will accelerate delivery of the world's first commercial, human-rated space station, leveraging its exclusive authorisation to connect its first module to the International Space Station in 2027.
The Axiom-4 mission crew members are Shubhanshu Shukla (India), Peggy Whitson (US), Slawosz Uznanski-Wisniewski (Poland) and Tibor Kapu (Hungary).

While Ms Whitson, the former NASA astronaut and Axiom Space's Director of Human Spaceflight, will command the commercial mission, Mr Shukla will be the mission pilot.
Slawosz Uznanski-Wisniewski, the European Space Agency project astronaut, and Tibor Kap will be the two mission specialists.
The crew is currently preparing for the flight on the SpaceX Falcon-9 rocket and SpaceX Crew Dragon from Kennedy Space Center in Florida.
Axiom said the mission will ""realise the return"" to human spaceflight for India, Poland, and Hungary, with each nation's first government-sponsored flight in more than 40 years.
While Ax-4 marks these countries' second human spaceflight mission in history, it will be the first time all three nations will execute a mission on board the International Space Station.
On this fully commercial mission, India is paying all the costs for the training and the flight to the ISS. The estimated costs are between $60 and $70 million for the one-off single seat on this private space mission.
India has chosen Group Captain Shukla as the primary astronaut and Group Captain Prasanth Balakrishnan Nair as his backup for the nearly fortnight-long mission.
The partnership between Axiom Space and NASA provided the astronauts with comprehensive instruction and guidance for their mission, leveraging the expertise and resources of both organisations.

These medications, known as GLP-1 drugs, mimic a natural hormone that regulates blood sugar and appetite. However, studies suggest they may also affect parts of the brain related to dopamine, a chemical linked to feelings of pleasure and reward.
According to the research that was published in thejournal Current Neuropharmacology, GLP-1 drugs may disrupt dopamine levels, potentially leading to depression and suicidal thoughts in individuals with low dopamine function. While these medications show promise in treating obesity and diabetes, further investigation is needed to understand their potential impact on mental health.
As per anews release, the study, led by researchers across the United States, Brazil, Iran, and Israel, demonstrates that while GLP1 agonists benefit individuals with hyperdopaminergia (excess dopamine activity), they may have harmful effects on individuals with hypodopaminergia (low dopamine function). The authors found genetic associations between GLP1 receptor agonists and genes such as DRD3, BDNF, and CREB1, which are implicated in mood regulation and reward pathways. Their findings suggest that chronic use of these drugs could dysregulate dopamine signalling, potentially leading to depressive symptoms, mood disturbances, and SI.
While the idea of GLP-1 agonism induction of depression and SI is controversial with both negative and positive reporting, based on the evidence presented in this article by Alireza Sharafshah, a PhD candidate from the Cellular and Molecular Research Centre, School of Medicine, Guilan University of Medical Sciences, Rasht, Iran, the authors caution against promoting chronic stimulation via GLP-1 agonists.
""This study should not be ignored, despite the hype surrounding the positive clinical outcomes of GLP-1 receptor agonists,"" said senior author Dr Kenneth Blum, research professor at Western University Health Sciences and Ariel University. ""We urge the clinical prescribing community to proceed with caution to avoid another tragic wave of 'people dying to lose weight'.""
Dr Mark S Gold, an addiction psychiatry pioneer and co-author, emphasised, ""The paper provides critical evidence for re-evaluating the widespread use of GLP1 receptor agonists. The FDA and other regulatory agencies should carefully consider our findings when it comes to labelling and monitoring these drugs.""

https://www.ndtv.com/science/body-fat-may-increase-risk-of-anxiety-and-depression-study-8262826,Body Fat May Increase Risk Of Anxiety And Depression: Study,"Sat, 26 Apr 2025 17:48:40 +0530","A new study found a correlation between higher percentages of body fat, particularly in the legs, gynoid region, and head, and increased symptoms of depression. This connection was more pronounced in men and individuals classified as underweight or overweight, suggesting that the distribution of body fat may play a role in mental well-being.
The findings, published in the prestigiousjournal Nature Metabolismon April 15, 2025, are particularly relevant given the rising rates of anxiety and obesity, highlighting the importance of understanding the underlying biological processes.
""Understanding the link between adipose tissue and anxiety opens up new avenues for research and potential treatments,""says Gregory Steinberg, senior author on the paper and a professor in the Department of Medicine at McMaster.
""Our findings highlight the complex interplay between metabolism and mental health, and we hope this will lead to better outcomes for individuals suffering from anxiety,"" says Steinberg, a Canada Research Chair in Metabolism and Obesity and the co-director of the Centre for Metabolism, Obesity and Diabetes Research at McMaster.
As per anews release,the research team discovered that psychological stress, which triggers the fight or flight response, initiates a process called lipolysis in fat cells. This process leads to the release of fats, which in turn stimulate the release of a hormone called GDF15 from immune cells found in the fat tissue. GDF15 then communicates with the brain, resulting in anxiety.
Researchers came to their conclusion through a series of meticulously designed experiments involving mice. Behavioural tests assessed anxiety-like behaviour, and molecular analyses identified the activated pathways. A clear connection between metabolic changes in adipose tissue and anxiety was established, offering new insights into the interplay between metabolism and mental health.
""These findings open up exciting possibilities for developing new treatments for anxiety by focusing on metabolic pathways,"" says Logan Townsend, first author on the paper and a postdoctoral fellow at McMaster.
""By understanding how stress-induced changes in fat cells can influence anxiety, we can explore innovative therapeutic strategies that target these metabolic processes, potentially offering more effective and targeted relief for individuals suffering from anxiety disorders. Several companies are developing blockers of GDF15 for treating cancer, so it is possible these will find use for anxiety as well,"" says Townsend.

https://www.ndtv.com/science/are-earthquakes-hiding-secret-nuclear-tests-new-study-raises-concerns-8260838,Are Earthquakes Hiding Secret Nuclear Tests? New Study Raises Concerns,"Sat, 26 Apr 2025 12:46:12 +0530","A recent review by seismologists at Los Alamos National Laboratory suggests that some earthquakes might actually be covert underground nuclear tests. The study, led by Joshua Carmichael and published in the Bulletin of the Seismological Society of America, highlights the challenges in distinguishing between natural seismic events and clandestine nuclear explosions.
According to a new review articlepublished in the Bulletin of the Seismological Society of Americathat contradicts the conventional wisdom about explosion ""masking.""
Underground nuclear tests can produce seismic signals similar to those of natural earthquakes, making detection difficult. However, advancements in seismic monitoring techniques, such as analyzing the ratio of compressional (P) waves to shear (S) waves, have improved the ability to differentiate between the two. Explosions typically generate more P-waves relative to S-waves compared to earthquakes.
Thenew analysisby Joshua Carmichael and colleagues at Los Alamos National Laboratory found that advanced signal detector technology that can identify a 1.7-ton buried explosion with a 97% success rate only has a 37% success rate when seismic signals from that explosion are hidden within the seismic waveforms of an earthquake that happens within 100 seconds and about 250 kilometers away from the explosion.
The overlapping waveforms of explosion and earthquake ""obfuscate the ability of even the most sensitive digital signal detectors we have to identify that explosion,""said Carmichael.
The findings could lead experts to reconsider a 2012 report that concluded earthquake signals could not cover up explosion signals. Potential explosion masking by natural seismic signals is a concern for the community of scientists charged with nuclear test monitoring around the globe.
In North Korea, which has held six nuclear tests over the past 20 years, an increase in regional seismic instruments shows that ""there's been a lot more low-magnitude seismicity in the vicinity of test sites than we initially realized,"" Carmichael noted.
The new findings suggest that ""background seismicity in regions where there's any sort of seismicity at all is going to measurably and substantially reduce the probability that we can detect signals from an underground explosion at a test site,"" he added.
The researchers also found that natural signals from earthquake swarms or other repeating seismic events could be similarly hidden by overlapping waveforms. In this case, the masking effect dropped detection from a 92% to a 16% detection rate.
""This may mean that we probably underestimate a lot of the low magnitude seismicity that is sourced during a swarm or an aftershock sequence,"" Carmichael said. ""In other words, we could be largely undercounting the number of earthquakes that occur in these swarms or in certain aftershock sequences.""
Explosion masking has been difficult to test because there are so few explosions to examine, and very few data sets that contain both explosion and natural seismic signals.

https://www.ndtv.com/science/what-if-you-could-live-forever-scientists-explore-quantum-immortality-8256399,What If You Could Live Forever? Scientists Explore Quantum Immortality,"Fri, 25 Apr 2025 20:50:51 +0530","Scientists have proposed a mind-bending concept known as quantum immortality, which suggests that our consciousness may never truly die but instead shift to an alternate reality upon encountering death. This theory is based on physicist Hugh Everett's many-worlds theory, which proposes the existence of multiple parallel universes.
According to researchers, every time we face death in one universe, our consciousness would supposedly transfer to another universe where we survive. This raises intriguing possibilities, including the notion that we may have experienced multiple catastrophic events without being aware of them.
A recent online video by TikTok user @joli.artist has sparked discussion about quantum immortality, with some users exploring its implications and potential consequences. Physicists Frank Pollman and Ruben Verresen have also contributed to the discussion, suggesting that strong interactions can stop decay entirely and lead to sustained oscillations between decay and rebirth.
""Until now, the assumption was that quasiparticles in interacting quantum systems decay after a certain time,""said physicist Frank Pollmanof the Technical University of Munich back in June 2019.
""We now know that the opposite is the case: strong interactions can even stop decay entirely.""
""The result of the elaborate simulation: admittedly, quasiparticles do decay; however, new, identical particle entities emerge from the debris,""said physicist Ruben Verresenof the Technical University of Munich and the Max Planck Institute for the Physics of Complex Systems.
""If this decay proceeds very quickly, an inverse reaction will occur after a certain time, and the debris will converge again. This process can recur endlessly, and a sustained oscillation between decay and rebirth emerges.""
While the concept of quantum immortality is still speculative, it challenges traditional notions of mortality and the nature of consciousness. Further research is needed to fully understand the implications of this theory.

New Study Reveals Shocking Possibility,"Fri, 25 Apr 2025 18:15:47 +0530","A new study by the University of Surrey suggests that time might not be as linear as we think. Researchers propose that, at the quantum level, time could flow in both forward and backward directions simultaneously. This theory challenges our traditional understanding of time's arrow, which assumes time moves irreversibly from past to future.
In a paper published in thejournal Scientific Reports,findings indicate that certain quantum systems can have two arrows of time, one moving forward and another backward. This raises the astonishing possibility that time could be flowing in reverse all around us, and we might not even be aware of it. The discovery could revolutionize our understanding of thermodynamics, quantum mechanics, and the universe's creation.
""Microscopically speaking, if you think about the arrow of time, we essentially rely on proxies,""says the paper's senior author,Andrea Rocco, PhD, associate professor of physics and mathematical biology at the University of Surrey. At the subatomic level where quantum mechanics operates, we can't always see obvious changes that indicate time's passage. Instead, we need to look at other indicators, like entropy.
Dr Andrea Rocco, Associate Professor in Physics and Mathematical Biology at the University of Surrey and lead author of the study, said, ""One way to explain this is when you look at a process like spilled milk spreading across a table, it's clear that time is moving forward. But if you were to play that in reverse, like a movie, you'd immediately know something was wrong-it would be hard to believe milk could just gather back into a glass.
""However, there are processes, such as the motion of a pendulum, that look just as believable in reverse. The puzzle is that, at the most fundamental level, the laws of physics resemble the pendulum; they do not account for irreversible processes.
""Our findings suggest that while our common experience tells us that time only moves one way, we are just unaware that the opposite direction would have been equally possible.""
The study explored how a quantum system-the world of the sub-atomic-interacts with its environment, known as an ""open quantum system.""

The study, involving 3,222 adolescents aged 9 to 14, found that those with slightly better sleep habits (averaging 7 hours, 25 minutes per night) showed noticeable improvements in reading, problem-solving, and focus compared to those with the worst sleep habits (averaging 7 hours, 10 minutes). While there was little difference in academic achievement between the groups, the cognitive benefits of even 15 extra minutes of sleep highlight the importance of sleep quality for adolescent brain development.
""Even though the differences in the amount of sleep that each group got was relatively small, at just over a quarter-of-an-hour between the best and worst sleepers, we could still see differences in brain structure and activity and in how well they did at tasks,""says clinical neuropsychologist Barbara Sahakianfrom the University of Cambridge.
""This drives home to us just how important it is to have a good night's sleep at this important time in life.""
First author Dr Qing Ma from Fudan University said: ""Although our study can't answer conclusively whether young people have better brain function and perform better at tests because they sleep better, there are a number of studies that would support this idea. For example, research has shown the benefits of sleep on memory, especially on memory consolidation, which is important for learning.""
The researchers also assessed the participants' heart rates, finding that Group Three had the lowest heart rates across the sleep states and Group One the highest. Lower heart rates are usually a sign of better health, whereas higher rates often accompany poor sleep quality like restless sleep, frequent awakenings and excessive daytime sleepiness.

The project is part of a Rs 567 crore (50 million pound) government-funded programme under which several small-scale experiments will be conducted to assess the potential of the technology, according to a report inThe Telegraph.
The Advanced Research and Invention Agency (Aria) is backing the solar geoengineering project, which has piqued the interest of scientists worldwide.
""We have strong requirements around the length of time experiments can run for and their reversibility and we won't be funding the release of any toxic substances to the environment,"" said Professor Mark Symes, the programme director for Aria.
One of the experiments involves releasing tiny particles into the stratosphere to reflect sunlight. Another potential solution is marine cloud brightening in which ""ships would spray sea-salt particles into the sky to enhance the reflectivity of low-lying clouds"".
If successful, it could temporarily reduce surface temperatures, delaying the climate crisis and giving more time for the deep cuts in global carbon emissions needed. However, geoengineering projects that seek to artificially alter the climate have proven controversial, with critics arguing that they could have damaging knock-on effects.
Additionally, scientists warn that focusing on these experiments could reduce the drive to tackle the root cause of the climate emergency -- the burning of fossil fuels.

Despite the backlash, Mr Symes is of the view that Earth was reaching a series of tipping points and such experiments were necessary to arrest the slide.
""The uncomfortable truth is that our current warming trajectory makes a number of such tipping points distinctly possible over the next century,"" said Mr Symes.
""This has driven increased interest in approaches that might actively cool the world in a short timeframe in order to avoid those tipping points.""
Apart from outdoor experiments, Aria will be funding new modelling studies, indoor tests, climate monitoring and gauging public attitudes to geoengineering.

In an interview withTime, Mr Hassabis was quizzed about what keeps him up at night, to which he talked about AGI, which was in the final steps of becoming reality.
The 2024 Nobel Prize in Chemistry winner said AI systems capable of human-level cognitive abilities were only five to ten years away.
""For me, it's this question of international standards and cooperation and also not just between countries, but also between companies and researchers as we get towards the final steps of AGI. And I think we are on the cusp of that. Maybe we are five to 10 years out. Some people say shorter, I wouldn't be surprised,"" said Mr Hassabis.
""It's a sort of like probability distribution. But it's coming, either way it's coming very soon and I'm not sure society's quite ready for that yet. And we need to think that through and also think about these issues that I talked about earlier, to do with the controllability of these systems and also the access to these systems and ensuring that all goes well,"" he added.
Sir Demis Hassabis on what keeps him up at night: As we approach ""the final steps toward AGI,"" safety still matters -- but it's coordination that haunts him.""It's coming… and I'm not sure society's ready.""How will countries, companies, and labs align before it's too late?pic.twitter.com/W0WZRmcaM8
This is not the first instance when Mr Hassabis has warned about the perils of AGI. He has previously batted for a UN-like umbrella organisation to oversee AGI's development.
""I would advocate for a kind of CERN for AGI, and by that, I mean a kind of international research focused high-end collaboration on the frontiers of AGI development to try and make that as safe as possible,"" said Mr Hassabis in February.
""You would also have to pair it with a kind of an institute like IAEA, to monitor unsafe projects and sort of deal with those. And finally, some kind of supervening body that involves many countries around the world. So a kind of like UN umbrella, something that is fit for purpose for that, a technical UN,"" he added.

The assessment by the Google executive comes in the backdrop of DeepMind publishing aresearch paperearlier this month, warning that AGI may ""permanently destroy humanity"".
""Given the massive potential impact of AGI, we expect that it too could pose potential risk of severe harm,"" the study highlighted, adding that existential risks that ""permanently destroy humanity"" are clear examples of severe harm.
AGI takes AI a step further. While AI is task-specific, AGI aims to possess intelligence that can be applied across a wide range of tasks, similar to human intelligence. In essence, AGI would be a machine with the ability to understand, learn, and apply knowledge in diverse domains, much like a human being.

While the exoplanet was first spotted in 2020, an international team of researchers last week published their findings about it. Using the Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) aboard the JWST, the scientists stated that temperatures reached a frigid -125 degrees Fahrenheit (-87 degrees Celsius), making it the coldest planet ever directly observed.
""We were all a bit surprised - and excited - to find that it was, in fact, a planet, and a really cold one at that,"" Mary Anne Limbach, an astronomer at the University of Michigan, who led the new study toldSpace.com.
The previous record for the coldest planet was held by Epsilon Indi Ab, which stands at around 35 degrees Fahrenheit (2 degrees Celsius).
""The detection of WD 1856 b, with its sub-200 K temperature, marks significant progress in directly detecting exoplanets with thermal emission similar in temperature to Solar System gas giants,"" thestudyhighlighted.

The researchers further confirmed that the exoplanet has a mass no greater than six times that of Jupiter and orbits the remnant core of a once sun-like star, every 1.4 days. Scientists added that it was the first intact exoplanet to have been found in the forbidden zone of a star.
""WD 1856+534 b is now the first intact exoplanet confirmed within a white dwarf's ""forbidden zone,"" a region where planets would have been engulfed during the star's red giant phase. Its presence provides direct evidence that planetary migration into close orbits-including the habitable zone-around white dwarfs is possible.""
Ms Limbach said their findings provide ""compelling evidence"" that not only can planets survive the violent death of their star but also move into orbits where previously they would have not expected them to exist.
Buoyed by the success, the researchers are hoping that JWST's full potential could be used to directly image even colder gas giants in closer systems with ""temperatures as low as 75 K"".
This capability could provide an opportunity to explore the atmospheres and thermal properties of planets with temperatures comparable to the coldest gas giants in our Solar System.

The Axiom-4 space mission of four crew members will conduct research which may pave the way for diabetics to be included in the global astronaut corps. The study will be undertaken in micro-gravity conditions of the International Space Station during the fortnight-long mission.
The experiment is called the ""Suite Ride"" initiative, and the effort marks a significant milestone in the long-term goal of supporting future astronauts with insulin-dependent diabetes (IDDM), a condition historically deemed disqualifying for spaceflight.
The experiment is part of Axiom Space's multi-tiered approach, which aims to eventually demonstrate that astronauts with IDDM can be safely monitored, treated, and participate in off-planet missions.
One person who will be keenly watching this experiment is India's Science Minister, Dr Jitendra Singh, a well-known diabetologist.
The principal investigator for the study, Dr. Mohammad Fityan, Chief Medical Officer at Burjeel Holdings, Abu Dhabi, confirmed that no astronaut will be injected with insulin, but the crew will wear glucose monitoring equipment on the space flight to see how blood glucose levels fluctuate in the 'stressful environment of space'.
They will be validating blood glucose monitoring, data transmission, as well as insulin viability aboard the International Space Station, he added.
According to a 2024 World Health Organisation estimate, 14% of adults aged 18 years and older were living with diabetes, an increase from 7% in 1990, and about 830 million people worldwide have diabetes.
India is considered the diabetes capital of the world. WHO figures suggest there are an estimated 77 million people above the age of suffering from diabetes (type 2) in India, and nearly 25 million are pre-diabetics, i.e, those at a higher risk of developing diabetes in the future.
Burjeel Holdings PLC, a leading super-speciality healthcare provider in the Middle East and the North African region with headquarters in Abu Dhabi, which is spearheading the project, said, They will do groundbreaking mission-focused work on diabetes management in microgravity, along with Axiom Space.
A pivotal moment in this research was the successful technical demonstration conducted on the Galactic 07 mission of 2024, which confirmed that commercially available insulin pens can deliver medication effectively in microgravity, adhering to International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO) guidelines. The promising results have laid the foundation for the upcoming mission that will take place in space.
The Axiom-4 (Ax-4) mission will utilise Continuous Glucose Monitors (CGMs), which have become the standard for glucose monitoring in individuals with diabetes. These devices will be tested to ensure their accuracy in microgravity, providing real-time data that will ultimately support the health of astronauts with insulin-dependent diabetes.
The comprehensive preflight, inflight, and post-flight protocols will employ various testing methods to validate these technologies. The Ax-4 mission also plans to look at insulin exposure in microgravity to assess the potency and stability of the drug product upon its return to Earth.
Testing the behaviour of CGMs and insulin delivery technologies in microgravity and with circadian rhythm disruption is expected to advance the understanding of how such innovations can improve diabetes monitoring and care in remote or underserved areas on Earth. Experts say this research will lay the groundwork for managing diabetes in isolated locations, such as oil rigs, deserts, or rural regions.
Dr Fityan said, ""Space is a proving ground, as this research aims to provide invaluable data that will directly benefit underserved communities and difficult-to-reach areas across the globe.""
Dr Lucie Low, Chief Scientist, Axiom Space, said, ""This may pave the way for the eventual flight of an astronaut with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus IDDM. The successful demonstration of glucose monitoring on subjects without diabetes will next open the door to flying astronauts with non-insulin-dependent Type 2 diabetes, looking to prove that people with diabetes can one day thrive in the unique environment of space.""
Dr. Low added that ""I am personally very excited about our 'Suite Ride' experiment because for Axiom, it means that we are enabling new opportunities for a more diverse crew to fly a future, as well as translating those results back into, hopefully, impacts for diabetic patients here on Earth.""

For 18 years, starting in 2001, California-based Tim Friede got himself knowingly bitten by some of the most venomous snakes on the planet in hopes of finding a cure for all snake bites.
According to a report inCNN, antibodies found in Mr Friede's blood have now been shown to protect against fatal doses from a wide range of species in animal tests.
Immunologist Jacob Glanville first heard about Mr Friede through media reports in 2017 and decided that there was an opportunity to do something groundbreaking.
""We had this conversation. And I said, I know it's awkward, but I'm really interested in looking at some of your blood,"" said Mr Glanville. ""And he [Tim Friede] said, 'Finally, I've been waiting for this call.'""
As the pair began working together, Mr Friede donated a 40-millilitre blood sample to Mr Glanville and his colleagues. Eight years later, Mr Glanville and Peter Kwong, Richard J. Stock, Professor of medical sciences at Columbia University's Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons havepublisheddetails of the antivenom that can protect against the bites from 19 species of poisonous snakes.
Currently, antivenom is made by injecting small doses of snake venom into animals, such as horses. Once the immune system fights the venom and produces the antibodies, scientists harvest them to be used as antivenom. However, venom and antivenom have to be closely matched. For example, antivenom made from snakes in India may not be as effective against the same species in Thailand.

While the antivenom cocktail prepared using MrFriede's blood has not been tested in humans yet, experts predict that the human origin of the antibodies would mean fewer side effects than antivenoms made the traditional way.
""Tim's antibodies are really quite extraordinary - he taught his immune system to get this very, very broad recognition,"" said Prof Kwong.
Notably, Mr Friede gave up on injecting himself with snake venom in 2018 after some close calls. He is now employed by Glanville's biotechnology company Centivax and contributing to the research.
As per the World Health Organization (WHO), every year, venomous snake bites kill tens of thousands of people globally and permanently disable several hundred thousand more.

https://www.ndtv.com/science/worlds-largest-solar-telescope-captures-stunning-details-of-suns-surface-8310925,World's Largest Solar Telescope Captures Stunning Details Of Sun's Surface,"Sun, 04 May 2025 08:24:32 +0530","The world's biggest solar telescope has captured the stunning details of the Sun's surface, showing sunspots and intense magnetic activity. The newly released image comes as the Sun moves towards its most active phase of its 11-year solar cycle.
The image was released by Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope in Hawaii.
It is the first image captured with the US National Science Foundation's new Visible Tunable Filter (VTF). The high-resolution photograph, taken in early December, shows a collection of enormous sunspots only 10 kilometres apart in size but spanning thousands of miles. The image showed sunspots, each about the size of a continent on Earth.
Scientists from the International Solar Cycle Prediction Panel, NASA, and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration announced in October that the sun reached the solar maximum or peak of activity. The sun's magnetic poles reverse during the peak, causing more sunspots to show up on its surface.
These sunspots are cooler, active areas on the Sun that can cause big solar explosions like solar flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs). When these solar outbursts take place, they shoot out charged particles into space, and if these particles reach Earth, they can disrupt satellites, cause power outages or affect GPS and phone signals.
Friedrich Woeger, the instrument program scientist at the NSF Inouye Solar Telescope, said, ""A solar storm in the 1800s (the Carrington Event) reportedly was so energetic that it caused fires in telegraph stations. We need to understand the physical drivers of these phenomena and how they can affect our technology and ultimately our lives.""
Mark Miesch, a research scientist at the Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences at the University of Colorado Boulder, said that sunspots were like magnetic plugs blocking some of the heat coming up to the surface. That's the reason they look darker and are cooler than the rest of the Sun's surface, he added.
He compared these sunspots to an oven. ""Even though these sunspots are cooler, they are still hotter than any oven on Earth,"" he added.

Scientists Uncover Potential Weight Loss Solution,"Sat, 03 May 2025 23:04:51 +0530","Scientists have made a groundbreaking discovery that could potentially replace weight loss drugs like Ozempic with a natural alternative. Researchers at Jiangnan University in China have identified a gut microbe, Bacteroides vulgatus, and its metabolites that can naturally regulate blood sugar levels and sugar cravings.
The study, published inNature Microbiology,found that increasing the abundance of this microbe in diabetic mice can stimulate the secretion of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), a hormone that helps regulate blood sugar levels and feelings of fullness.
GLP-1 is a natural hormone produced by the body, and its impaired function is often seen in people with type 2 diabetes. Drugs like Ozempic mimic this natural process, but researchers are now exploring ways to get the body to produce more GLP-1 on its own. The new research suggests that gut microbes like B. vulgatus and their metabolites may play a key role in shaping a person's sweet tooth.
The study found that mice lacking a gut protein called Ffar4 had reduced gut colonies of B. vulgatus, leading to decreased release of a hormone called FGF21, which is tied to sugar cravings. In humans, genetic variants of FGF21 were linked to an increased preference for sweet foods. The research team also found that treating mice with a metabolite of B. vulgatus boosted GLP-1 secretion, which then triggered the secretion of FGF21.
This breakthrough discovery could lead to new ways to manage weight and blood sugar levels naturally, potentially reducing the need for drugs like Ozempic. Further research is needed to explore the potential of this natural alternative.

This innovative method leverages electric field fluctuations to predict and potentially protect critical infrastructure from lightning strikes. With approximately 6,000 lightning bolts striking the ground worldwide every minute, this technology holds promise for revolutionising lightning protection and mitigating damage to cities and infrastructure globally.
Watch the video here:
According toNTT,the technology uses lightning-resistant UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles), such as drones, flying near thunderclouds at high altitudes to attract and guide lightning strikes safely to the ground via conductors, thereby protecting people and equipment from damage. Additionally, the lightning energy is harnessed and stored using compressed air and other charging methods.
NTT's goal is to reduce damage caused by lightning strikes worldwide, with the ultimate aim of absorbing thundercloud energy and eliminating lightning strikes that reach the ground. The company has begun developing the technology to attract lightning strikes with high accuracy and safety, focusing on improving UAV resistance to lightning currents and strong electromagnetic fields. This will enable stable flight even under lightning clouds. Furthermore, NTT aims to convert and store lightning energy into kinetic and magnetic energy, establishing a lightning charging technology.
This technology has the potential to benefit infrastructure companies, including telecommunications and electric power providers, as well as government agencies and local governments, by protecting their facilities from lightning strikes.

https://www.ndtv.com/science/the-dark-side-of-green-tech-can-we-keep-up-with-climate-goals-8321182,"""Green Tech Alone Won't Save Us"": Experts Warn Of Insufficient Progress Amid Climate Crisis","Sat, 03 May 2025 18:38:35 +0530","Despite the rapid acceleration of green technology innovation, experts warn that it may not be enough to save the planet from ecological scarcity and environmental disaster. As countries strive for carbon neutrality and net-zero emissions, the question remains whether these efforts will be sufficient to restore planetary stability and promote sustainable prosperity.
According to a report published in the sciencejournal Naturetitled""Why the green-technology race might not save the planet,""it highlights concerns that the global race for green technology may not suffice to ensure environmental sustainability. Despite advancements in renewable energy and eco-friendly innovations, the article emphasizes that without addressing overconsumption and implementing systemic changes, these technologies alone may not prevent ecological degradation.
The researchers behind the report argue that while green tech can boost economic prosperity, it must be complemented by global cooperation and policies that prioritize environmental health to truly safeguard the planet's future.
Authors writethat because nature is being underpriced, most economies disregard the increasing costs of ecological scarcity. They don't view natural systems as assets worth conserving, restoring, and protecting through investment. For example, global spending on biodiversity and habitat conservation, protection, and restoration ranges from $124 billion to $143 billion a year. Yet this is only up to one-fifth of what's needed - translating into a biodiversity-financing gap of more than half a trillion dollars.
The pursuit of ""green growth""-the idea that economies can continue to expand while reducing environmental harm-faces challenges such as rebound effects, where efficiency gains lead to increased consumption, and the environmental costs associated with producing green technologies themselves.
Therefore, a holistic approach that combines technological innovation with lifestyle changes and robust environmental policies is essential for achieving long-term planetary health.

Study Finds Wealthier People Slightly More Prosocial,"Sat, 03 May 2025 19:14:41 +0530","A comprehensive global study published inPNAS Nexusreveals that individuals with higher income and greater financial well-being are modestly more likely to engage in prosocial behaviors-such as donating, volunteering, and helping others-than those from lower socioeconomic backgrounds.
Conducted by researchers from the University of Birmingham, the studyanalyzed data from over 80,000 participants across 76 countries, highlighting a consistent positive association between wealth and altruistic actions. Interestingly, the study also found that individuals who have experienced financial hardship exhibit stronger links between improved financial status and prosocial behaviors, suggesting that personal experiences of precarity may enhance generosity.
Patricia Lockwood, Professor of Decision Neuroscience at the University of Birmingham and senior author ofthe study said:""There has been disagreement as to whether higher wealth makes you more or less prosocial. Our study clearly shows that wealth, and a subjective sense of financial well-being, are very strongly associated with prosocial behaviours and attitudes. Wealthier people are more inclined to give money to charity, and also to volunteer or do reciprocal acts of generosity. What's more, this effect is highly consistent globally even in countries that differ a lot in levels of wealth.
""However, we do also see a negative association between wealth and trust. People with higher income were less likely to trust others to act positively towards them. Finally, higher wealth was linked with punishing those who behave badly. This can be an important part of maintaining levels prosocial or good behaviour in society.""
The studyfound that previous experience of financial hardship leads to the strongest association between wealth and prosocial behaviour. Lead author Paul Vanags explained: ""When people have experienced precarity, higher financial well-being is then more likely to result in prosocial behaviours such as helping a stranger, donating and volunteering. So, when people have experienced hardship but have improved their personal circumstances to the point where they now feel well off, this is associated with higher levels of beneficial prosocial behaviours.""

Scientists Uncover Potential Weight Loss Solution,"Sat, 03 May 2025 23:04:51 +0530","Scientists have made a groundbreaking discovery that could potentially replace weight loss drugs like Ozempic with a natural alternative. Researchers at Jiangnan University in China have identified a gut microbe, Bacteroides vulgatus, and its metabolites that can naturally regulate blood sugar levels and sugar cravings.
The study, published inNature Microbiology,found that increasing the abundance of this microbe in diabetic mice can stimulate the secretion of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), a hormone that helps regulate blood sugar levels and feelings of fullness.
GLP-1 is a natural hormone produced by the body, and its impaired function is often seen in people with type 2 diabetes. Drugs like Ozempic mimic this natural process, but researchers are now exploring ways to get the body to produce more GLP-1 on its own. The new research suggests that gut microbes like B. vulgatus and their metabolites may play a key role in shaping a person's sweet tooth.
The study found that mice lacking a gut protein called Ffar4 had reduced gut colonies of B. vulgatus, leading to decreased release of a hormone called FGF21, which is tied to sugar cravings. In humans, genetic variants of FGF21 were linked to an increased preference for sweet foods. The research team also found that treating mice with a metabolite of B. vulgatus boosted GLP-1 secretion, which then triggered the secretion of FGF21.
This breakthrough discovery could lead to new ways to manage weight and blood sugar levels naturally, potentially reducing the need for drugs like Ozempic. Further research is needed to explore the potential of this natural alternative.

https://www.ndtv.com/science/watch-japans-drone-technology-turns-lightning-into-a-controlled-force-8322925,Watch: Japan's Drone Technology Turns Lightning Into A Controlled Force,"Sat, 03 May 2025 22:40:28 +0530","Japan's Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation (NTT) has pioneered a groundbreaking technology that claims to successfully trigger and draw lightning using a drone equipped with a lightning protection cage. This innovative method leverages electric field fluctuations to predict and potentially protect critical infrastructure from lightning strikes. With approximately 6,000 lightning bolts striking the ground worldwide every minute, this technology holds promise for revolutionising lightning protection and mitigating damage to cities and infrastructure globally.
Watch the video here:
According toNTT,the technology uses lightning-resistant UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles), such as drones, flying near thunderclouds at high altitudes to attract and guide lightning strikes safely to the ground via conductors, thereby protecting people and equipment from damage. Additionally, the lightning energy is harnessed and stored using compressed air and other charging methods.
NTT's goal is to reduce damage caused by lightning strikes worldwide, with the ultimate aim of absorbing thundercloud energy and eliminating lightning strikes that reach the ground. The company has begun developing the technology to attract lightning strikes with high accuracy and safety, focusing on improving UAV resistance to lightning currents and strong electromagnetic fields. This will enable stable flight even under lightning clouds. Furthermore, NTT aims to convert and store lightning energy into kinetic and magnetic energy, establishing a lightning charging technology.
This technology has the potential to benefit infrastructure companies, including telecommunications and electric power providers, as well as government agencies and local governments, by protecting their facilities from lightning strikes.

As countries strive for carbon neutrality and net-zero emissions, the question remains whether these efforts will be sufficient to restore planetary stability and promote sustainable prosperity.
According to a report published in the sciencejournal Naturetitled""Why the green-technology race might not save the planet,""it highlights concerns that the global race for green technology may not suffice to ensure environmental sustainability. Despite advancements in renewable energy and eco-friendly innovations, the article emphasizes that without addressing overconsumption and implementing systemic changes, these technologies alone may not prevent ecological degradation.
The researchers behind the report argue that while green tech can boost economic prosperity, it must be complemented by global cooperation and policies that prioritize environmental health to truly safeguard the planet's future.
Authors writethat because nature is being underpriced, most economies disregard the increasing costs of ecological scarcity. They don't view natural systems as assets worth conserving, restoring, and protecting through investment. For example, global spending on biodiversity and habitat conservation, protection, and restoration ranges from $124 billion to $143 billion a year. Yet this is only up to one-fifth of what's needed - translating into a biodiversity-financing gap of more than half a trillion dollars.
The pursuit of ""green growth""-the idea that economies can continue to expand while reducing environmental harm-faces challenges such as rebound effects, where efficiency gains lead to increased consumption, and the environmental costs associated with producing green technologies themselves.
Therefore, a holistic approach that combines technological innovation with lifestyle changes and robust environmental policies is essential for achieving long-term planetary health.

Study Finds Wealthier People Slightly More Prosocial,"Sat, 03 May 2025 19:14:41 +0530","A comprehensive global study published inPNAS Nexusreveals that individuals with higher income and greater financial well-being are modestly more likely to engage in prosocial behaviors-such as donating, volunteering, and helping others-than those from lower socioeconomic backgrounds.
Conducted by researchers from the University of Birmingham, the studyanalyzed data from over 80,000 participants across 76 countries, highlighting a consistent positive association between wealth and altruistic actions. Interestingly, the study also found that individuals who have experienced financial hardship exhibit stronger links between improved financial status and prosocial behaviors, suggesting that personal experiences of precarity may enhance generosity.
Patricia Lockwood, Professor of Decision Neuroscience at the University of Birmingham and senior author ofthe study said:""There has been disagreement as to whether higher wealth makes you more or less prosocial. Our study clearly shows that wealth, and a subjective sense of financial well-being, are very strongly associated with prosocial behaviours and attitudes. Wealthier people are more inclined to give money to charity, and also to volunteer or do reciprocal acts of generosity. What's more, this effect is highly consistent globally even in countries that differ a lot in levels of wealth.
""However, we do also see a negative association between wealth and trust. People with higher income were less likely to trust others to act positively towards them. Finally, higher wealth was linked with punishing those who behave badly. This can be an important part of maintaining levels prosocial or good behaviour in society.""
The studyfound that previous experience of financial hardship leads to the strongest association between wealth and prosocial behaviour. Lead author Paul Vanags explained: ""When people have experienced precarity, higher financial well-being is then more likely to result in prosocial behaviours such as helping a stranger, donating and volunteering. So, when people have experienced hardship but have improved their personal circumstances to the point where they now feel well off, this is associated with higher levels of beneficial prosocial behaviours.""

Aspergillus, a type of fungus that thrives in warm, damp climates, has the potential to infect millions if it makes its way into the aforementioned regions.
Norman van Rhijn, the study co-author, has warned that the world was approaching a ""tipping point"" where the spread of fungal pathogens could become the norm.
""We're talking about hundreds of thousands of lives, and continental shifts in species distributions. In 50 years, where things grow and what you get infected by is going to be completely different,"" Mr Van Rhijn told theFinancial Times.
As per the study, the species can grow quickly in high temperatures in compost, which explains why it is able to thrive in the 37C internal temperature of the human body. Additionally, fungi's resilience means they can survive and thrive in places that other organisms can't, even inside Chernobyl's nuclear reactors.
While inhaling the fungus's spores does not make everyone ill, those with conditions such as asthma, cystic fibrosis or a weakened immune system remain at risk.

What makes the situation worrisome is the fact that the fungal kingdom is largely unexplored by scientists. Less than 10 per cent of an estimated 1.5 to 3.8 million fungi species have been described, and only a tiny fraction have had their genetic material (genome) sequenced.
""Its lifestyle in the natural environment may have provided Aspergillus fumigatus with the fitness advantage needed to colonise human lungs,"" said Professor Elaine Bignell, co-director at the MRC Centre for Medical Mycology at Exeter University.
The study highlighted thatAspergillus fumigatuscould spread across an additional 77 per cent of territory by the year 2100 as a result of the world's heavy use of fossil fuels. As a result, potentially nine million people in Europe could be exposed to the infection.
While the danger is imminent, scientists say the development of antifungal medicines has been hobbled by the financial unattractiveness of investing in them, because of high costs and doubts over their profitability.

Where, When And How To See It","Mon, 05 May 2025 14:50:48 +0530","Stargazers are in for a treat as the Eta Aquariid meteor shower is set to illuminate the UK skies, peaking on May 6, 2025. Active since April 19, this annual spectacle will continue until May 28, offering a chance to spot ""shooting stars"" and potentially dazzling fireballs. According toNASA, the Eta Aquariids are created by debris from Halley's Comet, and Earth's passage through this trail results in the spectacular meteor display.
Under ideal conditions like dark skies and minimal moonlight, observers can see 10-30 meteors per hour in the Northern Hemisphere and up to 60 in the Southern Hemisphere. The meteors are fast, moving at about 66 km/s, and often leave glowing trails.
About the Meteor Shower
The Eta Aquariid meteors, which peak during early May each year, are notable for their incredible speed, entering Earth's atmosphere at approximately 40.7 miles (65.4 kilometres) per second. This rapid movement can create glowing ""trains"" of incandescent debris that linger for several seconds to minutes after the meteor has passed. During the Eta Aquariids' peak, observers can expect to see around 50 meteors per hour.
The meteor shower will peak the night of Monday (May 5) into the morning hours of Tuesday (May 6), according to NASA. The best time to watch the meteor shower is at 2 am local time on May 6.
""Look away from the Moon, and give your eyes about 30 minutes to adjust to the dark. Avoid looking at bright lights, such as your cell phone, too, as this will take your eyes off the sky and ruin your night vision"", said NASA.
The UK is set for a great view of the Eta Aquariid meteor shower on Sunday night into early Monday morning, with largely clear skies expected across much of the country. However, eastern England and Scotland may experience some patchy cloud, while Shetland and Orkney are likely to see increasing cloud cover, making viewing conditions more challenging,BBC Weatherreported.
Despite the clear skies, it will be a chilly morning, with temperatures ranging from 5 to 7°C in many areas and potentially near freezing in rural locations, accompanied by a fresh north-easterly wind. To make the most of this astronomical event, stargazers should dress warmly, find a dark spot with minimal light pollution, and look towards the eastern sky between midnight and dawn when meteor activity is highest.

Debate Rages Over Who Gets The Title,"Mon, 05 May 2025 11:01:42 +0530","The recent all-women spaceflight carried out on Jeff Bezos's Blue Origin vehicle has raised discussion ofwho gets to be calledan astronaut. Sean Duffy, Donald Trump's transportation secretary,disputed the astronaut titlegiven to those on the flight, including singer Katy Perry and journalist Gayle King.
The term astronaut was only rarely disputed until thefirst ""celebrity"" suborbital flight in 2021. In the 1960s, pilots flying the experimental, rocket-powered X-15 jet wereawarded astronaut statusby the US Air Force if they flew above 50 miles (80km).
Sir Richard Branson's 2021 flight aboard his Virgin Galactic vehicle reached 53 miles (85km) - an altitude recognised by some experts as being within outer space. Bezos followed a few days later,travelling on his Blue OriginNew Shepard vehicle. This flight reached about 68 miles (106km) in altitude.
Bezos has focused on reaching an altitude of about 62.1 miles (100km), one proposed boundary of space known as the Kármán line, named after the early 20th-century polymath Theodore von Kármán.
A 2021post on social mediaby Bezos's Blue Origin capitalised on the fact that his New Shepard vehicle reached the higher boundary. The suggestion from the post was that those who travelled to the lower boundary on rival Virgin Galactic flights could have their ""space traveller"" status questioned, whereas those who travelled with Blue Origin could not.
This particular post did not mention the question of who is an ""astronaut"". However, this is how Blue Origincurrently describesthose who travel on New Shepard.
Indeed, some definitions of ""astronaut"" simply state that it is a person who has been to space. Therefore, another implication of the post - intentional or not - might be that those who travel with Bezos's company are more eligible for such a designation than those who have been to lower altitudes.
While Blue Origin calls the Kármán line an ""internationally recognised boundary"" of space, it is far from universally accepted. Theodore von Kármán wanted to separate out aeronautics (the science of flying aircraft) and astronautics (the science of space travel).
As a byproduct, he calculated the maximum altitude that an aircraft could go without reaching orbital velocity (where it would start orbiting the Earth) to bearound 52 miles (84km).
A researcher and associate of von Kármán calledAndrew Haleywas interested in space law. He established von Kármán's calculation as the boundary of space. This was later raised to 62.1 miles (100km) by the world governing body for air sports, the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale.
The Kármán line has very little scientific rationale, however. If you ask a geologist, an atmospheric scientist and a space physics expert where the definition of space is, you will get vastly different answers.
For example, as somebody who specialises in magnetospheric physics and solar influence, I would say space properly startsat the plasmapause. This is a boundary around the Earth that's based on differences in the charged particles that exist on either side of the division. The plasmapause sits at an altitude of around 35,000 miles (57,000km).
The recent Blue Origin flight understandably made a strong positive impression on the passengers. Gayle King compared the flight to the historic launch in 1961 that made Nasa astronaut Alan Shepard the first American in space.
The effusive reactions from the passengers, along with King's and Blue Origin's use of the term ""astronaut"" to describe the team memberspromptedabacklashonline. King noted that men on similar flights hadn't been subjected to such criticism, and Katy Perry saysshe felt""battered and bruised"" by the reaction.
Among the criticswas the US transport secretary, Sean Duffy, who stated that the participants could not be astronauts as they failed to meet theFederal Aviation Administration (FAA) astronaut criteria. The FAA requirements for an astronaut are for them to be a member of crew, to contribute to spaceflight safety and to demonstrate activities essential to public safety. Their minimum altitude for ""space"" is the 50 mile (80km) limit.
As New Shepard isfully automated, none of the passengers could really be considered ""crew members"". Similarly, if you buy a ticket on a plane, you are not crew unless employed by the airline to do a job.
Would it be different if private space travellers were able to carry out scientific research during their journey? This might make them more than just passengers and potentially qualify them for the ""crew"" designation. Blue Origin and Virgin Galactic are actually not suited for any sort of weightlessness research. Passengers experience around 3-4 minutes of weightlessness.
By contrast, a flight on theAirbus A310 zero-Gplane gives 25-30 seconds of weightlessness. When this is repeated 25-30 times, you get between 10 and 15 minutes of weightlessness in total. This avenue for carrying out research in microgravity is also open to anybody with a sensible scientific idea to test rather than just members of the rich elite.
Does it matter what space travellers actually call themselves? The FAA designation of ""astronaut"" is not the only one. Some dictionary definitions simply define an astronaut as a persontrained to go into spaceor, as mentioned, a person who hasflown in space. The passengers on Blue Origin's New Shepard flights would probably qualify under both of these definitions.
But let's consider the legal dimension. Star Trek actorWilliam Shatner flew with Blue Originon a New Shepard vehicle in 2021. If Shatner had experienced a health-related incident during the flight, who would have been at fault?
If Shatner was an ""astronaut"", could it be argued that he held a greater level of responsibility for any adverse effects from the flight? If he was simply a passenger, might the company share more responsibility?
Thankfully, such a situation has not yet occurred, which means that any associated legal arguments remain hypothetical. But as more paying passengers travel on flights to space, the chances of adverse incidents increase.
Ultimately, everyone can have an opinion about whether just going into space - wherever the boundary may lie - makes you an astronaut. But there may be more to consider than a nice title.

Earlier this year, in February, JWST's observations led by Louis-Philippe Coulombe, a graduate student at Universite de Montreal's Trottier Institute for Research on Exoplanets (IREx), revealed key details about its atmosphere.
Observations by Coulombe, published inNature Astronomy, revealed that this rare exoplanet orbits its G-type star, LTT 9779, in less than a day (probably 19 hours), and it is tidally locked (just like Earth's Moon), which means that one side always faces its star while the other remains in darkness.
With temperatures reaching almost 2,000 degrees Celsius on its dayside, LTT 9779 is one of the few known planets in the ""hot Neptune desert"", where Neptunian planets aren't found that often.

As per a recentpress release, LTT-9779 b survives where only a few planets can. It maintains a carbon-rich atmosphere in a region where hot Neptune-class worlds are expected to evaporate, hence, scientists are stunned over its existence.
""This makes LTT-9779 b a valuable laboratory for studying atmospheric escape and chemical processes under extreme conditions, offering new insight into the survival of planets in the hot Neptune desert,"" the presser added.
As per the Coulombe team's discovery, the exoplanet's dayside hosts reflective clouds on its cooler western hemisphere as it manages to create a striking contrast to the hotter eastern side.
In another fascinating detail, the scientists discovered clouds made of materials like silicate minerals, which form on the slightly cooler western side of the planet's dayside.

The presser mentioned that these reflective clouds help explain why this planet is so bright at visible wavelengths, bouncing back much of the star's light.
In an update about the planet's composition, the study also detected water vapour in the atmosphere. ""By modeling LTT 9779 b's atmosphere in detail, we're starting to unlock the processes driving its alien weather patterns,"" said Coulombe's research advisor Bjorn Benneke, an UdeM professor of astronomy and co-author of the study.
Officially named Cuancoa, LTT 9779 b is an ultra-hot Neptune, with a mass about 29 times that of Earth. ""Finding a planet of this size so close to its host star is like finding a snowball that hasn't melted in a fire,"" said Coulombe in a press release. ""It's a testament to the diversity of planetary systems and offers a window into how planets evolve under extreme conditions.""
The scientists said that this rare planetary system continues to challenge scientists' understanding of how planets form, migrate, and endure in the face of unrelenting stellar forces.

The photo taken by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) for the first time shows the full extent of the nebula's lobes, shown in blue colour. These lobes are closed, bubble-like structures that each extend about three light-years. They look like giant 'legs' of the spider, with the European Space Agency (ESA) calling it ""cosmic creepy-crawly"".
The Red Spider Nebula is a breathtaking planetary nebula approximately 3,000 light-years away from Earth. This stunning celestial object is the result of a star's final evolutionary stage, where it sheds its outer layers, creating a shell of gas and dust.
NASA stated that these lobes are traced by light emitted from H2 molecules, which contain two hydrogen atoms bonded together. These huge bubbles have been inflated by the outflowing gas from the centre of the nebula over thousands of years.

As a star like our Sun exhausts its fuel, it expands into a red giant, expelling its outer layers into space. The exposed core, now a white dwarf, emits intense ultraviolet radiation, causing the ejected material to glow, creating the vibrant colours of the planetary nebula.
""Planetary nebulae like this one are made when a Sun-like star reaches the end of its life. After ballooning into a red giant, the star then throws off its outer layers into space, revealing its white-hot core. Ultraviolet light from the central star causes the cast-off material to glow,"" NASA said.
The US-based space agency revealed that the image was captured by NIRCam, James Webb's primary near-infrared imager, which aims to provide high-resolution imaging and spectroscopy for a wide variety of investigations.

""Though we can only see one star - the central star - here, it's possible that there is a companion star, too. Its presence could explain the nebula's shape: the characteristic narrow waist and wide outflows,"" NASA said. The gravitational influence of this unseen partner sculpts the ejected material, creating the nebula's characteristic bipolar form.
The Red Spider Nebula offers a glimpse into the future of our own Sun, which is expected to undergo a similar transformation in about 5 billion years. As the Sun exhausts its fuel, it will expand into a red giant, shedding its outer layers and creating a planetary nebula, leaving behind a white dwarf remnant
As per NASA, this hourglass shape, as seen in the Red Spider Nebula, is also observed in other planetary nebulae such as the Butterfly Nebula, also captured by Webb recently.

Dark matter has been one of astronomy's biggest mysteries for nearly a century. The idea first emerged in the 1930s, when Swiss astronomer Fritz Zwicky realised that galaxies in the distant Coma Cluster were moving far too fast to be held together by the gravity of their visible stars. Decades later, Vera Rubin's studies of spiral galaxies showed that the outer regions rotated just as quickly as their centres - something that only made sense if an unseen mass was providing extra gravitational glue.
Read What A Recent Study Said About Existence Of Dark Matter
To this day, dark matter has never been observed directly. It doesn't emit, absorb or reflect light. In that sense, it behaves a bit like the One Ring inThe Lord of the Rings- powerful, omnipresent, but essentially invisible. Yet scientists believe it makes up about 85 per cent of all matter in the universe, outweighing everything we can see - stars, planets, even our own bodies - according tospace.com.
But a new study led by Prof Tomonori Totani of the University of Tokyo hints that we may finally have caught dark matter in the act.
Totani's team analysed Fermi telescope observations of the Milky Way's centre - the region where dark matter is expected to be densest. They detected a halo-shaped glow of gamma rays at energies of around 20 gigaelectronvolts, an unusually strong signal that neatly matches predictions for a type of hypothetical dark matter particle known as a WIMP (weakly interacting massive particle). In theory, when two WIMPs collide, they annihilate each other, releasing gamma rays - the universe's most energetic form of light.
""The emission closely matches the shape expected from a dark matter halo,"" Totani is quoted as saying byspace.com. He added that no known astronomical phenomena provide an easy alternative explanation.
If the results hold up under scrutiny, this would be the first time humanity has ""seen"" dark matter - not directly with our eyes, but through the energetic fingerprints it leaves behind. It would also point to a brand-new particle outside the Standard Model of physics, placing scientists on the brink of a discovery as transformative as the Higgs boson.
But like every good plot twist - thinkInterstellarorArrival- the scientific community is cautious. More data, and more verification, are needed. For now, dark matter remains partly hidden, but perhaps no longer completely in the dark.

In the latest update, the northern lights could be visible across parts of the United States on November 26,Space.comreported. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) Space Weather Prediction Center noted that a high-speed solar wind stream from a coronal hole has boosted geomagnetic activity.
The aurora australis is caused by charged particles from the solar wind interacting with the Earth's magnetic field and atmosphere. These particles, mainly electrons and protons, precipitate into the upper atmosphere, exciting atoms of oxygen and nitrogen, which emit light as they return to their ground state.
The colours of the aurora depend on the energy of the particles and the altitude at which they collide with the atmosphere.

Even common ""blue"" foods such as blueberries or blue corn are actually shades of purple or indigo. But a rare rainforest tree proves otherwise. The Elaeocarpus angustifolius, known as the blue quandong, blue fig, or blue marble tree, grows in Australia, Papua New Guinea, and parts of Indonesia, and produces the only known fruit with a genuine, vivid blue appearance.
The fruit looks so bright and metallic that many assume its colour is digitally edited. But researchers confirm that the blue marble fruit's intense hue is natural and does not come from pigments. Instead, it results from structural colouration, a light-bending optical effect similar to the colours seen in peacock feathers or butterfly wings.
Studies published inNatureandPNASreveal that the fruit's skin contains ultra-thin layers of cellulose arranged in nanoscale patterns. These layers reflect only blue wavelengths of light while cancelling out all others. Interestingly, when scientists attempted to extract blue pigment from the fruit, the material turned grey, proving the colour isn't chemical.
This structural blue makes the fruit one of only six known in the world to use this phenomenon. Researchers believe the tree evolved this feature to attract birds, which see blue and UV light very clearly. The glossy blue fruit stands out even under dense rainforest shade, helping birds locate it from long distances and spread its seeds widely. The blue quandong remains an evolutionary mystery and a rare example of how nature uses physics, not pigments, to create extraordinary colours.

Experts say this eclipse will bring the longest period of total darkness seen this century, lasting up to 6 minutes and 23 seconds on the centreline.
The eclipse will begin over the Atlantic Ocean before reaching land near the Strait of Gibraltar. From there, the path of totality will cross southern Spain, Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Libya and Egypt before moving into regions of the Middle East. Because it passes through many populated areas with good travel routes, a large number of visitors are expected to gather along the track. Countries in the Americas, including Brazil, will not see any part of the event.
People inside the narrowband of totality will experience daylight fading into deep twilight as the Moon completely covers the Sun. Those outside this zone will see only a partial eclipse, which reduces sunlight but does not reveal the Sun's corona.
The event will follow a predictable sequence. Around 60 to 80 minutes before totality, the Moon will begin to cover the Sun. Total darkness will last from a few seconds to more than six minutes, depending on location. The Sun will then slowly reappear during another hour-long partial phase. Local astronomy agencies will release exact timing details closer to the date.
During totality, observers may notice temperature drops, shifting winds and changes in animal behaviour. The sky may darken enough for Venus, Mercury and other bright objects to appear. Features such as the ""diamond ring"" effect and the Sun's pale corona are also expected to be visible.
Total solar eclipses occur somewhere on Earth roughly every 18 months, but very few last as long or pass through as many accessible regions as this one, making it a significant global event for scientists and skywatchers.

https://www.ndtv.com/science/generative-ai-produces-only-average-level-creative-work-study-9697979,Generative AI Produces Only Average-Level Creative Work: Study,"Tue, 25 Nov 2025 17:59:34 +0530","A new theoretical study published in theJournal of Creative Behaviourhas challenged the belief that artificial intelligence is close to surpassing human creativity. The research, conducted by Professor David H Cropley from the University of South Australia, argues that generative AI models such as ChatGPT are mathematically limited to amateur-level creativity.
Professor Cropley began the study to bring clarity to the ongoing debate about whether AI can truly be creative. He applied the standard definition of creativity, which requires both originality and effectiveness, to the way large language models operate. According to him, this approach helps determine whether the design of AI systems places a natural cap on their creative abilities.
According tothe study,large language models work by predicting the next word or ""token"" based on patterns learned from their training data. Cropley explains that this predictable and statistical method allows for a mathematical evaluation of AI creativity. His analysis shows that while AI can produce outputs that seem creative, its originality is limited by the patterns it has learned, and therefore its creativity cannot rise beyond average human levels.
The study cites previous tests showing that AI-generated stories and ideas usually rank around the 40th to 50th percentile when compared with human work. This supports the conclusion that AI cannot reach expert or professional standards under current design methods.
Cropley notes that most people produce average levels of creativity, which is why AI output can appear impressive to the general public. However, professionals in writing, design, or art quickly notice that AI-generated content is repetitive and formulaic.
According to thestudy,truly high-level creativity involves producing ideas that are both unique and highly effective - something AI cannot achieve because it relies on existing data. Cropley says AI may assist with routine tasks, but it cannot replace skilled creators or produce groundbreaking work on its own.
The paper also acknowledges limitations. It uses simplified mathematical assumptions and focuses on standard AI settings. It does not measure how human editing or advanced prompting may improve final results. Future studies may explore whether adjusting AI parameters or using different architectures could expand its creative potential.
Cropley concludes that achieving expert-level creativity in AI would require a completely new kind of system - one that can generate ideas beyond learned statistical patterns. Until then, human creativity remains unmatched.

According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), over 90% of the 112 lemur species face extinction. While habitat loss, illegal logging, and hunting remain major threats, a new danger has emerged - lemurs are increasingly being hunted and consumed as meat by wealthy city residents.
This alarming trend was uncovered in a four-year study (2022-2025) into Madagascar's hidden lemur meat trade. The research, published inConservation Letters, involved interviews with 2,600 people across 17 cities, including hunters, suppliers, buyers, and restaurant staff.
Findings revealed that nearly 13,000 lemurs are killed and eaten annually. In over one-third of the cities surveyed, lemur meat is regularly consumed. About 94.5% of this trade occurs in secret between suppliers and trusted customers, while 5.5% of the sales take place in restaurants. The meat is often seen as a delicacy, with consumers believing it has a unique taste and even health benefits such as promoting youthfulness.
Brown lemurs and ruffed lemurs are the most hunted species. Restaurants offering wild meat are significantly more expensive, catering to affluent customers.
Researchers stress that traditional conservation methods won't be enough to stop this crisis. They stress that dealing with this crisis requires more than standard conservation efforts. ""Without a comprehensive data-driven approach, the world's most endangered mammals may soon be eaten into extinction.""
They recommend stricter enforcement of firearm laws, awareness campaigns on health risks, and providing hunters with alternative sources of income to reduce dependency on wildlife hunting.

https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/perfect-forensic-tool-how-scientists-use-bed-bugs-to-bust-crime-9694479,'Perfect Forensic Tool': How Scientists Use Bed Bugs To Bust Crime,"Tue, 25 Nov 2025 15:09:56 +0530","Under glaring laboratory lights, a research assistant extends his forearm and carefully inverts a mesh-topped container onto his skin to allow a wriggling mass of bed bugs to feed on his blood, all in the name of science.
Long-loathed as itchy household pests, the blood-sucking insects have revealed a darker, more intriguing potential as Malaysian scientists have discovered they can be turned into unlikely crime-busting allies.
A team from the Science University of Malaysia (USM) in northern Penang has found that tropical bed bugs can retain DNA from human prey for up to 45 days after snacking on an unwary victim.
This makes the tiny critters, who love to lurk in headboard cracks, mattress seams and pillow covers, ideal evidence resources when it comes to pinpointing suspects at crime scenes.
From a speck of blood, police investigators may one day be able to piece together the full profile of an offender, if the critters are present at a crime scene.
Analysing the insects could reveal gender, eye colour, hair and skin colour, entomologist Abdul Hafiz Ab Majid told AFP.
""We call bed bugs the 'musuh dalam selimut' (Malay for ""the enemy in the blanket""),"" Hafiz said, adding that ""they can also be spies"" to help solve crimes.
In a laboratory tucked deep inside USM's School of Biological Sciences, Hafiz and postdoctoral researcher Lim Li have spent nearly half a decade studying tropical bed bugs.
The bloodsuckers, scientific name Cimex hemipterus, are the most common species found in Malaysia and the tropics.
The bugs are reared in containers under a laboratory bench, each wrapped in black plastic to mimic conditions the insects thrive in.
""We place folded pieces of paper inside the small containers so the bed bugs have something to climb on,"" Hafiz said.
With the lab's temperature kept at a constant 23C to 24C, the insects suck up 1.5 to 5.3 microlitres of blood at each feeding, an ""amount less than a droplet"", Hafiz explained.
Researchers found DNA extracted from bed bugs that had fed on human blood could recover basic ""phenotypic profiling"", a person's observable traits, as well as gender for up to 45 days.
Using so-called STR (Short Tandem Repeat) and SNP (Single Nucleotide Polymorphism) markers, specific DNA sequences extracted from the blood, researchers can determine the gender, eye, hair and skin colour of potential suspects, long after they have fled the scene.
The USM study called ""Human profiling from STR and SNP analysis of tropical bed bug, Cimex hemipterus"", was published in Nature's Scientific Reports two years ago.
It was the first documented forensic use involving tropical bed bugs.
Unlike mosquitoes and flies, bed bugs cannot fly, and once they have fed, ""become engorged and can't move around that much"", Hafiz said, adding that they can only move within 20 feet (six metres) of where they've fed.
""That's what makes them unique. We can say they are perfect to use as a forensic tool compared to mosquitoes that... fly away,"" Hafiz added.
The bugs are particularly useful at crime scenes, where fluids have been wiped away to destroy evidence, as the critters are often well-hidden.
Back in the lab, researcher Lim did not hesitate to demonstrate a feeding session, even joking that she had been a ""willing victim"" for science.
""I let them feed on my blood when I wanted to test how long (it would take) the human DNA to degrade,"" she said.
Lim insisted that the inconspicuous bugs are ""misunderstood creatures"" and do not spread diseases -- even though their bite leaves an itchy rash that can last for weeks.
""Maybe we can try educating people because the bed bugs are not actually vectors. So even if you get bitten, they can't transmit diseases to you,"" she said.
While the researchers imagined a future where tiny bed bugs at crime scenes could lead investigators to murder suspects, Hafiz said the insects weren't a magic fix.
Bed bugs have their limits -- especially when it comes to cracking cold cases, said Hafiz.
""It only gives investigators a time frame of 45 days to use bed bugs as evidence -- and only if they are available at the crime scene,"" he said.

Even though it's huge, scientists say it's smaller than in many previous years, making it the fifth smallest ozone hole since 1992. NASA and NOAA scientists report that the ozone layer is gradually healing because of the Montreal Protocol, an international agreement that banned chemicals that destroy ozone.
Scientists believe that if the trend continues, the ozone layer is expected to recover later this century fully.
The ozone hole over Antarctica is slowly recovering, according to@nasa&@noaa's long-term record.This year's ozone hole was the 5th-smallest on record, reaching an annual maximum extent of 8.83 million square miles on Sept. 9, 2025.https://t.co/becxmD6aKlpic.twitter.com/4glMTeXlng
Paul Newman, a senior scientist with the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, and leader of the ozone research team at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland,said, ""As predicted, we're seeing ozone holes trending smaller in area than they were in the early 2000s.""
""They're forming later in the season and breaking up earlier. But we still have a long way to go before it recovers to 1980s levels,"" he added.
This year, during the depletion season between September 7 and October 13, the average size of the hole was 7.23 million square miles. It is the season when the ozone hole is the largest and it starts shrinking after the depletion season.
In 2025, it is breaking up nearly three weeks earlier than usual compared to the past 10 years.
Stephen Montzka, a senior scientist with NOAA's Global Monitoring Laboratory, said, ""Since peaking around the year 2000, levels of ozone-depleting substances in the Antarctic stratosphere have declined by about a third, relative to pre-ozone-hole levels.""
The ozone layer, located between 7 and 31 miles above the Earth's surface, protects life on the planet by filtering dangerous UV rays.Ozone depletion occurs when human-made compounds containing chlorine and bromine, once widely used in aerosol sprays, foams, air conditioners, and refrigerators, rise into the stratosphere.
""This year's hole would have been more than one million square miles larger if there was still as much chlorine in the stratosphere as there was 25 years ago,"" said Newman.

https://www.ndtv.com/science/thirty-metre-telescope-india-japan-team-up-to-search-for-extraterrestrial-life-with-giant-telescope-9695319,"Do Aliens Exist? India, Japan Team Up To Answer Question With Giant Telescope","Tue, 25 Nov 2025 11:12:33 +0530","In a landmark collaboration, India and Japan are joining forces to build one of the world's most ambitious astronomical instruments - the Thirty Metre Telescope (TMT). This cutting-edge optical-infrared telescope, with a massive 30-metre primary mirror, promises to revolutionise our understanding of the universe and could even answer humanity's most profound question: Are we alone?
The TMT project is an international partnership involving India, Japan, and two leading US universities. Its primary goal is to peer deeper into the cosmos than ever before, studying black holes, distant galaxies, and, most intriguingly, searching for signs of life beyond Earth.
""Astronomers want to have a bigger mirror to collect more light from the distant universe,"" explained Dr. Saku Tsuneta, Vice Chair of the Committee on National Space Policy at Japan's Cabinet Office, Tokyo. ""The bigger the mirror, the more discoveries you can make about very distant objects.""
The TMT's 30-metre mirror will dwarf existing telescopes, enabling unprecedented clarity and depth in observations. Unlike traditional telescopes with a single large mirror, TMT will use 500 precisely aligned smaller mirrors to form its giant primary mirror. This complex engineering feat requires cutting-edge technology-and that's where India plays a pivotal role.
""Instead of one large mirror, we have 500 smaller mirrors consisting of one 30-metre primary mirror,"" said Dr. Tsuneta. ""The location and angle of each mirror has to be carefully adjusted. That has been done by Indian technology.""
India's contribution lies in developing opto-mechanical systems that ensure these mirrors remain perfectly aligned, a critical requirement for the telescope's success. This collaboration underscores India's growing stature in global science and technology partnerships.
India is a founder-member partner in this project, which aims to open new windows to the universe through optical and infrared astronomy. Indian participation in this project was approved by the Union Cabinet in 2014. India's participation in the TMT collaboration involves three institutes: the Indian Institute of Astrophysics (IIA), Bengaluru, the Inter-University Center for Astronomy and Astrophysics (IUCAA), Pune, and the Aryabhatta Research Institute for Observational Sciences (ARIES), Nainital.
The chosen site for TMT is Mauna Kea in Hawaii, at an altitude of 4,000 metres – a location renowned for its clear skies and minimal atmospheric interference. Japan already operates an 8.2-metre telescope there, which has been delivering ground breaking observations for over 25 years.
""Our primary site for construction is Mauna Kea in Hawaii,"" Dr. Tsuneta confirmed. ""This is one of the best sites for astronomical observation.""
However, the project faces challenges. Mauna Kea is considered sacred by Native Hawaiian communities, leading to protests against construction. Negotiations are ongoing to address cultural concerns and seek consent.
""We don't want to build a telescope without their permission,"" Dr. Tsuneta emphasised. ""It's an ongoing process.""
Interestingly, alternative sites have been discussed, including Hanle in Ladakh, India, which already hosts a high-altitude observatory. While no decision has been made, the possibility reflects India's growing role in global astronomy.
The telescope's scientific agenda is vast. It will study black holes, map distant galaxies, and probe the early universe. But its most exciting mission is the search for extraterrestrial life.
""One of the important purposes is to find life on another planet other than Earth,"" said Dr. Tsuneta. ""Astronomers believe there are other life forms elsewhere, distant from Earth. This telescope will find the signature of life forms in planetary systems belonging to other stars – not our Sun.""
This means TMT will analyse exoplanets – planets orbiting stars outside our solar system – for chemical signatures that indicate life, such as water vapour or organic molecules.
The TMT is expected to be operational by the mid-2030s. Technological development is progressing well, thanks to contributions from partner nations, particularly India's precision engineering.
""Technologically, thanks to the Indian contribution, progress is in good shape,"" Dr. Tsuneta noted.
The implications of TMT's discoveries could be monumental. Detecting life beyond Earth would be one of the greatest scientific breakthroughs of all time, potentially earning global recognition.
""If you find it, you will get a Nobel Prize,"" quipped Pallava Bagla during the conversation.
""I'm too old,"" laughed Dr. Tsuneta. ""Younger people should get a Nobel Prize, not me. Obviously, the team should get it.""
India-Japan: Partners in Space and BeyondThis collaboration builds on a strong history of India-Japan cooperation in space science.
The two nations are already working together on LUPEX, a lunar exploration mission to search for water on the Moon. Now, with TMT, they aim to look for life among the stars.
India and Japan are old and good friends; they are together looking for water on the Moon through LUPEX and life on other stars using the Thirty Metre Telescope.

https://www.ndtv.com/science/study-reveals-the-mystery-behind-giant-radio-relics-in-the-universe-9691786,Study Reveals The Mystery Behind Giant Radio Relics In The Universe,"Mon, 24 Nov 2025 22:09:14 +0530","At the largest scales of the universe, huge clusters of galaxies crash into one another in extremely slow but powerful collisions. These events leave behind giant, faint arcs, long ribbons of radio waves stretching across millions of light-years. These ghostly structures, called radio relics, are created when massive shock waves speed up electrons to nearly the speed of light, reportedSpace.com.
Astronomers have found many such relics, but their strange behaviour has been very hard to understand.
Scientists have discovered that the magnetic fields within radio relics are much stronger than expected. Measurements using radio and X-ray light reveal different strengths of the shock waves. Further complicating the puzzlement is that X-ray data suggests that these shocks are not strong enough to accelerate electrons, raising the question of how radio relics form.
A recent study by scientists at the Leibnitz Institute for Astrophysics Potsdam (AIP) in Germany offers a solution to these long-standing questions. The team used high-resolution simulations to understand how radio relics are form and how they change over time. Their model recreated the mysterious features seen in actual observations, further shedding light on the nature of these massive arc-like structures.
Joseph Whittingham, the lead author of the study and a postdoctoral researcher at AIP, explains that studying the problem at different scales was key to their success. In their paper, he and his team write that they used a large set of cosmological simulations that show how galaxy clusters evolve and collide over billions of years.
In this data, they focused on an extremely powerful collision between two clusters, one about 2.5 times more massive than the other. This collision generated massive, arched shock waves extending nearly 7 million light-years.
Based on these initial findings, the team further developed extremely high-resolution simulations called ""shock-tubes."" Through these, they were able to understand the precise physics of a single shock wave traveling through the uneven and turbulent outer regions of a galaxy cluster. From this, they developed models that show how electrons are accelerated at the shock front and how the radio waves emitted would appear in a telescope.
This multi-scale approach enables them to understand the microscopic physics that current large cosmological simulations don't fully capture.
The simulations revealed that as the shock wave moves outward from the cluster, it collides with shocks created by cold gas coming from the cosmic web. This collision transforms the plasma into a dense layer, which in turn collides with smaller clumps of gas. This creates a turbulent environment, strengthening the magnetic fields to the point where they reach values comparable to those recorded in actual observations.
Study co-author and AIP scientist Christoph Frommer explains that this entire process creates turbulence, which twists and compresses the magnetic fields, leading to the strengths astronomers have observed. This solves a previously major mystery.
The study also explains why radio and X-ray measurements differ. When the shock wave collides with dense gas clumps, some parts of the shock become more powerful and accelerate electrons more efficiently. These bright and dense parts are the primary contributors to radio signals.
However, X-ray instruments measure an average of the entire width of the shock, including the weaker parts. This explains the discrepancy between the two.
Simulations also show that the strongest and most confined parts of the shock wave produce almost all of the radio emission. Therefore, the low average shock strength measured by X-rays does not conflict with the mechanism of radio emission.
These multi-scale simulations together reproduced the same combination of magnetic, radio, and X-ray properties seen in real radio emission. This has resolved many long-standing questions about these mysterious structures.
Whittingham says this achievement inspires him to continue his research and understand the remaining mysteries of radio waves.

https://www.ndtv.com/science/study-reveals-hidden-deep-earth-structures-that-rewrite-planets-history-9691500,Study Reveals Hidden Deep-Earth Structures That Can Rewrite Planet's History,"Mon, 24 Nov 2025 23:16:08 +0530","A new study offers a fresh explanation for two mysterious structures hidden nearly 1,800 miles beneath our feet. For decades, scientists have struggled to understand these enormous formations because their size, shape and strange behaviour do not match traditional ideas about how Earth formed. Now, new research published in Nature Geoscience may finally help solve this puzzle and reveal how these deep-Earth processes shaped the planet we live on today, reportedScience Daily.
This new understanding comes from a study by a team led by Rutgers University geodynamicist Yoshinori Miyazaki. The research focused on two unique structures at the boundary between Earth's mantle and core, Large Low-Shear-Velocity Provinces (LLSVPs) and Ultra-Low-Velocity Zones (ULVZs).
LLSVPs are vast regions of extremely hot and dense rock, one located beneath Africa and the other beneath the Pacific Ocean. ULVZs, on the other hand, are thin, partially molten layers that appear as small pockets of sediment above the core. Both structures significantly attenuate seismic waves, indicating that they contain materials or conditions different from the surrounding mantle.
According to Miyazaki, these structures are neither coincidental nor anomalous. He said these are like traces of Earth's early history, and understanding them could help explain how Earth formed and became habitable.
Miyazaki explained that Earth was once covered by a vast ocean of molten rock. As this magma ocean cooled, scientists expected clear chemical layers to develop in the mantle, much like the separation of juice's sweet and watery parts when it freezes.
But seismic studies don't reveal such layers. Instead, LLSVPs and ULVZs appear as irregular patches at the bottom of the mantle.
The team believes that the missing element is Earth's core. Their models suggest that over billions of years, elements like silicon and magnesium gradually migrated from the core to the mantle. This mixing prevented the mantle from forming the expected chemical layers.
This same process also shaped the unique structure of LLSVPs and ULVZs. According to the researchers, these structures are the cooled remnants of ""basal magma oceans"" that were altered by material ejected from the core. Miyazaki says that taking this material into account makes sense for why these structures look the way they do today.
Miyazaki said that these processes between the mantle and core can influence not only the chemical composition but also the Earth's heat flow, volcanic activity, and the evolution of its atmosphere. This could help explain why water and life survived on Earth, while Venus became extremely hot and Mars became cold and lifeless.
They explained that Earth's atmosphere is stable, Venus's atmosphere is very dense and filled primarily with carbon dioxide, while Mars' atmosphere is very thin. The cooling of each planet and the evolution of its internal structures may be a major factor in these differences.
By combining seismic data, mineral physics, and geodynamic modelling, the team demonstrated that deep structures like LLSVPs and ULVZs are important evidence of Earth's formation. The research also indicates that these regions may have played a key role in powering volcanic hotspots like Hawaii and Iceland, providing a direct link between Earth's internal and external processes.
Co-author Ji Deng said this study is an example of how collaboration between different scientific fields can help solve Earth's long-standing mysteries. He added that chemical traces of early core-mantle interactions may still be present in the mantle, opening new avenues for understanding Earth's unique evolution.
Researchers say each new discovery brings them closer to piecing together Earth's early history. Previously disparate clues now appear to form a clearer and more connected story.

A giant object the size of Mars, named Theia, crashed into Earth 4.5 billion years ago. This huge impact not only formed the Moon but also changed Earth's shape, mass, and composition. But now, new research suggests we may have misunderstood this event for a long time, reportedNY Post.
Scientists from the journal Science and the Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research (MPS) say the famous collision might not have happened by chance after all. Their findings could change the way we understand how the Moon, and even Earth itself, came to be.
Early in the solar system, it is believed that Earth collided with a large, Mars-like object-Theia. This powerful impact ejected a large amount of material into space, and the debris later formed the Moon.
This event wasn't limited to the formation of the Moon. It also altered Earth's initial structure, giving it the mass and chemical composition it possesses today.
New studies question the idea that Theia's collision was purely coincidental. Scientists believe there may be deeper reasons behind this collision, explaining how and why it occurred.
According to researchers, the composition of a planet or celestial body holds the entire story of its formation and origin. Thorsten Klein of the Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research says that the elements present within a planet reflect its birth history. This suggests that the collision was likely part of a predetermined sequence or process, rather than just a random event.
Despite these new findings, some scientists remain cautious. Dr. Paul Byrne, a planetary scientist at Washington University in St. Louis, said that while researchers have collected information by examining a wide variety of samples, he is still hesitant to immediately accept these new findings.
He said that no matter how much effort scientists make, much of the past remains a mystery, because the past is truly ""lost to us.""

https://www.ndtv.com/science/astronomers-spot-possible-primordial-cluster-beyond-neptune-9686401,Astronomers Spot Possible Primordial Cluster Beyond Neptune,"Sun, 23 Nov 2025 18:51:27 +0530","Astronomers believe they may have discovered evidence of a mysterious structure far beyond Neptune, hidden deep inside the Kuiper Belt. This new finding could help scientists understand what the early solar system looked like billions of years ago. The study points to a dense group of icy objects that may have remained untouched since the beginning of the solar system. Although the research is still being reviewed, the possible implications are significant, reportedDaily Galaxy.
The Kuiper Belt is often referred to as the solar system's ""third region."" It extends approximately 30 to 50 astronomical units (AU) from the Sun and contains icy remnants left behind during the solar system's formation.
According to NASA, this region lies beyond the orbit of Neptune, in the outer reaches of the solar system. Scientists estimate that millions of icy objects may exist here, many of which are over 60 miles (100 kilometres) across, while some, like Pluto, are larger than 600 miles (1,000 kilometres).
Like the asteroid belt, the Kuiper Belt is composed of fragments left over from incomplete planet formation. The difference is that while the asteroid belt is thin, the Kuiper Belt forms a thick, doughnut-like structure, shaped specifically by the gravity of the giant planets, including Neptune. This gravitational influence has caused the positions and distribution of objects in this region to change over time.
Despite long-term study, scientists still don't fully understand the structure of the Kuiper Belt. In 2011, researchers discovered that it isn't a uniform and linear region. A study published in The Astronomical Journal described it as a complex region with multiple substructures. The research also revealed that the classical belt contains multiple components that extend far beyond the traditionally described inner, core, and outer regions.
A team of scientists from Princeton University, led by astrophysicist Aamir Siraj, has identified a new structure at a distance of approximately 43 AU. They believe it could be a ""primordial cluster""-a group of icy objects that has existed virtually unchanged since the early solar system. Siraj told New Scientist that the extremely calm and stable orbits of these objects indicate the region's antiquity and minimal disruption. According to them, this stability could provide important insights into the early history and evolution of the Solar System.
This discovery could also help explain how giant planets formed and gradually reached their current orbits. Scientists also suggest that this structure could hold insights into the early interstellar conditions the Solar System faced during its formation.
This study builds on a 2011 discovery that identified a ""kernel"" region of the Kuiper Belt, a region where objects' orbits remain stable and have low eccentricity over long periods of time. The new structure, located slightly inside this older kernel, shows even lower eccentricity, suggesting it may be even older and more stable.
According to Princeton researchers, the classical belt's structure should be understood as consisting of three major components, a ""hot"" component with a wide variation in orbits, and two ""cold"" components, called the core and the kernel. Now, the new structure discovered at 43 AU, with an even lower eccentricity, raises the possibility that an ""inner kernel"" may exist, possibly formed earlier and experiencing less disruption than other parts of the Kuiper Belt.

https://www.ndtv.com/science/stealth-solar-storm-hit-earth-leaving-scientists-surprised-9686088,"Stealth Solar Storm Hits Earth, Leaves Scientists Surprised","Sun, 23 Nov 2025 16:19:26 +0530","A solar storm quietly reached Earth on November 20, surprising scientists because it arrived without any warning signs. This type of eruption, called a stealth solar storm, is unusual because it cannot be easily seen in regular solar images. Even though this event did not trigger a geomagnetic storm, it may have helped create auroras visible in some mid-latitude regions, reportedSpace.com.
Stealth solar storms are coronal mass ejections (CMEs) that emerge from the Sun but leave almost no visible traces along their path. Normal CMEs are easily detected in solar observations, but stealth CMEs erupt extremely quietly and slowly, making them extremely challenging to track.
While normal CMEs appear as bright flares, sudden changes in ultraviolet light, or large loop-like formations rising from the Sun's surface, and coronagraphs capture them as large, diffuse clouds, stealth CMEs behave in the opposite way. They appear very faint, move slowly, and leave no bright signature behind. Because of this, scientists often detect them only when they approach Earth and disrupt the solar wind.
This is exactly what happened on November 20th. NOAA experts observed unusual changes in solar wind patterns and speculated that a stealth CME may have struck Earth. On that day, the solar wind was primarily influenced by a coronal hole's high-speed stream with negative polarity. They also recorded a signal called an ""embedded transient,"" which is believed to be a hidden clue to a stealth CME.
The most significant signal was a sudden increase in the magnetic field. The solar wind speed was between 400-500 km/s, which is higher than the normal speed around Earth.
Space weather expert Tamitha Skov reported on social media that stealth solar storms have become active again. She said they are called ""stealthy"" because they leave no visible trace in observations of the Sun's disk or coronagraph. According to her, such storms are only detected when they collide with Earth.
They added that this event is likely to cause a mild geomagnetic storm at high latitudes. However, they also warned that when stealth CMEs pass near high-speed solar wind currents, they can in some cases produce more powerful storms than expected.
Stealth CMEs are typically more common when the Sun is in the waning phase of its 11-year solar activity cycle. During this time, the Sun's magnetic activity changes, increasing the likelihood of unusual events.
Although the November 20th storm did not pose a major threat, its nature is significant. It highlights how unpredictable the Sun can be and reminds us that even seemingly quiet eruptions can impact Earth's space environment.

The event, known as a coronal mass ejection (CME), was detected using the European Space Agency's XMM-Newton space observatory and the LOFAR radio telescope. The findings, published in the journal Nature, offer scientists a new way to understand how stars influence the planets that orbit them, reportedEuro News.
A CME is formed when a large amount of plasma is violently ejected from a star's upper atmosphere and spreads into space. Such intense eruptions affect the surrounding space, and scientists classify them as ""space weather."" This includes solar storms, which can produce auroras on Earth and weaken the atmospheres of nearby planets.
For many years, astronomers have been trying to observe CMEs on other stars, as such eruptions play a crucial role in determining whether a planet can remain habitable. Henrik Eklund, a scientist at the European Space Research and Technology Centre in the Netherlands, says this discovery provides new opportunities to understand space weather and eruptions on other stars. He says researchers will no longer be limited to the Sun as an example to understand CMEs.
The researchers also noted that smaller stars can produce much more powerful and intense space weather than the Sun. Such intense activity can determine whether planets orbiting such stars can retain their atmospheres and remain habitable.
This CME, observed outside our solar system, had so much energy that it could completely strip any planet in its path. This CME was moving at an incredible speed of about 2,400 kilometres per second, a speed only recorded in about one in twenty CMEs occurring on the Sun. According to the study, this explosion was not only fast but also so intense that any planet near the star would not be able to retain its atmosphere.
This event originated from a red dwarf star, which is much dimmer, cooler, and smaller than the Sun, with a mass approximately half that of the Sun. Research revealed that this star rotates about 20 times faster than the Sun and has a magnetic field about 300 times stronger. Since most of the planets in our galaxy have been found to orbit similar stars, this observation is considered extremely important in understanding the actual conditions of those planets.

They warn that ""rapid industrialisation"" has changed human habits so quickly that our biology may struggle to keep up. Crowded, polluted cities and a lack of connection with nature could be affecting key biological functions that are essential for survival and reproduction, reportedNewsweek.
According to researchers, living in cities can have a negative impact on reproductive health, causing problems like infertility and decreased sperm count. It can also affect the immune system, increasing the risk of allergies and autoimmune diseases. Additionally, cognitive abilities may decline, leading to slower mental development and faster mental aging, while physical strength and stamina may also decrease.
Fertility rates are falling worldwide, and chronic diseases are on the rise. It is estimated that by 2050, approximately 68 percent of people will live in cities, making the consequences of these impacts potentially severe. Danny Longman, senior lecturer in human evolutionary physiology at Loughborough University, said that for most of human history our biological structure was adapted to the natural environment, but industrialisation has changed the environment around us so rapidly that our bodies have not been able to fully adapt to it. He called this the ""Environmental Mismatch Hypothesis,"" that is, humans are not fully adapted to modern urban life.
Longman said the study combined findings from laboratory experiments, field studies and population research. Instead of gathering new information, researchers reviewed data from anthropology, ecology, physiology, and public health to understand how the modern environment impacts the human body. Their findings revealed both short- and long-term effects of living in cities.
The body's stress response mechanisms are constantly activated by the daily noise, crowds, traffic, constant digital stimulation and limited access to nature in the city. This may result in increased anxiety, disrupted sleep, and decreased ability to concentrate. Over time, these persistent stresses can lead to mental health problems, stress on the heart, cognitive impairment, immune system imbalances, and decreased reproductive health.
Polluted, noisy and crowded urban environments can impair physical performance, especially in endurance tasks. Longman points out that commuting on busy city streets isn't just inconvenient, it can have real biological consequences.
Researchers believe that due to increasing population and expansion of cities, humans will not be able to return to natural habitats soon. The study shows that understanding the mismatch between modern urban life and our biological makeup is vital to addressing the health challenges facing today's cities.

The animal, known as ""Yuka,"" was found near Siberia's Arctic coast in 2010 and had been preserved in ice for almost 40,000 years. Researchers now say that Yuka's body holds traces of ancient RNA, delicate genetic molecules that normally break down soon after death. This discovery offers a new way to understand prehistoric life, reportedNational Geographic.
Scientists recently reported that Yuka's tissues contained another rare treasure such as remains of ribonucleic acid (RNA), and the genetic molecules essential to life.
Normally RNA is destroyed soon after death, so this is considered to be the oldest RNA discovered so far and it has been obtained for the first time from the woolly mammoth. This study has been published in Cell journal.
Scientists have been studying DNA fragments from mammoth specimens for decades, and with the help of this genetic information, they have created the genome of this species and discovered how close mammoths are to modern elephants. But RNA has been difficult to find because it is less stable than DNA.
Like DNA, RNA is single-stranded and plays an important role in activating genes and making proteins.
RNA is also important in the study of viruses, such as influenza and coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). Love Co-author Love Dalen, a developmental genomics researcher at Stockholm University said that with the help of ancient RNA, signs of Ice Age viruses present with ancient animals trapped in ice can be discovered. RNA viruses were not found in yuca, but traces of ancient pathogens may be found in other prehistoric samples.
Scientists previously believed that RNA decays so quickly that it cannot survive for more than a few centuries, much less thousands of years. Recent studies have challenged this belief. In 2023, Dalen's team obtained RNA from the skin and muscle of a Tasmanian tiger specimen that had been kept in a museum for more than 130 years. In 2017 researchers extracted RNA from the stomach tissue of a 5,300-year-old ice mummy.
To search for even older RNA, Pour and his team focused on the permafrost regions of Siberia, where thawing soil has yielded many amazing discoveries. In addition to mammoth specimens like Yuka, researchers have also found skin and muscle tissue from mummified saber-tooth cat cubs and other frozen animals.
These discoveries suggest that permanent ice may hold even more secrets of prehistoric life, including ancient gene activation and possibly even long-lost viruses.

The mission, called Lunar Polar Exploration Mission (LUPEX), also known as Chandrayaan-5, will attempt to land near the Moon's South Pole to search for water ice, a resource that could unlock permanent human presence beyond Earth.
The collaboration between Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) is historic. For the first time, the two countries are combining their strengths - India will provide the lander, leveraging its proven technology from Chandrayaan-3, while Japan will contribute its powerful H3 launch vehicle and a sophisticated rover. The mission is slated for launch in 2028.
""Water is really essential for survival of humankind,"" says Dr Saku Tsuneta, Vice Chair of the Committee on National Space Policy, Cabinet Office, Government of Japan. ""If you want to go to the Moon and if you want to live on the Moon, you need water for survival. Bringing water from Earth is extremely expensive.""
Beyond drinking and life support, water on the Moon can be split into hydrogen and oxygen, creating rocket fuel for future missions to Mars and beyond. ""If you have water, you can create fuel so that you can fly elsewhere from the Moon, to say Mars,"" Dr Tsuneta explains. This makes water the single most valuable resource for space exploration.
The rover, expected to weigh around 350 kilograms, will be the heaviest ever sent to the Moon.
The mission will target the Moon's polar regions, where conditions favour the presence of ice. ""In the equatorial region, it is illuminated by heavy sunshine and it's extremely hot, so any form of water is vaporised,"" says Dr Tsuneta. ""In the polar region, the sun illuminates horizontally, so there are multiple shadows by the mountains where you can find ice.""
Landing in this rugged terrain is no easy task. But India's success with Chandrayaan-3 gives Japan confidence. ""India has already landed successfully in the polar region. So, we fully rely on India's ability to land on the desired area, where we surely find water, ice,"" he adds.
The rover, expected to weigh around 350 kilograms, will be the heaviest ever sent to the Moon. It is designed to operate for 100 days, enduring extreme lunar conditions. The biggest challenge is surviving the lunar night, when temperatures plunge below -100 degrees Celsius and sunlight disappears for two weeks. Without a radioactive heat source, engineers have devised an innovative solution. ""This rover has a mechanism to protect itself to reduce heat dissipation,"" says Dr Tsuneta. ""It insulates itself, and when the night comes, the insulator protects the rover. It's like giving the rover a sweater."" He says currently the 'rover is over-weight and ISRO wants a slimmer rover'.
The race to find water is not just scientific - it's strategic. ""The United States, European countries, Japan and India all try to find water as early as possible. Otherwise, someone else finds the water. They may say, this is ours,"" warns Dr Tsuneta.
Permanent lunar habitation will require building infrastructure using local resources. ""Rather than bringing things from Earth, you have to create buildings and systems there by Moon material,"" he says. ""One country cannot do everything. This is where Japan and India should work together.""
LUPEX, if successful, will pave the way for human bases on the Moon, enabling sustainable exploration and serving as a launch pad for interplanetary travel. ""ISRO is an excellent partner for us,"" Dr Tsuneta emphasises. ""They have a landing technology which is quite reliable. India had a successful landing already. So we have full confidence in ISRO's reliability.""

Twenty-six people, including one Nepali national, were killed and many others were injured as multiple terrorists descended on Baisaran Valley, known as ""Mini Switzerland"" - a tourist hotspot with rolling hills and verdant orchards - and opened fire last week. According to eyewitnesses, as the gunshots rang out, there was panic among the tourists who ran for cover. However, there was no place for them to hide in the wide, open space.
Security forces have launched search operations to track down the terrorists involved in the attack. While India has taken strict action against Pakistan by suspending the decades-old Indus Waters Treaty indefinitely and sending all Pakistani nationals back.
The attack has been one of the biggest terror attacks after the abrogation of Article 370 in 2019.

Celebrities like MrBeast and Elon Musk weighed in, and even the White House used the meme for commentary on immigration policy.
The internet is abuzz with a peculiar question: could 100 unarmed men take down a single adult male gorilla in a fight? Thedebatewas sparked by X user Michael Sherrills on April 24, and it has since snowballed into a full-blown phenomenon, captivating the attention of celebrities and politicians alike.YouTube star MrBeast poked fun at the idea, posting a fake thumbnail titled ""100 Men vs. a Gorilla"" and jokingly asking for volunteers. Elon Musk said: ""Sure, what's the worst that could happen?""
Even the White House got in on the action, using the meme to make a pointed commentary on immigration. Their post featured a photo of immigrants boarding a plane with an image of President Donald Trump, captioned: ""100 men vs 1 gorilla is still up for debate. Meanwhile, 142,000+ illegal alien criminals went up against 1 President Trump - They all got deported.""

The White House's post seemed to endorse Trump's hardline immigration record. According to ICE, during Trump's initial 100 days in office, 66,463 people were detained without proper documentation, and 65,682 were deported.
Michael Sherrills, the man behind the original question, expressed surprise at the frenzy his query sparked and he toldNBC, ""The thing people love the most is things that probably won't ever happen, because you can debate about it,"" he said. ""It's like tasting a dream, you know what I'm saying? And I think people love to feel it out."" Sherrills remains confident that 100 men could defeat a gorilla, but with some caveats.

Fanjoy's positive campaign, door-knocking, and Poilievre's perceived absence led to this significant win.
In a stunning upset, Bruce Fanjoy, a stay-at-home dad and Liberal candidate, has defeated Pierre Poilievre, the leader of the Conservative Party, in the Carleton electoral district, with over 4,300 votes. This remarkable victory not only marked the end of Poilievre's 20-year tenure as the MP for Carleton but also dealt a significant blow to his bid for prime minister.
Fanjoy's campaign was built on a foundation of positivity and hard work. ""We ran a positive campaign, in remarkable contrast to Pierre's style of politics,"" he toldPolitico Magazine. ""We attracted a small army of volunteers, and as the campaign carried on, more and more people believed in what we were doing."" Fanjoy's dedication to his constituents was evident in his door-knocking efforts, which began in 2023. ""I wore through two pairs of sneakers and a pair of boots,"" he recalled.
The turning point in the campaign came when Donald Trump's threats against Canada began to escalate. ""There was a sea change in what I was hearing at the doors,"" Fanjoy said. ""Canadians recognised we were facing another U.S. administration led by Donald Trump and some of his hostile rhetoric toward Canada, our economy, and our political sovereignty."" This shift in public opinion, combined with Poilievre's perceived absence from the riding, ultimately sealed his fate.
Fanjoy attributed his success to his team's tireless efforts and Poilievre's complacency. ""We outworked him,"" he said. ""We were present, we were all over the riding, and we were connecting with voters. People appreciated the fact that we were present and that we offered a positive alternative to Pierre."" Fanjoy also noted that Poilievre's absence from the riding was a significant factor in his defeat. ""If there was one surprise that I had in this campaign in Carleton, it's that Pierre barely showed up,"" he said. ""After all his time as MP, he took the riding for granted, and nobody likes to be taken for granted.""
As a first-time politician, Fanjoy remains committed to his values and principles. ""I know who I am, and I'm going to be true to my values,"" he said. ""I grew up playing competitive sports, I had a career in the private sector, so I understand what it's like to compete."" Fanjoy's victory is seen as a referendum on Poilievre's leadership style and a rejection of his conservative ideology. ""The result is very clear that Canadians want responsible leadership,"" Fanjoy said. ""They want serious leadership, and this is no time to be flirting with the kind of politics that we're seeing down to the south.""
With the Liberal Party now forming a minority government, Fanjoy expects the party to govern with principle and in the best interests of Canadians. ""We'll govern with principle, we'll govern in the best interests of Canadians,"" he said. ""This Liberal government is filled with people who are committed to their communities and committed to this country.""

He aims to advise President Trump part-time post his term expiry in May. Despite stepping back, he believes DOGE can thrive independently.
Elon Musk, the head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) will be minimising his work in the government, and he's embracing his role as a visionary leader, likening himself to Buddha, perThe Washington Post. When asked who would succeed him, Musk replied, ""Is Buddha needed for Buddhism? Was it not stronger after he passed away?""Musk's departure from DOGE is necessitated by his limited term as a special government employee, which expires in May. Despite this, he expressed his willingness to continue contributing to the government on a part-time basis. ""I'm willing to contribute on average, one to two days a week... as long as the president wants me to do it,"" Musk said. He envisions dedicating a few days each month to advising President Donald Trump and the Vice President. ""Obviously, if the president or the Cabinet has an emergency that they want me to respond to, then I'll do that,"" Musk added.
As Musk refocuses on his business ventures, including Tesla, X, and Starlink, speculation surrounds his successor. Recently, Tesla's board allegedly sought executive search firms to identify potential candidates for a possible leadership transition. Musk swiftly responded to the report, labeling it ""deliberately false"" and a ""breach of ethics.""
Despite stepping back from DOGE, Musk remains committed to the initiative, describing it as ""a way of life... like Buddhism."" He claims DOGE has achieved $160 billion in estimated savings and aims to reach $1 trillion. According to Musk, the DOGE's success is not solely dependent on his leadership. ""DOGE is kind of a way of life... we make converts all the time,"" he said, expressing confidence in the team's ability to sustain momentum.
Musk's working relationship with Trump appears to be informal and friendly, with the billionaire often staying overnight at the White House. ""The president is - I guess we're good friends,"" Musk said. Trump has even offered Musk the Lincoln Bedroom, complete with a tour of its history. The two have also shared late-night ice cream invitations. ""He'll actually call, like, late at night and say, 'Oh, by the way, make sure you get some ice cream from the kitchen,'"" Musk said.
He spoke about gaining three pounds in one night. ""It was epic. I mean, don't tell RFK,"" he said, referencing Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. He also recalled how he played video games such as Diablo and “Pathfinder” on a large computer monitor in his West Wing office.
In a candid conversation, Musk shared his thoughts on the DOGE's office space, describing it as ""comically tiny"" with a view of the HVAC unit. ""It's harder to shoot me there... there's not a good line of sight,"" he joked.
Musk remains optimistic about DOGE's prospects, believing it can endure without his direct involvement. With around 100 employees currently working on DOGE, Musk is confident that the initiative will continue to make progress, possibly for the duration of Trump's second term.
But he also spoke about the hardships of working at DOGE. ""It's like 60 percent fun, 70 percent fun. Depends on the week,"" he said. ""Being attacked relentlessly is not super fun. Seeing cars burning is not fun."" He compared the department to a ""start-up"", saying ""things have been very intense"".

Notable wins included Ruby Sahota and Anita Anand, while NDP leader Jagmeet Singh lost his seat.
The 2025 Canadian federal elections have marked a historic milestone for the Punjabi community, with a record 22 candidates of Punjabi origin securing seats in the House of Commons. This impressive representation accounts for over 6% of Canada's parliament, showcasing the growing influence of the Punjabi diaspora in the country's politics.
In Brampton, a city known for its strong Punjabi presence, the election results were particularly noteworthy. Five constituencies in Brampton featured candidates with Punjabi names. Ruby Sahota, a Liberal, defeated Amandeep Judge, a Conservative, in Brampton North, while Maninder Siddhu, a Liberal, beat Bob Dosanjh, a Conservative, in Brampton East and Sonia Siddhu, a Liberal defeated Sukhdeep Kang, a Conservative, in Brampton South.
Beyond Brampton, other Punjabi Canadian politicians made significant wins. Anita Anand, a former innovation minister, retained her seat in Oakville East, while Bardish Chagger, a veteran politician known for her work on diversity and inclusion, secured a win in Waterloo. Other Liberal winners included Anju Dhillon, Sukh Dhaliwal, Randeep Sarai, and Param Bains. The Conservative Party also saw success with candidates of Punjabi origin, including Jasraj Hallan, Dalwinder Gill, Amanpreet Gill, Arpan Khanna, Tim Uppal, Parm Gill, Sukhman Gill, Jagsharan Singh Mahal and Harb Gill.
However, not all prominent Punjabi politicians fared well. Jagmeet Singh, the leader of the New Democratic Party (NDP), lost his seat in Burnaby Central, finishing third and subsequently resigning as NDP president. This unexpected outcome has sent shockwaves through Canada's political landscape.
The success of Punjabi Canadians in the 2025 elections reflects the growing clout of the Indian diaspora, particularly the Punjabi Sikh community, in shaping policies in one of the world's most progressive democracies.

This was Laura Coleman-Day's 13th marathon this year. The woman from Lincolnshire, England, raised money to support a cancer charity and in the memory of her husband Xander.
Ms Coleman-Day's husband Xander died in 2024 due to complications following a transplant he required after being diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, a rare form of cancer that affects the bone marrow and blood, theBBCreported.
The 33-year-old completed the marathon alongside her Guernsey-based friend Kate Walford, who is also doing several marathons in memory of her best friend who died from leukaemia in 2018.
She described finishing the marathon on her wedding anniversary as ""absolutely amazing"" after running the final three miles wearing the dress.
On her sixth wedding anniversary, Ms Coleman-Day stopped running for a time in the 23rd mile of the 26.2-mile marathon to put on the wedding gown so she could wear it to the end of the marathon.
""I thought that going overboard with my wedding gown would be the ideal way to honour the day and Xander,"" Ms Coleman-Day told BBC News.
""Kate and I are going to stop at mile 23 and put my wedding dress on,"" she added,Peoplereported.
She claimed it was ""hot"" to finish the race wearing the outfit, but she did it with Ms Walford. ""It was absolutely amazing,"" Ms Coleman-Day said.
Ms Coleman-Day married Xander, a Royal Air Force aerospace battle manager, in 2019. The two had a son, Amos, a few years later.
Mr Xander began complaining of aches and pains, and physicians diagnosed him with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) by 2022, she told local outletLincolnshire Live.
He was deemed cancer-free in December 2022 but had a relapse shortly after receiving treatment.
Despite his optimism, the cancer eventually claimed Mr Xander's life in February 2024 at the age of 36. Their son was two years old at the time.
Ms Coleman-Day ran the London Marathon to raise money for Anthony Nolan, a charity which works in the fields of leukaemia and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.

Why US Cars Are A Rare Sight In Japan,"Fri, 02 May 2025 12:56:30 +0530","With their sleek curves and chrome grilles, the classic American cars on sale at Yosuke Fukuda's yard ooze Californian cool but on Japanese roads new US vehicles are a rare sight -- much to President Donald Trump's annoyance.
Japan's Toyota is the second-top-selling automaker in the United States, where it shifted more than 2.3 million vehicles last year.
Meanwhile US industry leader General Motors sold just 587 Chevrolets and 449 Cadillacs in Japan, while Ford pulled out of the tough Japanese market nearly a decade ago.
And it's not just an aversion to foreign brands -- in 2024 Mercedes-Benz sold more than 53,000 vehicles and BMW sold over 52,000 including Minis.
""They don't take our cars, but we take MILLIONS of theirs!"" Trump said in April, accusing Japan of treating its ally ""very poorly on trade"".
To try and rev up the US auto industry, Trump has imposed a 25 percent levy on imported vehicles, in a major blow to Tokyo.
Many people in Japan admire vintage US cars, but when it comes to new wheels, they hold more trust in domestic brands, Fukuda told AFP.
West Coast hip-hop booms out at his shop Y-Tech, an incongruous slice of Americana amid the rice paddies north of Tokyo.
""To be honest I think the problem is the size of the roads,"" as well as an impression that US cars break down more often, which is likely unfounded, Fukuda said.
At his garage, the 20 or so classic US models in varying states of restoration include a silver-green 1970 Chevrolet Nova and a 1954 Buick Roadmaster.
But Fukuda also drives a modern SUV -- a General Motors Yukon, which is two metres (6.5 feet) wide and ""sticks out or is packed in"" when parked in Tokyo's narrow streets.
Although some US cars are smaller, the brands remain a niche choice because ""there are hardly any places that sell them or repair them"", he said.
Yuka Fujimoto, a 42-year-old modelling agency manager, told AFP she had never considered buying a US car.
""American cars don't sell very well"" in Japan, where domestic automakers offer ""a wide range of line-ups including for families"", she said.
However Trump believes Japan is keeping out American cars with ""non-tariff cheating"".
This includes ""Protective Technical Standards (Japan's bowling ball test)"" he wrote last month on Truth Social.
""They take a bowling ball from 20 feet up in the air and they drop it on the hood of the car. And if the hood dents, then the car doesn't qualify,"" Trump reportedly elaborated in 2018.
A Japanese transport ministry official in charge of safety standards told AFP that no actual bowling balls are used.
Trump ""may be mixing it up with a test where a hemispherical human head model is hit on the hood"", the official said.
But the car's bonnet is in fact required to dent to absorb the impact, he explained.
Tweaking Japan's vehicle import procedures is a potential bargaining chip for Tokyo in tariff talks with Washington.
The country could offer to widen access to a simplified screening process which currently applies to 5,000 vehicles per model annually, Japanese media reports said.
Trump's auto tariffs have already brought some changes, with Nissan last month revising plans to reduce US production.
Meanwhile Honda is moving production of its hybrid Civic model from Japan to the United States, saying no ""single issue"" had prompted the decision.
But US carmakers still face the problem of tepid demand among Japanese consumers.
Hisashi Uchida, a 56-year-old construction firm employee, said his Toyota car ""doesn't have any special features, but it doesn't break down"".
""Many American cars can't be parked at multi-storey parking lots, and their fuel efficiency isn't good,"" he said.
Overall ""I don't think US carmakers are really putting importance on the Japanese market, which is significantly smaller than their home market"", said Masamitsu Misawa, chief editor of Japanese vehicle magazine Car Top.
In contrast, German car brands offer a better range and their designs ""better match Japanese people's tastes"", he told AFP.
Cars in Japan drive on the left, and unlike US rivals European automakers usually put the steering wheel on the correct side for vehicles sold there, he added.
That could be changing. General Motors' 8th-generation Chevrolet Corvette has right-hand drive in Japan for the first time.
""I think that reflects efforts (for selling in Japan) by manufacturers and importers,"" Misawa said.

The statement came in response to the US government's latest claims that the virus likely leaked from a lab in Wuhan, China.
China hit back, accusing the US of ""shamelessly politicising"" the virus' origins.
In a white paper, Chinese officials said, ""Substantial evidence suggested the Covid-19 might have emerged in the United States earlier than its officially-claimed timeline, and earlier than the outbreak in China."" The paper also focused on Beijing's long-standing position that a lab leak is ""extremely unlikely,"" citing a joint World Health Organization (WHO)-China study.
""The US government, instead of facing squarely its failure in response to COVID-19 and reflecting on its shortcomings, has tried to shift the blame and divert people's attention by shamelessly politicising SARS-CoV-2 origins tracing,"" the Chinese government said. The US should not ""pretend to be deaf and dumb,"" they said.
The white paper alleged Washington evaded responsibility and attempted to distract from its mishandling of the pandemic. ""The US should cease from shifting blame and evading responsibility, stop finding external excuses for its internal malaise, and genuinely reflect on and overhaul its public health policies,"" the document read. ""The US cannot continue to turn a deaf ear to the numerous questions over its conduct,"" they said, as perFox News.
The strongly worded document followed the White House's decision earlier this month to revamp its COVID.gov website. The updated site pushes the theory that COVID-19 leaked from the Wuhan Institute of Virology, describes it as the ""most likely"" origin, and criticises former US officials such as Dr Anthony Fauci and former President Joe Biden.
""A lab-related incident involving gain-of-function research is most likely the origin of COVID-19,"" reads the updated White House section. It also asserts that current oversight of such research is ""incomplete, severely convoluted, and lack[s] global applicability.""
The new US stance cites biological features in the virus that allegedly don't occur in nature and suggests that if a natural origin were true, evidence would have surfaced by now. The website also references a past lawsuit that resulted in a $24 billion judgment against China for allegedly hoarding protective gear and covering up the early outbreak, as perCNN.
Earlier this year, the CIA shifted its assessment, saying the pandemic most likely started in a lab, though the agency said it was ""low confidence"". In its conclusion, it said both lab and natural origins remain plausible.
An official from China's National Health Commission added that the next phase of COVID-19 origin tracing should focus on the US.

Harvard had responded by earlier by saying that the removal of its tax exempt status would jeopardise critical research, its educational mission and reduce financial aid for students.

Fanjoy's positive campaign, door-knocking, and Poilievre's perceived absence led to this significant win.
In a stunning upset, Bruce Fanjoy, a stay-at-home dad and Liberal candidate, has defeated Pierre Poilievre, the leader of the Conservative Party, in the Carleton electoral district, with over 4,300 votes. This remarkable victory not only marked the end of Poilievre's 20-year tenure as the MP for Carleton but also dealt a significant blow to his bid for prime minister.
Fanjoy's campaign was built on a foundation of positivity and hard work. ""We ran a positive campaign, in remarkable contrast to Pierre's style of politics,"" he toldPolitico Magazine. ""We attracted a small army of volunteers, and as the campaign carried on, more and more people believed in what we were doing."" Fanjoy's dedication to his constituents was evident in his door-knocking efforts, which began in 2023. ""I wore through two pairs of sneakers and a pair of boots,"" he recalled.
The turning point in the campaign came when Donald Trump's threats against Canada began to escalate. ""There was a sea change in what I was hearing at the doors,"" Fanjoy said. ""Canadians recognised we were facing another U.S. administration led by Donald Trump and some of his hostile rhetoric toward Canada, our economy, and our political sovereignty."" This shift in public opinion, combined with Poilievre's perceived absence from the riding, ultimately sealed his fate.
Fanjoy attributed his success to his team's tireless efforts and Poilievre's complacency. ""We outworked him,"" he said. ""We were present, we were all over the riding, and we were connecting with voters. People appreciated the fact that we were present and that we offered a positive alternative to Pierre."" Fanjoy also noted that Poilievre's absence from the riding was a significant factor in his defeat. ""If there was one surprise that I had in this campaign in Carleton, it's that Pierre barely showed up,"" he said. ""After all his time as MP, he took the riding for granted, and nobody likes to be taken for granted.""
As a first-time politician, Fanjoy remains committed to his values and principles. ""I know who I am, and I'm going to be true to my values,"" he said. ""I grew up playing competitive sports, I had a career in the private sector, so I understand what it's like to compete."" Fanjoy's victory is seen as a referendum on Poilievre's leadership style and a rejection of his conservative ideology. ""The result is very clear that Canadians want responsible leadership,"" Fanjoy said. ""They want serious leadership, and this is no time to be flirting with the kind of politics that we're seeing down to the south.""
With the Liberal Party now forming a minority government, Fanjoy expects the party to govern with principle and in the best interests of Canadians. ""We'll govern with principle, we'll govern in the best interests of Canadians,"" he said. ""This Liberal government is filled with people who are committed to their communities and committed to this country.""

He aims to advise President Trump part-time post his term expiry in May. Despite stepping back, he believes DOGE can thrive independently.
Elon Musk, the head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) will be minimising his work in the government, and he's embracing his role as a visionary leader, likening himself to Buddha, perThe Washington Post. When asked who would succeed him, Musk replied, ""Is Buddha needed for Buddhism? Was it not stronger after he passed away?""Musk's departure from DOGE is necessitated by his limited term as a special government employee, which expires in May. Despite this, he expressed his willingness to continue contributing to the government on a part-time basis. ""I'm willing to contribute on average, one to two days a week... as long as the president wants me to do it,"" Musk said. He envisions dedicating a few days each month to advising President Donald Trump and the Vice President. ""Obviously, if the president or the Cabinet has an emergency that they want me to respond to, then I'll do that,"" Musk added.
As Musk refocuses on his business ventures, including Tesla, X, and Starlink, speculation surrounds his successor. Recently, Tesla's board allegedly sought executive search firms to identify potential candidates for a possible leadership transition. Musk swiftly responded to the report, labeling it ""deliberately false"" and a ""breach of ethics.""
Despite stepping back from DOGE, Musk remains committed to the initiative, describing it as ""a way of life... like Buddhism."" He claims DOGE has achieved $160 billion in estimated savings and aims to reach $1 trillion. According to Musk, the DOGE's success is not solely dependent on his leadership. ""DOGE is kind of a way of life... we make converts all the time,"" he said, expressing confidence in the team's ability to sustain momentum.
Musk's working relationship with Trump appears to be informal and friendly, with the billionaire often staying overnight at the White House. ""The president is - I guess we're good friends,"" Musk said. Trump has even offered Musk the Lincoln Bedroom, complete with a tour of its history. The two have also shared late-night ice cream invitations. ""He'll actually call, like, late at night and say, 'Oh, by the way, make sure you get some ice cream from the kitchen,'"" Musk said.
He spoke about gaining three pounds in one night. ""It was epic. I mean, don't tell RFK,"" he said, referencing Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. He also recalled how he played video games such as Diablo and “Pathfinder” on a large computer monitor in his West Wing office.
In a candid conversation, Musk shared his thoughts on the DOGE's office space, describing it as ""comically tiny"" with a view of the HVAC unit. ""It's harder to shoot me there... there's not a good line of sight,"" he joked.
Musk remains optimistic about DOGE's prospects, believing it can endure without his direct involvement. With around 100 employees currently working on DOGE, Musk is confident that the initiative will continue to make progress, possibly for the duration of Trump's second term.
But he also spoke about the hardships of working at DOGE. ""It's like 60 percent fun, 70 percent fun. Depends on the week,"" he said. ""Being attacked relentlessly is not super fun. Seeing cars burning is not fun."" He compared the department to a ""start-up"", saying ""things have been very intense"".

Notable wins included Ruby Sahota and Anita Anand, while NDP leader Jagmeet Singh lost his seat.
The 2025 Canadian federal elections have marked a historic milestone for the Punjabi community, with a record 22 candidates of Punjabi origin securing seats in the House of Commons. This impressive representation accounts for over 6% of Canada's parliament, showcasing the growing influence of the Punjabi diaspora in the country's politics.
In Brampton, a city known for its strong Punjabi presence, the election results were particularly noteworthy. Five constituencies in Brampton featured candidates with Punjabi names. Ruby Sahota, a Liberal, defeated Amandeep Judge, a Conservative, in Brampton North, while Maninder Siddhu, a Liberal, beat Bob Dosanjh, a Conservative, in Brampton East and Sonia Siddhu, a Liberal defeated Sukhdeep Kang, a Conservative, in Brampton South.
Beyond Brampton, other Punjabi Canadian politicians made significant wins. Anita Anand, a former innovation minister, retained her seat in Oakville East, while Bardish Chagger, a veteran politician known for her work on diversity and inclusion, secured a win in Waterloo. Other Liberal winners included Anju Dhillon, Sukh Dhaliwal, Randeep Sarai, and Param Bains. The Conservative Party also saw success with candidates of Punjabi origin, including Jasraj Hallan, Dalwinder Gill, Amanpreet Gill, Arpan Khanna, Tim Uppal, Parm Gill, Sukhman Gill, Jagsharan Singh Mahal and Harb Gill.
However, not all prominent Punjabi politicians fared well. Jagmeet Singh, the leader of the New Democratic Party (NDP), lost his seat in Burnaby Central, finishing third and subsequently resigning as NDP president. This unexpected outcome has sent shockwaves through Canada's political landscape.
The success of Punjabi Canadians in the 2025 elections reflects the growing clout of the Indian diaspora, particularly the Punjabi Sikh community, in shaping policies in one of the world's most progressive democracies.

This was Laura Coleman-Day's 13th marathon this year. The woman from Lincolnshire, England, raised money to support a cancer charity and in the memory of her husband Xander.
Ms Coleman-Day's husband Xander died in 2024 due to complications following a transplant he required after being diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, a rare form of cancer that affects the bone marrow and blood, theBBCreported.
The 33-year-old completed the marathon alongside her Guernsey-based friend Kate Walford, who is also doing several marathons in memory of her best friend who died from leukaemia in 2018.
She described finishing the marathon on her wedding anniversary as ""absolutely amazing"" after running the final three miles wearing the dress.
On her sixth wedding anniversary, Ms Coleman-Day stopped running for a time in the 23rd mile of the 26.2-mile marathon to put on the wedding gown so she could wear it to the end of the marathon.
""I thought that going overboard with my wedding gown would be the ideal way to honour the day and Xander,"" Ms Coleman-Day told BBC News.
""Kate and I are going to stop at mile 23 and put my wedding dress on,"" she added,Peoplereported.
She claimed it was ""hot"" to finish the race wearing the outfit, but she did it with Ms Walford. ""It was absolutely amazing,"" Ms Coleman-Day said.
Ms Coleman-Day married Xander, a Royal Air Force aerospace battle manager, in 2019. The two had a son, Amos, a few years later.
Mr Xander began complaining of aches and pains, and physicians diagnosed him with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) by 2022, she told local outletLincolnshire Live.
He was deemed cancer-free in December 2022 but had a relapse shortly after receiving treatment.
Despite his optimism, the cancer eventually claimed Mr Xander's life in February 2024 at the age of 36. Their son was two years old at the time.
Ms Coleman-Day ran the London Marathon to raise money for Anthony Nolan, a charity which works in the fields of leukaemia and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.

Why US Cars Are A Rare Sight In Japan,"Fri, 02 May 2025 12:56:30 +0530","With their sleek curves and chrome grilles, the classic American cars on sale at Yosuke Fukuda's yard ooze Californian cool but on Japanese roads new US vehicles are a rare sight -- much to President Donald Trump's annoyance.
Japan's Toyota is the second-top-selling automaker in the United States, where it shifted more than 2.3 million vehicles last year.
Meanwhile US industry leader General Motors sold just 587 Chevrolets and 449 Cadillacs in Japan, while Ford pulled out of the tough Japanese market nearly a decade ago.
And it's not just an aversion to foreign brands -- in 2024 Mercedes-Benz sold more than 53,000 vehicles and BMW sold over 52,000 including Minis.
""They don't take our cars, but we take MILLIONS of theirs!"" Trump said in April, accusing Japan of treating its ally ""very poorly on trade"".
To try and rev up the US auto industry, Trump has imposed a 25 percent levy on imported vehicles, in a major blow to Tokyo.
Many people in Japan admire vintage US cars, but when it comes to new wheels, they hold more trust in domestic brands, Fukuda told AFP.
West Coast hip-hop booms out at his shop Y-Tech, an incongruous slice of Americana amid the rice paddies north of Tokyo.
""To be honest I think the problem is the size of the roads,"" as well as an impression that US cars break down more often, which is likely unfounded, Fukuda said.
At his garage, the 20 or so classic US models in varying states of restoration include a silver-green 1970 Chevrolet Nova and a 1954 Buick Roadmaster.
But Fukuda also drives a modern SUV -- a General Motors Yukon, which is two metres (6.5 feet) wide and ""sticks out or is packed in"" when parked in Tokyo's narrow streets.
Although some US cars are smaller, the brands remain a niche choice because ""there are hardly any places that sell them or repair them"", he said.
Yuka Fujimoto, a 42-year-old modelling agency manager, told AFP she had never considered buying a US car.
""American cars don't sell very well"" in Japan, where domestic automakers offer ""a wide range of line-ups including for families"", she said.
However Trump believes Japan is keeping out American cars with ""non-tariff cheating"".
This includes ""Protective Technical Standards (Japan's bowling ball test)"" he wrote last month on Truth Social.
""They take a bowling ball from 20 feet up in the air and they drop it on the hood of the car. And if the hood dents, then the car doesn't qualify,"" Trump reportedly elaborated in 2018.
A Japanese transport ministry official in charge of safety standards told AFP that no actual bowling balls are used.
Trump ""may be mixing it up with a test where a hemispherical human head model is hit on the hood"", the official said.
But the car's bonnet is in fact required to dent to absorb the impact, he explained.
Tweaking Japan's vehicle import procedures is a potential bargaining chip for Tokyo in tariff talks with Washington.
The country could offer to widen access to a simplified screening process which currently applies to 5,000 vehicles per model annually, Japanese media reports said.
Trump's auto tariffs have already brought some changes, with Nissan last month revising plans to reduce US production.
Meanwhile Honda is moving production of its hybrid Civic model from Japan to the United States, saying no ""single issue"" had prompted the decision.
But US carmakers still face the problem of tepid demand among Japanese consumers.
Hisashi Uchida, a 56-year-old construction firm employee, said his Toyota car ""doesn't have any special features, but it doesn't break down"".
""Many American cars can't be parked at multi-storey parking lots, and their fuel efficiency isn't good,"" he said.
Overall ""I don't think US carmakers are really putting importance on the Japanese market, which is significantly smaller than their home market"", said Masamitsu Misawa, chief editor of Japanese vehicle magazine Car Top.
In contrast, German car brands offer a better range and their designs ""better match Japanese people's tastes"", he told AFP.
Cars in Japan drive on the left, and unlike US rivals European automakers usually put the steering wheel on the correct side for vehicles sold there, he added.
That could be changing. General Motors' 8th-generation Chevrolet Corvette has right-hand drive in Japan for the first time.
""I think that reflects efforts (for selling in Japan) by manufacturers and importers,"" Misawa said.

The statement came in response to the US government's latest claims that the virus likely leaked from a lab in Wuhan, China.
China hit back, accusing the US of ""shamelessly politicising"" the virus' origins.
In a white paper, Chinese officials said, ""Substantial evidence suggested the Covid-19 might have emerged in the United States earlier than its officially-claimed timeline, and earlier than the outbreak in China."" The paper also focused on Beijing's long-standing position that a lab leak is ""extremely unlikely,"" citing a joint World Health Organization (WHO)-China study.
""The US government, instead of facing squarely its failure in response to COVID-19 and reflecting on its shortcomings, has tried to shift the blame and divert people's attention by shamelessly politicising SARS-CoV-2 origins tracing,"" the Chinese government said. The US should not ""pretend to be deaf and dumb,"" they said.
The white paper alleged Washington evaded responsibility and attempted to distract from its mishandling of the pandemic. ""The US should cease from shifting blame and evading responsibility, stop finding external excuses for its internal malaise, and genuinely reflect on and overhaul its public health policies,"" the document read. ""The US cannot continue to turn a deaf ear to the numerous questions over its conduct,"" they said, as perFox News.
The strongly worded document followed the White House's decision earlier this month to revamp its COVID.gov website. The updated site pushes the theory that COVID-19 leaked from the Wuhan Institute of Virology, describes it as the ""most likely"" origin, and criticises former US officials such as Dr Anthony Fauci and former President Joe Biden.
""A lab-related incident involving gain-of-function research is most likely the origin of COVID-19,"" reads the updated White House section. It also asserts that current oversight of such research is ""incomplete, severely convoluted, and lack[s] global applicability.""
The new US stance cites biological features in the virus that allegedly don't occur in nature and suggests that if a natural origin were true, evidence would have surfaced by now. The website also references a past lawsuit that resulted in a $24 billion judgment against China for allegedly hoarding protective gear and covering up the early outbreak, as perCNN.
Earlier this year, the CIA shifted its assessment, saying the pandemic most likely started in a lab, though the agency said it was ""low confidence"". In its conclusion, it said both lab and natural origins remain plausible.
An official from China's National Health Commission added that the next phase of COVID-19 origin tracing should focus on the US.

The sausage is also a way for aspiring leaders to show that they are humble enough to eat a cheap piece of meat wrapped in bread, and photographs of politicians eating these democracy sausages have become memes, and generally a part of Australian political folklore.

Moreover, the Australian constitution does not mention anything about a dress code for voting, and it has become a tradition to vote in swimwear. This started when the maker of ""Budgie Smuggler"" was giving out free swimming trunks to the first 200 people who voted in smugglers.

Voting in Australia for the national election began on Saturday. Per polls, voter appetite for change has been dampened by US tariffs, and hence the elections might favour Labour Prime Minister Anthony Albanese over conservative challenger Peter Dutton.

This follows a scandal where former adviser Mike Waltz included a journalist in a sensitive chat. Trump has since replaced Waltz.
Newly surfaced photographs from a recent Donald Trump cabinet meeting have raised eyebrows, revealing top White House officials using a modified, less secure version of the Signal messaging app, per a report by theGuardian.
The images, captured by Reuters, show Mike Waltz, the former national security adviser, using the TM SGNL app, which allows message retention and archiving. This development comes on the heels of a national security scandal last month, where Waltz accidentally included a journalist in a sensitive group chat discussing operational plans to bomb Yemen, which were then carried out the same way as described.
The TM SGNL app, created by TeleMessage, clones popular messaging apps with added archiving capabilities. According to 404 Media, this function may compromise the end-to-end encryption that makes Signal a trusted platform for private communications. It's likely that White House officials are using this modified app to comply with the legal requirement to preserve presidential records.
The photographs show Waltz exchanging messages with high-profile contacts, including Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, and Steve Witkoff, the president's special envoy to the Middle East. Some of the messages are visible, with one to Rubio reading ""there is time"" and a message from “Vance” stating, ""I have confirmation from my counterpart it's turned off. He is going to be here in …"". There's also an indication that Waltz used Signal to call Gabbard and had an 8am meeting scheduled for “PDB”, probably the president's daily brief.
In response to the controversy, a White House spokesperson defended the use of Signal, telling the Washington Post “As we have said many times, Signal is an approved app for government use and is loaded on government phones.” Meanwhile, Trump removed Waltz from his position as national security adviser on Thursday, replacing him with Rubio on an interim basis, and appointed Waltz as the UN ambassador.

Evidently, the images are of people or entities whose actions or viewpoints the US President Donald Trump and his administration disagree with.
Let's take a look at each of the four images:
1) Kamala Harris
The first photo features US Vice President Kamala Harris, with a text overlay that read, “Not President.”
The timing of this post is significant, coming shortly after Ms Harris' first major speech since losing the US Presidential elections in November 2024.
In her speech a couple of days ago, she criticised Donald Trump. She described the US President's economic policies, particularly his sweeping tariffs, as the catalyst for what she labelled the “greatest man-made economic crisis” in modern history, reportedCNN.
She also warned that Donald Trump's ongoing conflicts with the judiciary were pushing the nation towards a constitutional crisis.
2) Kilmar Abrego Garcia
The next image highlights Kilmar Abrego Garcia, with the text “Not a ‘Maryland Man'"".
Mr Garcia, a father of three, was living in Maryland when he was deported to El Salvador, a decision that has sparked controversy.
The Donald Trump administration said that Mr Garcia was a member of the violent MS-13 gang. Garcia's family and legal representatives dispute these accusations, maintaining that he is innocent with no criminal convictions in the US. He is currently being held in a prison, while his family continues to fight for his return.
3) NPR
The next image shows the NPR logo, with the text “Not real news"". This reference stems from President Donald Trump's executive order signed on May 1, which sought to reduce public subsidies for NPR.
Mr Trump accused the network of bias and propagating “radical, woke propaganda disguised as ‘news,'” reported news agencyReuters.
The executive order directed the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and other federal agencies to cease federal funding for NPR and PBS, as well as to eliminate indirect sources of taxpayer funding.
4) Gulf of Mexico
Thefinal imageshows a water body on a map, with the caption “Not Gulf of Mexico"". This section alludes to anexecutive orderissued by President Donald Trump on his first day in office to rename the Gulf of Mexico as the “Gulf of America.”
The order also declared February 9 as “Gulf of America Day"". This act was symbolic of Donald Trump's inclination to assert a more nationalistic and American-centric approach to geographical and cultural identities

The now-viral picture, which was also shared by the White House on X, was posted by Trump on his Truth Social page.
He can be seen sitting on the coronation chair.
While some social media users found the post funny, others were disappointed. A section of users felt that the post was disrespectful and accused Mr Trump of mocking the death of Pope Francis.

Please MAGA, explain to me how this ""man of faith"" isn't making a complete mockery of the pious.And the shame associated with the FUCKING WHITE HOUSE account re-tweeting this is just beyond the pale.
Calling Donald Trump's action “childish behaviour”, a person stated, “As President of the United States, posting a picture of himself as Pope a few days after the Pope's death is neither funny, nor does it present statesmanship and respectful behaviour. Rather, it shows the boundless arrogance and childish behaviour of a man who believes he is above everything, can get away with anything and is the head of everyone.""

South Carolina Senator Lindsay Graham stated on X, ""I was excited to hear that President Trump is open to the idea of being the next Pope.""

In an interview with theBBC, the Duke of Sussex said that he would ""love"" to repair the rift with his family, which he said had broken down over the security issue. ""There have been so many disagreements between myself and some of my family,"" Prince Harry said, but he added that he had now ""forgiven"" them.
""I would love reconciliation with my family. There's no point continuing to fight any more, life is precious,"" said Prince Harry, who said the dispute over his security had ""always been the sticking point,"" per theBBC.
""I don't know how much longer my father has,"" he added. ""He won't speak to me because of this security stuff, but it would be nice to reconcile.""
Notably, the British government downgraded the Duke's security in 2020 after he and Meghan stepped down as senior royals. On Friday, he lost a court case over his security arrangements.
Saying that he felt ""let down"", Harry described his court defeat as a ""good old-fashioned establishment stitch-up"". He also blamed the Royal Household for influencing the decision to reduce his security.
Speaking about the court ruling, Harry said, ""I'm devastated - not so much as devastated with the loss that I am about the people behind the decision, feeling as though this is okay."" He also stated that the decision to remove his security entitlement impacts him ""every single day"" and has left him in a position where he can only safely return to the UK if invited by the Royal Family, as he would get sufficient security in those circumstances.
""I can't see a world in which I would bring my wife and children back to the UK at this point,"" he told theBBCafter the court defeat.

Reacting to Prince Harry's interview, Buckingham Palace issued a rare statement. ""All of these issues have been examined repeatedly and meticulously by the courts, with the same conclusion reached on each occasion,"" the Royal Palace told the outlet.
On the other hand, the legal team behind the ruling said it would not be appropriate for Harry to have the publicly-paid-for security since shirking his royal duties.
Harry's wife Meghan Markle, and their children, Archie and Lilibet, have not been to the UK since the Prince left the Royal Family for Los Angeles in 2020.

The videos, which are just over two minutes long and are presented in Mandarin with Chinese subtitles, represent a major shift in the CIA's approach to hiring officials in China.
The US views China as its main military and strategic adversary.
One of the videos portrays the internal turmoil of a high-ranking Chinese Communist Party official. The video shows the official is haunted by the growing unpredictability of Chinese President Xi Jinping's sweeping anti-corruption drive.
“As I rise within the party, I watch those above me being discarded like worn-out shoes, but now I realise that my fate was just as precarious as theirs,” the narrator reflects, accompanied by visuals of surveillance and hushed anxiety.
The other video is about a young government employee disillusioned by the stark gap between the party's promises and the lived reality of common citizens. The protagonist toils through bureaucratic drudgery and late nights, only to return to a cramped apartment shared with his parents.
“From a young age, the party taught us that as long as we diligently followed the path laid out by our leaders, we would have a bright future,” the narrator laments.
Both narratives culminate with the characters reaching out to the CIA through its secure online platform — an invitation introduced by the agency last year through a simple text video. That previous effort provided step-by-step instructions in Chinese for contacting the agency. It formed part of a broader campaign to gather intelligence from hard-to-penetrate countries like China, Iran and North Korea.
Both videos can be found on YouTube and are titled in Chinese. One is called, “Why I contacted the CIA: to take control of my fate,” and the other is titled, “Why I contacted the CIA: for a better life.”
Watch the videos here:
These videos reflect a more aggressive push in CIA's outreach initiatives. It shows the agency's conviction that, in spite of strict internet regulations, its messaging is effectively reaching audiences within China.
“If it weren't working, we wouldn't be making more videos,”Reutersquoted a CIA official as saying.
The official said that the US was not just interested in counterintelligence, but was also seeking information on advanced science, military and cyber technology, valuable economic data, and China's foreign policy secrets.
China has not officially responded to the campaign.

The missile reportedly bypassed four layers of air defence and hit a grove adjacent to an access road within the airport's perimeter--one of the country's most sensitive zones-- creating a 25-meter deep crater.
Israel Defence Forces (IDF) said their several attempts to intercept the missile failed before it landed near the airport, sending a plume of smoke into the air. However, a direct hit on terminal infrastructure was averted, yet it caused panic among passengers in the terminal building.
At least eight people were injured in the attack, Magen David Adom (MDA), Israel's national emergency service, said.
The military released a video of the aftermath of the strike showing officers standing at the edge of a crater in an orchard, with the airport's control tower visible in the distance.

Yair Hezroni, the police's central district chief, can be heard saying in the video that ""you can see the area just behind us: a crater was formed here, several dozen metres (yards) wide and several dozen metres deep"".
Meanwhile, authorities have also launched a full-scale investigation into the breach of Israel's air defence and the missile's impact site near one of the country's most sensitive zones.

Israel has an elaborate system of air defences to counter missiles and drones. Known as Iron Dome, the system is designed to intercept short-range rockets, as well as shells and mortars, at ranges of between 4km and 70km from the missile launcher.
Following the missile strike, Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz issued a stark warning: ""Whoever harms us, we will strike them sevenfold.""
So far, Israel has refrained from launching retaliatory strikes on Yemen despite a series of Houthi attacks, as the United States leads a broader military campaign against the Iran-backed group.
Houthi leaders hailed the attack as a demonstration of their long-range strike capability.
Senior Houthi official Mohammed al-Bukhaiti told Al-Araby TV that his group has ""no red lines"" in its confrontation with Israel and emphasised their ability to hit sensitive Israeli targets, The Times of Israel reported.
Additionally, Houthi media chief Nasser al-Din Omar issued a warning to international airlines against flying to or from Israel, claiming such operations jeopardised aircraft safety.

Iran-backed Houthi rebels have claimed responsibility for the attack, saying it demonstrated their ability to strike sensitive targets in Israel.
The missile struck near Israel's biggest airport after multiple interception attempts by the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) failed, prompting a temporary halt in all takeoffs and landings at the country's main international airport. Around an hour after the strike, the Israel Airport Authority said the airspace was reopened and flight operations resumed.
Local media said though a direct hit on terminal infrastructure was averted, the missile impacted a grove adjacent to an access road within the airport's perimeter.

Nasser al-Din Omar, media head for the Houthis, also reportedly warned the airlines against operations in Israel, saying it endangers the safety of their aircraft.
Palestinian group Hamas also praised the 'precision' strike by Yemen's Huthis on the Israeli airport.
Israel Probing Incident
The Israeli Air Force's aerial defence units are now probing the reasons behind the unsuccessful interceptions of the missile fired by Houthis that breached Israel's air defence near one of the country's most sensitive zones.
Magen David Adom (MDA), Israel's national emergency service, reported that eight people were injured in the attack.
The Iran-backed Huthi rebels, who control swathes of Yemen, have launched missiles and drones targeting Israel and Red Sea shipping throughout the Gaza war, saying they are acting in solidarity with Palestinians. On Saturday, the Huthis claimed a third missile attack on Israel in two days.
The vast majority of missiles fired by the Huthis since the start of the Gaza war in 2023 have been intercepted by Israeli air defences. The Yemeni rebels had paused their attacks during a recent two-month ceasefire in the Gaza war.
But in March, they threatened to resume attacks on international shipping over Israel's aid blockade on the Gaza Strip.
The move triggered a response from the US military, which began hammering the rebels with near-daily air strikes starting March 15 in a bid to keep them from threatening shipping in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden. US strikes on the rebels began under former president Joe Biden, but intensified under his successor Donald Trump. Since March, the United States says it has struck more than 1,000 targets in Yemen.

Speaking in an interview with Russian broadcaster RT on Saturday, Muhammad Khalid Jamali, Pakistan's top diplomat in Moscow, said Islamabad has credible intelligence suggesting that India is planning military strikes on Pakistani territory. ""There are some other leaked documents whereby it has been decided to strike certain areas of Pakistan,"" Mr Jamali said. ""So that makes us feel that this is going to happen and it's imminent.""
The comments represent one of the most explicit threats of nuclear retaliation made by a senior Pakistani official against India in recent years. ""We in Pakistan will use the full spectrum of power, both conventional and nuclear,"" he said.
❗️NUCLEAR warning from Pakistan to IndiaDiplomat says Islamabad could use NUKES in case of war with New Delhi‘Pakistan will use full spectrum of power, BOTH conventional and nuclear' — ambassador to Russia tells RThttps://t.co/iTQWdWRQlZpic.twitter.com/LcQXKbIjD0
Mr Jamali's warning follows the April 22 terror attack in Jammu and Kashmir's Pahalgam, in which 26 people, mostly tourists, were killed. The incident has heightened tensions between the two nuclear-armed neighbours. India has accused Pakistan of harbouring and extending support to terror groups who orchestrated the attack, although Islamabad has denied involvement.
In retaliatory measures, India suspended the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT), a 1960 agreement brokered by the World Bank that governs the distribution of the Indus River and its tributaries between the two countries. This treaty had endured through multiple wars between India and Pakistan and was long viewed as a rare stabilising arrangement in a tense bilateral relationship.
Mr Jamali termed India's suspension of the treaty as an act of war.
""Any attempt to usurp the water of the lower riparian, or to stop it, or to divert it would be an act of war against Pakistan and would be responded to with full force of power, including full spectrum of power,"" he said.
The warning follows Pakistan's Defence Minister Khawaja Asif remark on Friday during an interview with Geo News, declaring that Islamabad would target any infrastructure India builds on the Indus River in violation of the treaty. ""Certainly, if they attempt to build any kind of structure, we will strike it,"" Mr Asif said. ""Aggression is not just about firing cannons or bullets; it has many faces. One of those faces is [blocking or diverting water], which could lead to deaths due to hunger and thirst,"" he added.
Amid talks of nuclear action, Pakistan's military conducted a test launch of the Abdali surface-to-surface missile on Saturday. The weapon has a range of 450 kilometres and is capable of carrying both conventional and nuclear payloads. According to a statement from the Pakistani army, the launch was intended to ensure ""operational readiness"".
The Indian government sees the test as a grave provocation, said sources. There has been no official statement from the Ministry of External Affairs on the test.
On Saturday, India imposed a ban on imports of goods originating in or transiting through Pakistan, and it prohibited Pakistani ships from entering Indian ports. This move was accompanied by instructions to Indian carriers not to call at Pakistani ports. Pakistan reciprocated within hours, announcing its own restrictions on Indian vessels.
The Directorate General of Shipping also issued a directive prohibiting maritime commerce between the two nations. The ban extends to all Pakistani goods, including those routed through third countries. Bilateral trade has been virtually frozen since 2019, when India imposed a 200 per cent tariff following the Pulwama attack.
Other measures announced in recent days include the suspension of postal exchanges, including parcels and letters sent via air or surface transport, and the closure of the Attari-Wagah land border crossing.

What Indian-Origin British Minister Said,"Sun, 04 May 2025 14:55:15 +0530","The United Kingdom is in talks with India to ensure shared access and benefit from historical artefacts like the Kohinoor diamond, said Lisa Nandy, Britain's Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport. The massive 105.6 carat stone--one of the largest cut diamonds in the world-- was held by rulers in India before landing in the hands of the East India Company from Maharaja Ranjit Singh's treasury and then being presented to Queen Victoria following the annexation of Punjab. It remains a symbol of British colonial loot and imperialism.
""We've been talking between the UK and India for quite some time about the way that we think we can collaborate much more closely together to make sure that people both in the UK and in India can benefit from and have access to many of the cultural artefacts that stem back to the very different era. This is something that I've discussed with my counterpart,"" Ms Nandy, who is in New Delhi on an official visit, told news agency ANI.

Stressing that the UK's relationship with India is ""very long"" and ""very deep"", she confirmed that her trip also marked the signing of a new cultural cooperation agreement between both nations.
""Across the creative industries, the UK and India really excel, whether it's film, fashion, TV, music, gaming. We're really good at these things, and we export many of those products to the world, but we know that through cooperation, we can do more and we can achieve more together. Our Science museums group has been working with the National Museum Science Museums group here to get joint collaborations, joint exhibitions, tour different objects, make sure that people in India and the UK can really benefit from that. We think that's the model for how we can cooperate much more closely across all the other creative industries as well,"" she said.
The British minister also met Foreign Minister S Jaishankar during her India visit. Talking about her meeting, she said, ""We were very pleased to have a bilateral meeting to discuss how we can cooperate much more closely.""
""Prime Minister Modi has signalled his personal commitment to taking what is already a huge Indian success story through film, fashion, and their wider creative industries and really putting rocket boosters under them for the coming years. Our Prime Minister, Sir Keir Starmer, very much agrees with him. That is exactly what the UK government is trying to do, and we have a lot of ambition for what India and the UK can achieve together,' she added.
She also condoled the terror attack in Jammu and Kashmir's Pahalgam and said the United Kingdom stands with the people of India against terrorism.
""Our Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, was very pleased to be able to send his condolences directly to Prime Minister Modi and to send our condolences to the families of the victims of these appalling attacks. The UK stands with India against terrorism, always in whatever form. We know the Indian nation is hurting because of those attacks, and our relationship with India is very long and very deep,"" Ms Nandy said
"" When you're hurting, we're hurting, and I was pleased to be able to join in that minute's silence to show our respect and our support for India's fight against terrorism,"" she added.

His Labor Party dealt a crushing defeat to its conservative opposition, which was thrown into further disarray when leader Peter Dutton lost a seat he has held for 24 years.
Here are five takeaways from Saturday's vote.
US President Donald Trump's trade tariffs, and the chaos they unleashed, may not have been the biggest factor in the Labor Party victory -- but they helped.
Dutton vowed to slash the civil service, clamp down on immigration, and said he would not stand before an Aboriginal flag.
The harshest critics likened Dutton's offering to that of a ""Temu Trump"", an unflattering reference to the popular website offering cut-price unbranded goods.
""If we want to understand why a good chunk of the electorate has changed across the election campaign over the last couple of months, I think that's the biggest thing,"" said Henry Maher, a politics lecturer at the University of Sydney.
From South Africa to the United States, voters have in recent times turfed out a string of established governments in a global backlash dubbed the ""incumbency curse"".
With inflation biting, and populist parties seemingly on the rise elsewhere, many wondered whether Albanese's government would meet a similar fate.
Instead, Australians rewarded his steady-as-she-goes leadership style, choosing political stability in a time of global upheaval.
Dutton's US$200 billion promise to introduce atomic power to Australia for the first time has imploded.
The opposition leader was hounded on the campaign trail for not visiting any of the seven sites where he proposed to build industrial-scale nuclear reactors.
His nuclear dream included ramping up gas production, slowing the rollout of solar and wind projects, and ditching the clean energy goals set by Albanese's centre-left government.
""This was an energy referendum. Nuclear bombed at the ballot with Australians dubbing it toxic,"" said Amanda McKenzie, chief executive of clean energy advocate the Climate Council.
Dutton's Liberal-National coalition crashed to one of its worst-ever defeats, losing a string of seats once considered conservative strongholds.
With Dutton turfed from his own seat of Dickson -- an electorate he has held for 24 years -- the coalition will lick its wounds with no leader in place.
Notably, Dutton's opposition failed to win back a string of seats claimed by the so-called ""teal"" movement in 2022.
The teals -- a loose-knit group of political novices pushing for climate action -- held on to their inner-city seats despite a targeted conservative campaign.
Most opinion polls picked the winner -- but few hinted at the scale of the Labor landslide.
""This was beyond even our most optimistic expectations. It was a history-making night. It was one for the ages,"" Treasurer Jim Chalmers said Sunday.
Most polls pointed towards a Labor government -- but were split on whether Albanese would command a slim majority, or cobble together a coalition.
Instead, Labor is on course to win at least 82 seats in the 150-member parliament, partial results showed, easily ahead of the 76 needed for majority rule.

Prime Minister Lawrence Wong's People's Action Party (PAP) won the Singapore General Election Saturday by a landslide, securing 87 of the 97 parliamentary seats, local media reported.
Mr Wong and the PAP had sought a new mandate from the general election in the midst of uncertainties to the global economy caused by the US trade tariffs.
The PAP, Singapore's oldest and largest political party, has ruled the city-state ever since independence in 1965.
About 2.6 million Singaporeans were eligible to vote on Saturday for 92 contested seats as the PAP's Group Representation Constituency for Marine Parade-Braddell Heights had a walkover on nomination day on April 23.
This was Mr Wong's first election as prime minister of the global-business focused Singapore which now faces navigating through strong headwinds caused by tariffs imposed by US President Donald Trump.
Speaking after the result for Marsiling-Yew Tee Group Representation Constituency (GRC) was announced, Wong said the election was his first and a “humbling experience”. He pledged to work hard for the voters.
“We are grateful for your strong mandate and… will honour the trust that you have given to us by working even harder for all of you,” said the 52-year-old premier.
The Elections Department (ELD) said Singaporeans cast their votes for 92 out of 97 parliamentary seats at 1,240 polling stations island-wide to decide the future politics of Singapore.
This was Singapore's 19th election since the first general election in 1948 and 14th since its Independence in 1965.
Mr Wong, 52, was sworn-in last May as the new prime minister in 20 years after Lee Hsien Loong stepped down after almost two decades.
There was vociferous campaigning by opposition political parties, raising issues related to high cost of living and housing as well as increasing presence of foreigners in almost all sectors of the economy in the manpower-short Singapore.
Top PAP leaders were seen balancing their election schedules during the last nine days of campaigning since nominations closed on April 23 along with negotiating tariffs imposed by Singapore's largest trading partner US.
Singapore's Deputy Prime Minister and Trade and Industry Minister Gan Kim Yong had been negotiating with his US counterparts on a 10 per cent tariff imposed on imports from Singapore.
The PAP fielded candidates in all 92 constituencies, while its main rival, the Workers' Party (WP), contested 26 seats in eight constituencies.
The Progress Singapore Party (PSP) fielded 13 candidates across six constituencies. Other parties in the fray included the Singapore People's Party (SPP), Singapore Democratic Party (SDP), People's Power Party (PPP), People's Alliance for Reform (PAR), Red Dot United (RDU), National Solidarity Party (NSP), Singapore United Party (SUP), and Singapore Democratic Alliance (SDA).
Prime Minister Wong had urged Singaporeans to vote responsibly as the global economies are going through unprecedented challenges and led to uncertainties.
The finance-trade-export focused city state sits in the middle of US-China trade war, having historical bilateral economic and diplomatic relations with both the giant markets, diplomatic sources said.
Manufacturing activity in Singapore fell into recession territory in April 2025 as tariffs announced by US President Donald Trump triggered a wave of export-order deferments and cancellations.
The purchasing managers' index (PMI), a barometer of the manufacturing sector's health, fell to 49.6 points in April, down one point from 50.6 in March; readings above 50 indicate growth while those below point to contraction.
“The contraction in Singapore's factory activity snaps 19 straight months of expansion,” reported The Straits Times, citing a Singapore Institute of Purchasing and Materials Management (SIPMM) report on Friday.
Meanwhile, the PAP had a walkover in one constituency of five members of parliament at the close of nomination day on April 23.
The PAP's share of the popular vote slipped to a near-record low of 61 per cent in 2020 elections, down from nearly 70 per cent in 2015 and although it kept 83 out of 93 parliamentary seats, the opposition gained ground with a record 10 seats. PTI GS OZ SCY NPK GSP GSP

The video, titled ""Lo-fi MAGA Video to Relax/Study To,"" was streamed live across the Trump administration's official YouTube and X channels.
Lo-Fi MAGA Video to Relax/Study To ????????Have a great weekend!https://t.co/IrKPU2i4i7
The video features calming, low-fidelity beats commonly used for background study or work music. Accompanying the audio was an animation of Trump at the Resolute Desk signing documents, alongside a continuous scroll of text highlighting key campaign promises and actions labelled ""Promises made, promises kept.""
The text scroll listed several of the administration's recent actions, including executive orders aimed at eliminating diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programs in the military and policies targeting birthright citizenship for children of undocumented immigrants.
According to a White House official the 15-minute clip will loop throughout the weekend across digital platforms to explore ""innovative ways to distribute fact sheets and other information.""
The video wraps up a week-long campaign by the White House to spotlight what it says are Trump's key achievements in the first 100 days of his second term. Among the highlights were a newly launched ""White House Wire"" section on the official website modelled after the conservative Drudge Report, a round of ""new media"" briefings led by press secretary Karoline Leavitt, and over 100 interviews granted to conservative influencers and podcasters.
This media push came during a rough week for the administration, marked by the ouster of National Security Adviser Mike Waltz following the ""Signalgate"" scandal, as perUS media.
The controversy erupted when Waltz took full responsibility for inadvertently adding journalist Jeffrey Goldberg to aSignal group chatdiscussing classified military operations in Yemen.
In his first 100 days of his second term, Donald Trump took swift and controversial actions.
He declared a national emergency at the southern border, deployed troops, ended birthright citizenship for undocumented immigrants, and signed the Laken Riley Act to crack down on undocumented crime.
He issued executive orders to dismantle DEI programmes, withdraw from the World Health Organization, and declassify JFK assassination files. Trump also reintroduced tariffs on China, Canada, and Mexico, leading to trade tensions, and cut funding to the US cybersecurity agency (CISA).
He pardoned over 1,500 people tied to the January 6 Capitol attack and Ross Ulbricht, the Silk Road founder. He appointed Elon Musk to lead a new Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) and rolled back federal regulations.

However, the situation quickly turned deadly.
A fully-grown female crocodile, named Lalay, charged towards the man, sinking her fangs deep into his arm. Horrified onlookers screamed as the crocodile clamped her jaws around his arm, and then grabbed his thigh, attempting a deadly death roll to tear him apart.
The gruesome attack lasted for 30 minutes, with the tourist trapped in the enclosure. Lalay's handler eventually intervened, using a piece of cement to bash the crocodile on the head, causing her to loosen her grip and freeing the victim. Medics quickly wrapped the visitor's arm and thigh with cloth to control the bleeding before rushing him to the hospital for further treatment. He received more than 50 stitches.
Police officers told local media that the man had climbed into the enclosure because he thought the crocodile was fake.
""The tourist was walking around the area, then he saw the crocodile, which he thought was just a plastic fixture. He climbed the fence and entered the enclosure, and the crocodile attacked him. This kind of behaviour is very dangerous. Nobody should ever enter an animal's enclosure at the zoo. He put other people's lives at risk, and he is very lucky to have survived,"" Police Staff Sergeant Joel Sajolga of the Siay Municipal Police told multiple outlets, per TheDaily Mail.
An investigation into the incident is still ongoing.

The devastated mother, Jeanette Dees, and the relatives of convicted murderer Te'Bryis Robinson, 19, got into an altercation inside the Sedgwick County Courthouse on April 8, KWCH reported.
The altercation started after Ms Dee urged the judge to impose the ""maximum possible sentence"" on her son's killer during her court appearance.
She also insulted Robison and his friends and family present in the courtroom.
The mother's remarks before the sentencing created an uproar in the courtroom, resulting in insults exchanged before the first blow was delivered.
A member of Ms Dees' family was seen getting up from his seat and punching one of Robinson's relatives in the face.
This led to a brawl between the two families in the centre of the courtroom.
The District Attorney's office charged Ms Dees with one count of disorderly conduct and a $500 fine, the Sedgwick County Sheriff's Office confirmed.
Others who have been charged with disorderly conduct were Trerntasia Hutton, Derrick Parker, Trentavies Hutton, Trentez Hutton, and a 16-year-old boy.
Before the sentence was delivered, several people were expelled from the courtroom. The judge sentenced Robinson to 21 years and three months in jail for the murder of TrenJ'vious ""Tubby"" Hutton.
In another incident from February, the uncle and stepfather of the accused assaulted a New Mexico murder suspect, Alexander Ortiz, 21, in court.
Ortiz was arrested by Albuquerque police for shooting Alianna Farfan, his ex-girlfriend.
Courtroom video footage showed a man jumping over the barricade separating the public in the courtroom and charging at Ortiz as he tried to escape. Another man followed a few moments later.
A frenzied altercation broke out, with Carlos Lucero, Pete Ysasi, Ortiz, Ortiz's father, a correctional officer, and an anonymous sixth man all grappling on the ground.
Lucero and Ysasi were seen punching a man wearing pants and a dark long-sleeved shirt while the prison guard tried to protect Ortiz.

For the past seven years, Abel has been overseeing Berkshire's BNSF railroad and its treat makers, See's Candies and Dairy Queen, along with dozens of other manufacturing and retail businesses that Buffett acquired over the years.
He grew up in Canada as a hockey player and learned the value of hard work as he redeemed discarded bottles and worked for a small company filling fire extinguishers. Now he finds himself at the top of the food chain in the investment world.
Read:Warren Buffett To Step Down, Greg Abel To Be New Berkshire Hathaway CEO
Berkshire confirmed Abel as Buffett's successor in 2021 after former Vice Chairman Charlie Munger let it slip at the annual meeting. Since then, Abel has largely remained in Buffett's shadow, although shareholders have had a chance to get to know him a bit when he appeared alongside Buffett at the annual meetings and in interviews.
Berkshire's board will now vote on whether to formally approve Abel as the new CEO to take over at the end of 2025. At the annual meeting in Omaha, Buffett said he expects that to occur by a unanimous vote.
Abel will step forward to take responsibility for all of Berkshire's eclectic assortment of businesses with their nearly 400,000 employees and the conglomerate's massive stock portfolio. Buffett and members of Berkshire's board, who for years have devoted much of their time to finding Buffett's successor, have praised Abel's brilliance and knack for understanding all kinds of businesses.
Buffett once said Berkshire is ""so damn lucky"" to have Abel ready to take over, but he will have trouble coming close to Buffett's remarkable track record of outpacing the market. Whereas Buffett grew Berkshire over the decades by making well-timed deals and stock investments at attractive prices, Berkshire's massive size has made it that much harder lately to find anything big enough to change the conglomerate's bottom line.
Read:Warren Buffett's Best And Worst Investments In Last 60 Years
Abel has big shoes to fill, but no one expects him to match the accomplishments of Buffett, who made him a billionaire many times over and one of the wealthiest investors of the past century. Longtime Berkshire board member Ron Olson said two days before the announcement that he believed Abel was ready to take over.
""Is he another Warren Buffett? No, there is no other Warren Buffett that I know. But he has so many of the fundamentals of Warren,"" Olson said. ""He is for sure high integrity. He is a hard worker. He is a strategic thinker.""
Buffett has said for years that Abel's main job when he becomes CEO will be to preserve Berkshire's unique decentralised culture built on independence, integrity, and trust. In fact, Munger's comment that gave away Abel's future role was that ""Greg will keep the culture.""
Executives at a diverse mix of Berkshire subsidiaries, including sneaker maker Brooks Running, flooring giant Shaw and Borsheims jewelry, have said they all turn to Abel whenever they face tough questions in their businesses related to strategy or operating details, and he's always available when they need him, though he will challenge them.
Read:""Won't Bet On A Currency Going To Hell"": Warren Buffett's Dollar Warning
""When I think about Greg, he not only has high business acumen, but he has really high business instincts,"" Dairy Queen CEO Troy Bader said Friday. ""The intuition is really important. And, you know, Warren has that intuition, but Greg has a lot of it as well.""
Abel has never done many interviews, though he put his detailed business knowledge on display at the Berkshire meetings when discussing utilities and the railroad. But he did offer a glimpse into his background to the Horatio Alger Association when that group honoured him in 2018.
Abel's family-oriented upbringing in Edmonton, Alberta, and lessons in hard work and perseverance were similar to what Buffett learned while working in his grandfather's Omaha grocery store as a kid.
""I think hard work leads to good outcomes. In my schooling, in sports, and in my business positions, I learned that if I put in a lot of work and was well-prepared, then success would be more likely,"" Abel said in 2018.
Abel lives about two hours from Buffett's hometown in Des Moines, Iowa, where he has led Berkshire Hathaway Energy since 2011 and helped coach his kids' hockey and soccer teams. He is expected to continue living there because Berkshire is so decentralised that there is little reason to move to its Omaha headquarters. Buffett only had a couple of dozen people working in his office as he spent his days reading business reports and making the occasional phone call.

The missile reportedly bypassed four layers of air defence and hit a grove adjacent to an access road within the airport's perimeter--one of the country's most sensitive zones-- creating a 25-meter deep crater.
Israel Defence Forces (IDF) said their several attempts to intercept the missile failed before it landed near the airport, sending a plume of smoke into the air. However, a direct hit on terminal infrastructure was averted, yet it caused panic among passengers in the terminal building.
At least eight people were injured in the attack, Magen David Adom (MDA), Israel's national emergency service, said.
The military released a video of the aftermath of the strike showing officers standing at the edge of a crater in an orchard, with the airport's control tower visible in the distance.

Yair Hezroni, the police's central district chief, can be heard saying in the video that ""you can see the area just behind us: a crater was formed here, several dozen metres (yards) wide and several dozen metres deep"".
Meanwhile, authorities have also launched a full-scale investigation into the breach of Israel's air defence and the missile's impact site near one of the country's most sensitive zones.
The Houthi missile hit just 75 meters from Terminal 3 at Ben Gurion Airport, narrowly avoiding a direct strike that could have triggered a full-scale war.This needs a powerful response.pic.twitter.com/ySGvEmnshN
Israel has an elaborate system of air defences to counter missiles and drones. Known as Iron Dome, the system is designed to intercept short-range rockets, as well as shells and mortars, at ranges of between 4km and 70km from the missile launcher.
Following the missile strike, Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz issued a stark warning: ""Whoever harms us, we will strike them sevenfold.""
So far, Israel has refrained from launching retaliatory strikes on Yemen despite a series of Houthi attacks, as the United States leads a broader military campaign against the Iran-backed group.
Houthi leaders hailed the attack as a demonstration of their long-range strike capability.
Senior Houthi official Mohammed al-Bukhaiti told Al-Araby TV that his group has ""no red lines"" in its confrontation with Israel and emphasised their ability to hit sensitive Israeli targets, The Times of Israel reported.
Additionally, Houthi media chief Nasser al-Din Omar issued a warning to international airlines against flying to or from Israel, claiming such operations jeopardised aircraft safety.

Iran-backed Houthi rebels have claimed responsibility for the attack, saying it demonstrated their ability to strike sensitive targets in Israel.
The missile struck near Israel's biggest airport after multiple interception attempts by the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) failed, prompting a temporary halt in all takeoffs and landings at the country's main international airport. Around an hour after the strike, the Israel Airport Authority said the airspace was reopened and flight operations resumed.
Local media said though a direct hit on terminal infrastructure was averted, the missile impacted a grove adjacent to an access road within the airport's perimeter.
Following the strike, Israel's Defence Minister, Israel Katz, in a terse statement, said, ""Whoever harms us, we will strike them sevenfold.""
So far, Israel has refrained from launching retaliatory strikes on Yemen despite a series of Houthi attacks, as the United States leads a broader military campaign against the Iran-backed group.

Nasser al-Din Omar, media head for the Houthis, also reportedly warned the airlines against operations in Israel, saying it endangers the safety of their aircraft.
Palestinian group Hamas also praised the 'precision' strike by Yemen's Huthis on the Israeli airport.
Israel Probing Incident
The Israeli Air Force's aerial defence units are now probing the reasons behind the unsuccessful interceptions of the missile fired by Houthis that breached Israel's air defence near one of the country's most sensitive zones.
Magen David Adom (MDA), Israel's national emergency service, reported that eight people were injured in the attack.
The Iran-backed Huthi rebels, who control swathes of Yemen, have launched missiles and drones targeting Israel and Red Sea shipping throughout the Gaza war, saying they are acting in solidarity with Palestinians. On Saturday, the Huthis claimed a third missile attack on Israel in two days.
The vast majority of missiles fired by the Huthis since the start of the Gaza war in 2023 have been intercepted by Israeli air defences. The Yemeni rebels had paused their attacks during a recent two-month ceasefire in the Gaza war.
But in March, they threatened to resume attacks on international shipping over Israel's aid blockade on the Gaza Strip.
The move triggered a response from the US military, which began hammering the rebels with near-daily air strikes starting March 15 in a bid to keep them from threatening shipping in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden. US strikes on the rebels began under former president Joe Biden, but intensified under his successor Donald Trump. Since March, the United States says it has struck more than 1,000 targets in Yemen.

Speaking in an interview with Russian broadcaster RT on Saturday, Muhammad Khalid Jamali, Pakistan's top diplomat in Moscow, said Islamabad has credible intelligence suggesting that India is planning military strikes on Pakistani territory. ""There are some other leaked documents whereby it has been decided to strike certain areas of Pakistan,"" Mr Jamali said. ""So that makes us feel that this is going to happen and it's imminent.""
The comments represent one of the most explicit threats of nuclear retaliation made by a senior Pakistani official against India in recent years. ""We in Pakistan will use the full spectrum of power, both conventional and nuclear,"" he said.
❗️NUCLEAR warning from Pakistan to IndiaDiplomat says Islamabad could use NUKES in case of war with New Delhi‘Pakistan will use full spectrum of power, BOTH conventional and nuclear' — ambassador to Russia tells RThttps://t.co/iTQWdWRQlZpic.twitter.com/LcQXKbIjD0
Mr Jamali's warning follows the April 22 terror attack in Jammu and Kashmir's Pahalgam, in which 26 people, mostly tourists, were killed. The incident has heightened tensions between the two nuclear-armed neighbours. India has accused Pakistan of harbouring and extending support to terror groups who orchestrated the attack, although Islamabad has denied involvement.
In retaliatory measures, India suspended the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT), a 1960 agreement brokered by the World Bank that governs the distribution of the Indus River and its tributaries between the two countries. This treaty had endured through multiple wars between India and Pakistan and was long viewed as a rare stabilising arrangement in a tense bilateral relationship.
Mr Jamali termed India's suspension of the treaty as an act of war.
""Any attempt to usurp the water of the lower riparian, or to stop it, or to divert it would be an act of war against Pakistan and would be responded to with full force of power, including full spectrum of power,"" he said.
The warning follows Pakistan's Defence Minister Khawaja Asif remark on Friday during an interview with Geo News, declaring that Islamabad would target any infrastructure India builds on the Indus River in violation of the treaty. ""Certainly, if they attempt to build any kind of structure, we will strike it,"" Mr Asif said. ""Aggression is not just about firing cannons or bullets; it has many faces. One of those faces is [blocking or diverting water], which could lead to deaths due to hunger and thirst,"" he added.
Amid talks of nuclear action, Pakistan's military conducted a test launch of the Abdali surface-to-surface missile on Saturday. The weapon has a range of 450 kilometres and is capable of carrying both conventional and nuclear payloads. According to a statement from the Pakistani army, the launch was intended to ensure ""operational readiness"".
The Indian government sees the test as a grave provocation, said sources. There has been no official statement from the Ministry of External Affairs on the test.
On Saturday, India imposed a ban on imports of goods originating in or transiting through Pakistan, and it prohibited Pakistani ships from entering Indian ports. This move was accompanied by instructions to Indian carriers not to call at Pakistani ports. Pakistan reciprocated within hours, announcing its own restrictions on Indian vessels.
The Directorate General of Shipping also issued a directive prohibiting maritime commerce between the two nations. The ban extends to all Pakistani goods, including those routed through third countries. Bilateral trade has been virtually frozen since 2019, when India imposed a 200 per cent tariff following the Pulwama attack.
Other measures announced in recent days include the suspension of postal exchanges, including parcels and letters sent via air or surface transport, and the closure of the Attari-Wagah land border crossing.

The massive 105.6 carat stone--one of the largest cut diamonds in the world-- was held by rulers in India before landing in the hands of the East India Company from Maharaja Ranjit Singh's treasury and then being presented to Queen Victoria following the annexation of Punjab. It remains a symbol of British colonial loot and imperialism.
""We've been talking between the UK and India for quite some time about the way that we think we can collaborate much more closely together to make sure that people both in the UK and in India can benefit from and have access to many of the cultural artefacts that stem back to the very different era. This is something that I've discussed with my counterpart,"" Ms Nandy, who is in New Delhi on an official visit, told news agency ANI.

Stressing that the UK's relationship with India is ""very long"" and ""very deep"", she confirmed that her trip also marked the signing of a new cultural cooperation agreement between both nations.
""Across the creative industries, the UK and India really excel, whether it's film, fashion, TV, music, gaming. We're really good at these things, and we export many of those products to the world, but we know that through cooperation, we can do more and we can achieve more together. Our Science museums group has been working with the National Museum Science Museums group here to get joint collaborations, joint exhibitions, tour different objects, make sure that people in India and the UK can really benefit from that. We think that's the model for how we can cooperate much more closely across all the other creative industries as well,"" she said.
The British minister also met Foreign Minister S Jaishankar during her India visit. Talking about her meeting, she said, ""We were very pleased to have a bilateral meeting to discuss how we can cooperate much more closely.""
""Prime Minister Modi has signalled his personal commitment to taking what is already a huge Indian success story through film, fashion, and their wider creative industries and really putting rocket boosters under them for the coming years. Our Prime Minister, Sir Keir Starmer, very much agrees with him. That is exactly what the UK government is trying to do, and we have a lot of ambition for what India and the UK can achieve together,' she added.
She also condoled the terror attack in Jammu and Kashmir's Pahalgam and said the United Kingdom stands with the people of India against terrorism.
""Our Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, was very pleased to be able to send his condolences directly to Prime Minister Modi and to send our condolences to the families of the victims of these appalling attacks. The UK stands with India against terrorism, always in whatever form. We know the Indian nation is hurting because of those attacks, and our relationship with India is very long and very deep,"" Ms Nandy said
"" When you're hurting, we're hurting, and I was pleased to be able to join in that minute's silence to show our respect and our support for India's fight against terrorism,"" she added.

His Labor Party dealt a crushing defeat to its conservative opposition, which was thrown into further disarray when leader Peter Dutton lost a seat he has held for 24 years.
Here are five takeaways from Saturday's vote.
US President Donald Trump's trade tariffs, and the chaos they unleashed, may not have been the biggest factor in the Labor Party victory -- but they helped.
Dutton vowed to slash the civil service, clamp down on immigration, and said he would not stand before an Aboriginal flag.
The harshest critics likened Dutton's offering to that of a ""Temu Trump"", an unflattering reference to the popular website offering cut-price unbranded goods.
""If we want to understand why a good chunk of the electorate has changed across the election campaign over the last couple of months, I think that's the biggest thing,"" said Henry Maher, a politics lecturer at the University of Sydney.
From South Africa to the United States, voters have in recent times turfed out a string of established governments in a global backlash dubbed the ""incumbency curse"".
With inflation biting, and populist parties seemingly on the rise elsewhere, many wondered whether Albanese's government would meet a similar fate.
Instead, Australians rewarded his steady-as-she-goes leadership style, choosing political stability in a time of global upheaval.
Dutton's US$200 billion promise to introduce atomic power to Australia for the first time has imploded.
The opposition leader was hounded on the campaign trail for not visiting any of the seven sites where he proposed to build industrial-scale nuclear reactors.
His nuclear dream included ramping up gas production, slowing the rollout of solar and wind projects, and ditching the clean energy goals set by Albanese's centre-left government.
""This was an energy referendum. Nuclear bombed at the ballot with Australians dubbing it toxic,"" said Amanda McKenzie, chief executive of clean energy advocate the Climate Council.
Dutton's Liberal-National coalition crashed to one of its worst-ever defeats, losing a string of seats once considered conservative strongholds.
With Dutton turfed from his own seat of Dickson -- an electorate he has held for 24 years -- the coalition will lick its wounds with no leader in place.
Notably, Dutton's opposition failed to win back a string of seats claimed by the so-called ""teal"" movement in 2022.
The teals -- a loose-knit group of political novices pushing for climate action -- held on to their inner-city seats despite a targeted conservative campaign.
Most opinion polls picked the winner -- but few hinted at the scale of the Labor landslide.
""This was beyond even our most optimistic expectations. It was a history-making night. It was one for the ages,"" Treasurer Jim Chalmers said Sunday.
Most polls pointed towards a Labor government -- but were split on whether Albanese would command a slim majority, or cobble together a coalition.
Instead, Labor is on course to win at least 82 seats in the 150-member parliament, partial results showed, easily ahead of the 76 needed for majority rule.

Prime Minister Lawrence Wong's People's Action Party (PAP) won the Singapore General Election Saturday by a landslide, securing 87 of the 97 parliamentary seats, local media reported.
Mr Wong and the PAP had sought a new mandate from the general election in the midst of uncertainties to the global economy caused by the US trade tariffs.
The PAP, Singapore's oldest and largest political party, has ruled the city-state ever since independence in 1965.
About 2.6 million Singaporeans were eligible to vote on Saturday for 92 contested seats as the PAP's Group Representation Constituency for Marine Parade-Braddell Heights had a walkover on nomination day on April 23.
This was Mr Wong's first election as prime minister of the global-business focused Singapore which now faces navigating through strong headwinds caused by tariffs imposed by US President Donald Trump.
Speaking after the result for Marsiling-Yew Tee Group Representation Constituency (GRC) was announced, Wong said the election was his first and a “humbling experience”. He pledged to work hard for the voters.
“We are grateful for your strong mandate and… will honour the trust that you have given to us by working even harder for all of you,” said the 52-year-old premier.
The Elections Department (ELD) said Singaporeans cast their votes for 92 out of 97 parliamentary seats at 1,240 polling stations island-wide to decide the future politics of Singapore.
This was Singapore's 19th election since the first general election in 1948 and 14th since its Independence in 1965.
Mr Wong, 52, was sworn-in last May as the new prime minister in 20 years after Lee Hsien Loong stepped down after almost two decades.
There was vociferous campaigning by opposition political parties, raising issues related to high cost of living and housing as well as increasing presence of foreigners in almost all sectors of the economy in the manpower-short Singapore.
Top PAP leaders were seen balancing their election schedules during the last nine days of campaigning since nominations closed on April 23 along with negotiating tariffs imposed by Singapore's largest trading partner US.
Singapore's Deputy Prime Minister and Trade and Industry Minister Gan Kim Yong had been negotiating with his US counterparts on a 10 per cent tariff imposed on imports from Singapore.
The PAP fielded candidates in all 92 constituencies, while its main rival, the Workers' Party (WP), contested 26 seats in eight constituencies.
The Progress Singapore Party (PSP) fielded 13 candidates across six constituencies. Other parties in the fray included the Singapore People's Party (SPP), Singapore Democratic Party (SDP), People's Power Party (PPP), People's Alliance for Reform (PAR), Red Dot United (RDU), National Solidarity Party (NSP), Singapore United Party (SUP), and Singapore Democratic Alliance (SDA).
Prime Minister Wong had urged Singaporeans to vote responsibly as the global economies are going through unprecedented challenges and led to uncertainties.
The finance-trade-export focused city state sits in the middle of US-China trade war, having historical bilateral economic and diplomatic relations with both the giant markets, diplomatic sources said.
Manufacturing activity in Singapore fell into recession territory in April 2025 as tariffs announced by US President Donald Trump triggered a wave of export-order deferments and cancellations.
The purchasing managers' index (PMI), a barometer of the manufacturing sector's health, fell to 49.6 points in April, down one point from 50.6 in March; readings above 50 indicate growth while those below point to contraction.
“The contraction in Singapore's factory activity snaps 19 straight months of expansion,” reported The Straits Times, citing a Singapore Institute of Purchasing and Materials Management (SIPMM) report on Friday.
Meanwhile, the PAP had a walkover in one constituency of five members of parliament at the close of nomination day on April 23.
The PAP's share of the popular vote slipped to a near-record low of 61 per cent in 2020 elections, down from nearly 70 per cent in 2015 and although it kept 83 out of 93 parliamentary seats, the opposition gained ground with a record 10 seats. PTI GS OZ SCY NPK GSP GSP

The video, titled ""Lo-fi MAGA Video to Relax/Study To,"" was streamed live across the Trump administration's official YouTube and X channels.
Lo-Fi MAGA Video to Relax/Study To ????????Have a great weekend!https://t.co/IrKPU2i4i7
The video features calming, low-fidelity beats commonly used for background study or work music. Accompanying the audio was an animation of Trump at the Resolute Desk signing documents, alongside a continuous scroll of text highlighting key campaign promises and actions labelled ""Promises made, promises kept.""
The text scroll listed several of the administration's recent actions, including executive orders aimed at eliminating diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programs in the military and policies targeting birthright citizenship for children of undocumented immigrants.
According to a White House official the 15-minute clip will loop throughout the weekend across digital platforms to explore ""innovative ways to distribute fact sheets and other information.""
The video wraps up a week-long campaign by the White House to spotlight what it says are Trump's key achievements in the first 100 days of his second term. Among the highlights were a newly launched ""White House Wire"" section on the official website modelled after the conservative Drudge Report, a round of ""new media"" briefings led by press secretary Karoline Leavitt, and over 100 interviews granted to conservative influencers and podcasters.
This media push came during a rough week for the administration, marked by the ouster of National Security Adviser Mike Waltz following the ""Signalgate"" scandal, as perUS media.
The controversy erupted when Waltz took full responsibility for inadvertently adding journalist Jeffrey Goldberg to aSignal group chatdiscussing classified military operations in Yemen.
In his first 100 days of his second term, Donald Trump took swift and controversial actions.
He declared a national emergency at the southern border, deployed troops, ended birthright citizenship for undocumented immigrants, and signed the Laken Riley Act to crack down on undocumented crime.
He issued executive orders to dismantle DEI programmes, withdraw from the World Health Organization, and declassify JFK assassination files. Trump also reintroduced tariffs on China, Canada, and Mexico, leading to trade tensions, and cut funding to the US cybersecurity agency (CISA).
He pardoned over 1,500 people tied to the January 6 Capitol attack and Ross Ulbricht, the Silk Road founder. He appointed Elon Musk to lead a new Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) and rolled back federal regulations.

However, the situation quickly turned deadly.
A fully-grown female crocodile, named Lalay, charged towards the man, sinking her fangs deep into his arm. Horrified onlookers screamed as the crocodile clamped her jaws around his arm, and then grabbed his thigh, attempting a deadly death roll to tear him apart.
The gruesome attack lasted for 30 minutes, with the tourist trapped in the enclosure. Lalay's handler eventually intervened, using a piece of cement to bash the crocodile on the head, causing her to loosen her grip and freeing the victim. Medics quickly wrapped the visitor's arm and thigh with cloth to control the bleeding before rushing him to the hospital for further treatment. He received more than 50 stitches.
Police officers told local media that the man had climbed into the enclosure because he thought the crocodile was fake.
""The tourist was walking around the area, then he saw the crocodile, which he thought was just a plastic fixture. He climbed the fence and entered the enclosure, and the crocodile attacked him. This kind of behaviour is very dangerous. Nobody should ever enter an animal's enclosure at the zoo. He put other people's lives at risk, and he is very lucky to have survived,"" Police Staff Sergeant Joel Sajolga of the Siay Municipal Police told multiple outlets, per TheDaily Mail.
An investigation into the incident is still ongoing.

The devastated mother, Jeanette Dees, and the relatives of convicted murderer Te'Bryis Robinson, 19, got into an altercation inside the Sedgwick County Courthouse on April 8, KWCH reported.
The altercation started after Ms Dee urged the judge to impose the ""maximum possible sentence"" on her son's killer during her court appearance.
She also insulted Robison and his friends and family present in the courtroom.
The mother's remarks before the sentencing created an uproar in the courtroom, resulting in insults exchanged before the first blow was delivered.
A member of Ms Dees' family was seen getting up from his seat and punching one of Robinson's relatives in the face.
This led to a brawl between the two families in the centre of the courtroom.
The District Attorney's office charged Ms Dees with one count of disorderly conduct and a $500 fine, the Sedgwick County Sheriff's Office confirmed.
Others who have been charged with disorderly conduct were Trerntasia Hutton, Derrick Parker, Trentavies Hutton, Trentez Hutton, and a 16-year-old boy.
Before the sentence was delivered, several people were expelled from the courtroom. The judge sentenced Robinson to 21 years and three months in jail for the murder of TrenJ'vious ""Tubby"" Hutton.
In another incident from February, the uncle and stepfather of the accused assaulted a New Mexico murder suspect, Alexander Ortiz, 21, in court.
Ortiz was arrested by Albuquerque police for shooting Alianna Farfan, his ex-girlfriend.
Courtroom video footage showed a man jumping over the barricade separating the public in the courtroom and charging at Ortiz as he tried to escape. Another man followed a few moments later.
A frenzied altercation broke out, with Carlos Lucero, Pete Ysasi, Ortiz, Ortiz's father, a correctional officer, and an anonymous sixth man all grappling on the ground.
Lucero and Ysasi were seen punching a man wearing pants and a dark long-sleeved shirt while the prison guard tried to protect Ortiz.

For the past seven years, Abel has been overseeing Berkshire's BNSF railroad and its treat makers, See's Candies and Dairy Queen, along with dozens of other manufacturing and retail businesses that Buffett acquired over the years.
He grew up in Canada as a hockey player and learned the value of hard work as he redeemed discarded bottles and worked for a small company filling fire extinguishers. Now he finds himself at the top of the food chain in the investment world.
Read:Warren Buffett To Step Down, Greg Abel To Be New Berkshire Hathaway CEO
Berkshire confirmed Abel as Buffett's successor in 2021 after former Vice Chairman Charlie Munger let it slip at the annual meeting. Since then, Abel has largely remained in Buffett's shadow, although shareholders have had a chance to get to know him a bit when he appeared alongside Buffett at the annual meetings and in interviews.
Berkshire's board will now vote on whether to formally approve Abel as the new CEO to take over at the end of 2025. At the annual meeting in Omaha, Buffett said he expects that to occur by a unanimous vote.
Abel will step forward to take responsibility for all of Berkshire's eclectic assortment of businesses with their nearly 400,000 employees and the conglomerate's massive stock portfolio. Buffett and members of Berkshire's board, who for years have devoted much of their time to finding Buffett's successor, have praised Abel's brilliance and knack for understanding all kinds of businesses.
Buffett once said Berkshire is ""so damn lucky"" to have Abel ready to take over, but he will have trouble coming close to Buffett's remarkable track record of outpacing the market. Whereas Buffett grew Berkshire over the decades by making well-timed deals and stock investments at attractive prices, Berkshire's massive size has made it that much harder lately to find anything big enough to change the conglomerate's bottom line.

Abel has big shoes to fill, but no one expects him to match the accomplishments of Buffett, who made him a billionaire many times over and one of the wealthiest investors of the past century. Longtime Berkshire board member Ron Olson said two days before the announcement that he believed Abel was ready to take over.
""Is he another Warren Buffett? No, there is no other Warren Buffett that I know. But he has so many of the fundamentals of Warren,"" Olson said. ""He is for sure high integrity. He is a hard worker. He is a strategic thinker.""
Buffett has said for years that Abel's main job when he becomes CEO will be to preserve Berkshire's unique decentralised culture built on independence, integrity, and trust. In fact, Munger's comment that gave away Abel's future role was that ""Greg will keep the culture.""
Executives at a diverse mix of Berkshire subsidiaries, including sneaker maker Brooks Running, flooring giant Shaw and Borsheims jewelry, have said they all turn to Abel whenever they face tough questions in their businesses related to strategy or operating details, and he's always available when they need him, though he will challenge them.
Read:""Won't Bet On A Currency Going To Hell"": Warren Buffett's Dollar Warning
""When I think about Greg, he not only has high business acumen, but he has really high business instincts,"" Dairy Queen CEO Troy Bader said Friday. ""The intuition is really important. And, you know, Warren has that intuition, but Greg has a lot of it as well.""
Abel has never done many interviews, though he put his detailed business knowledge on display at the Berkshire meetings when discussing utilities and the railroad. But he did offer a glimpse into his background to the Horatio Alger Association when that group honoured him in 2018.
Abel's family-oriented upbringing in Edmonton, Alberta, and lessons in hard work and perseverance were similar to what Buffett learned while working in his grandfather's Omaha grocery store as a kid.
""I think hard work leads to good outcomes. In my schooling, in sports, and in my business positions, I learned that if I put in a lot of work and was well-prepared, then success would be more likely,"" Abel said in 2018.
Abel lives about two hours from Buffett's hometown in Des Moines, Iowa, where he has led Berkshire Hathaway Energy since 2011 and helped coach his kids' hockey and soccer teams. He is expected to continue living there because Berkshire is so decentralised that there is little reason to move to its Omaha headquarters. Buffett only had a couple of dozen people working in his office as he spent his days reading business reports and making the occasional phone call.

The ballistic missile fired by the Iran-backed Houthis in Yemen hit near Israel's Ben Gurion Airport after ""several attempts"" to intercept it failed, the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) said on Sunday. Israel has, meanwhile, pledged to hit back 'seven times stronger' after Yemen missile fire.
The missile struck a grove adjacent to an access road, inside the country's main airport's perimeter, according to a report by the Times of Israel.
The military said it made several attempts to intercept the missile fired from Yemen, but ""an impact was identified in the area of Ben Gurion Airport.""
The Israeli Air Force's aerial defence array is probing the failure. ""An investigation is underway regarding the impact at the Ben Gurion Airport area,"" the Israel Airport Authority says in a statement.
At least six people were reportedly injured after the missile fell on one of the airport's parking lots. Surveillance camera footage emerged on social media showing the moment the Houthi missile struck near the airport.

There was no report of any major damage in the attack, but the airspace was closed for around an hour. However, the airport reopened its airspace and resumed takeoffs and landings shortly after.
Meanwhile, National Unity chairman and former Israeli Minister Benny Gantz, who quit the government last year in June in protest against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's policy on the war in Gaza, called on the government to hold Iran accountable for the strike.
""This is not Yemen, this is Iran. It is Iran that is firing ballistic missiles at the State of Israel, and it must bear responsibility,"" wrote the former defence minister on X.
""The Israeli government must wake up,"" he insisted, arguing that fire on Israel ""must lead to a severe response in Tehran.""

The protest was called by Hefazat-e-Islam-- an influential Bangladeshi Islamist group-- claiming that some of the proposed recommendations hurt ""the sentiments of the majority of the people of this country"".
Leaders of the Hefazat-e-Islam group claimed that draft recommendations of the Women's Affairs Reform Commission instituted by the Muhammad Yunus' interim government are contradictory to Sharia law. The group threatened a nationwide protest on May 23 if the government didn't meet their demands.
Over 20,000 followers of the group rallied near the Dhaka University, some carrying banners and placards reading ""Say no to Western laws on our women, rise up Bangladesh"", in one of their biggest public shows of strength in years as religious activism surged in Bangladesh following the ouster of deposed prime minister Sheikh Hasina's Awami League regime last year. Protestors mostly included teachers and students of non-government or ""kawmi"" madrassas.
Islamist groups in Bangladesh have increased their visibility since former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's ouster, and minority groups have complained of being intimidated.
The protestors mainly denounced proposed recommendations for ensuring equal rights, including ones related to property, for mainly Muslim women. Nayeb-e-Ameer or senior leader of the platform, Maulana Mahfuzul Huq, announced a 12-point charter of demands, with the first one being the abolition of the existing women reform commission and its members punished for the proposed changes, and constituting a new one comprising Islamic scholars and women representatives.
He said the commission's proposed changes hurt ""the sentiments of the majority of the people of this country"" by labelling the religious laws of inheritance as the main cause of inequality between men and women.
The group's leaders also demanded that the interim government led by Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad punus ban the Awami League party led by former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who was ousted in August. Hasina's opponents accuse her government of killing hundreds of students and others during the uprising that ended her 15-year rule. Hasina has been in exile in India since her ouster.
""Men and women can never be equal,"" a women's madrassa teacher, Mohammad Shihab Uddin, told the rally, adding that the Quran outlined specific codes of life for both genders and ""there is no way we can go beyond that"".
The Hefazat called for reinstating ""complete faith and trust in almighty Allah"" in the constitution and asked the government to abandon the ""suicidal concept"" of pluralism and to protect what they said were the Muslims' faith and practices. The group also opposed the inclusion of terms such as ""gender identity,"" ""gender diversity,"" ""gender equality,"" ""gender discrimination,"" ""third gender,"" and ""other genders"".
It argued that these are used to promote LGBT and transgender inclusion under ambiguous slogans such as ""Leave no one behind"" and ""inclusive"" and feared that these ideas could lead to a ""destructive, anti-religious pro-homosexual society"".
The Women's Affairs Reform Commission is one of the several commissions instituted by the interim government to carry out reform. It had recently submitted its recommendations to the government.

US President Donald Trump has signalled he is open to lowering massive tariffs imposed on China, as he acknowledged that the current levies are so high that the two of the world's largest economies have essentially stopped doing business with each other. As part of his 'America First' policy, Trump has imposed a universal 10 per cent tariff on most goods coming into the United States, but duties on Chinese imports were placed as high as 145 per cent. In retaliation, China hiked tariffs by 125 per cent on American imports.
The escalating trade standoff between Beijing and Washington has rattled financial markets and risks driving up costs for manufacturing equipment as well as those of affordable goods like clothing and toys that many Americans rely on.
""At some point, I'm going to lower them, because otherwise, you could never do business with them, and they want to do business very much,"" Trump said in an interview on NBC's 'Meet the Press with Kristen Welker'.
The US President pointed to recent economic struggles in China, where factory activity has declined into the worst contraction since 2023, according to the official manufacturing purchasing managers' index. Furthermore, new export orders have dropped to their lowest point since December 2022, marking the sharpest decline since April of that year, when Shanghai was placed under a full pandemic lockdown, according to a report by Bloomberg.
Trump stated that there have been ""positive"" statements from Beijing recently, while reiterating that any deal finalised with China has to be ""fair.""
Meanwhile, Beijing on Friday showed first signs of being open to sit across the US on the negotiation table since Trump's tariffs were announced last month, and said it was evaluating the possibility of trade talks with Washington.
""China is currently evaluating this,"" the ministry's statement said.
Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One on Sunday, Trump said he has no plans to speak with Chinese President Xi Jinping this week, saying the two sides are ""talking about different things.""
He added that the US is in trade discussions with several countries, including China, and emphasised he's looking for a ""fair deal,"" repeating his claim that ""China has been ripping us off for many years.""

https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/act-like-guests-trump-administration-tells-why-immigrants-green-cards-can-be-revoked-8334396#pfrom=home-ndtvworld_world_top_scroll,"""Act Like Guests"": Team Trump Lists Reasons Why Green Card May Be Revoked","Mon, 05 May 2025 14:40:03 +0530","Not a while ago, immigrants saw a Green Card as a one-way ticket to their American dream and getting a permanent residency in the United States. However, now thousands of green card holders in the US, including Indians, are living in fear of deportation amid President Donald Trump's crackdown on immigration. In a new warning to green card holders, the Trump administration has asked them to behave like a ""guest"" in the US or risk being deported from the country.
Asking green card holders to abide by American ""laws and values"", the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) listed reasons why the government can take away the ""privilege"" of permanent residency from immigrants.
""Green cards and visas will be revoked if an alien breaks the law,"" USCIS said in a post on X.
Having a visa or green card is a privilege that can be taken away. Our rigorous security vetting does not end once you've been granted access to the U.S. If you come to our country and break the law, there will be consequences, and you will lose your privileges.pic.twitter.com/fyK0y0QKAs
""Coming to America and receiving a visa or green card is a privilege. Our laws and values must be respected. If you advocate for violence, endorse or support terrorist activity, or encourage others to do so, you are no longer eligible to stay in the US,"" the Immigration Department added further.
The department added that it is continuously working alongside the Department of Homeland Security to rigorously vet all aliens even after a visa or green card has been obtained.
We continuously work alongside our@DHSgovpartners to rigorously vet all aliens even after a visa or green card has been obtained. This vigilance is essential to making America safe again. Break the laws and you will lose your green card or visa privilege.pic.twitter.com/VM0gjhsFXQ
""This vigilance is essential to making America safe again. Break the laws and you will lose your green card or visa privilege,"" it added.
The move--which follows the launch of a new ""Catch-And-Revoke"" -- raised concerns among legal residents amid the mass deportations of illegal immigrants by the Trump Administration. Announcing the policy, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio has said, ""Whenever the government catches non-US citizens breaking our laws, we will take action to revoke their status. The era of abusing our nation's generosity is over.""
For Indian immigrants, the path to permanent residency or a green card is already particularly daunting. Due to per-country limits, Indian nationals can face wait times of 50 years or more for employment-based green cards. Now, the new rules suggest that even if people secured permanent residency after years of waiting, their future in the US is not secured, and they can be deported over a minor run-in with the law.
Under old norms, immigrants had the legal safeguard to challenge revocations or rectify minor violations, which the new policy could eliminate, potentially making visa revocation a ground for deportation without appeal.

The lawyer was allegedly hacked to death outside the court premises on November 7 last year.
Chittagong's Metropolitan Magistrate S M Alauddin granted the police application for Das' arrest and passed the order during a virtual hearing.
""Investigating officers submitted applications on Sunday to show Chinmoy Krishna Das was arrested in four cases. The court on Monday granted shown arrest in the Alif murder case following a virtual hearing. The hearings on the other three applications will be held on Tuesday,"" Dhaka Tribune quoted Public Prosecutor of the Chittagong Metropolitan Sessions Judge Court, Mofizul Haque Bhuiyan as saying.
Earlier on April 30, the Appellate Division of the Bangladesh Supreme Court stayed the High Court order of granting bail to Das in a sedition case.
Judge of the Appellate Division, Justice Rezaul Haque passed the order after hearing an appeal filed by the state counsel hours after the High Court granted him bail.
The stay order remains in force until the filing of a leave-to-appeal petition and release of the full text of the verdict.
The Bangladesh High Court had earlier granted bail to Das, who was arrested on November 25 last year on charges of sedition, linked to alleged disrespect of the national flag during a rally in Chittagong. His arrest had sparked widespread outrage across the world.
Chinmoy was arrested in Dhaka on November 25 and sent to jail the following day after a Chittagong court rejected his bail plea. On December 11, 2024, the same court again refused bail in the case.
The arrest of Das had sparked massive protests by the Hindu community in Bangladesh, which has been in political turmoil since August 2024 when former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina was removed amidst widespread violent demonstrations.
In the following nine months, Bangladesh has witnessed rising cases of attacks on the Hindu community ever since the Hasina-led government was toppled and an interim administration was formed under the leadership of Muhammad Yunus.
India has taken a tough line on the rights of the Hindu minority and repeatedly stated that there is ""systematic persecution of Hindu minorities"" under the Yunus-led interim government.
Last month, Prime Minister Narendra Modi raised the issue of the safety and security of minorities in Bangladesh, including Hindus, during his meeting with Yunus on the sidelines of the BIMSTEC Summit in Bangkok.
Recently, Bhabesh Chandra Roy, a prominent leader of the Hindu community associated with the Bangladesh Puja Udjapan Committee, was abducted from his home and beaten to death by four individuals on April 18.

""I Don't Know,"" Replies Trump","Mon, 05 May 2025 08:13:52 +0530","Trump expressed uncertainty about upholding the Constitution and dismissed questions on due process for migrants. He distanced himself from pursuing a third term while critiquing Biden's economy. Trump's remarks drew scrutiny from both parties
US President Donald Trump said in remarks airing Sunday that he does not know whether he must uphold the US Constitution, the nation's founding legal document.
In a wide-ranging NBC News interview, the 78-year-old Republican also said he was not seriously considering running for a constitutionally-barred third White House term, and blamed his presidential predecessor Joe Biden for the ""bad parts"" of the current economy.
Trump has drawn widespread criticism for repeatedly brushing up against constitutional guardrails since returning to the White House in January, notably over his policy of mass deportations of undocumented migrants, some without the benefit of a court hearing.
He insists such rapid expulsions are necessary in the face of what he has declared to be a ""national emergency,"" and that giving every migrant a court trial would take ""300 years.""
When NBC's ""Meet the Press"" moderator Kristen Welker asked if citizens and non-citizens alike deserve the due process of law, as the US Constitution states, Trump said: ""I'm not a lawyer. I don't know.""
Pressed on whether he believes he needs to uphold the supreme law of the land, Trump repeated: ""I don't know.""
The remarks quickly made waves in Washington, including among some Republicans.
""We're either a free society governed by the Constitution or we're not,"" Republican Senator Rand Paul, a self-described constitutional conservative, posted on X with no additional comment.
No Third Term?
Trump's suggestion of possibly seeking a third term in office has been sharply questioned by legal and constitutional scholars.
The 22nd Amendment states that ""no person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice.""
But Trump said in March he was ""not joking"" about seeking a third term, adding without elaboration that there are ""methods"" that would allow it to happen.
Changing the Constitution to allow a third term would be a heavy lift, requiring a two-thirds majority in both houses of Congress and ratification by at least 38 of the 50 US state legislatures.
But ""this is not something I'm looking to do,"" Trump told NBC's Welker.
""I'm looking to have four great years and turn it over to somebody, ideally a great Republican, a great Republican to carry it forward.""
Asked who that might be, he mentioned Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, adding: ""We have a lot of good people in this party.""
But Trump appeared to bristle when asked for his reaction to critics who warn he is taking the country down an authoritarian path.
""Why don't you ask it a different way? Many people want to come into our country. Many people love Trump,"" he said. ""I won the election.""
Trump's first 100 days in office were marked by economic turmoil, primarily over his plans to impose sweeping tariffs on most countries.
But despite the world's largest economy shrinking in the first quarter of 2025, he struck an optimistic if defiant tone in the interview, insisting US economics were sound and that ""tariffs are going to make us rich.""
""I think the good parts are the Trump economy and the bad parts are the Biden economy,"" said Trump.
The president also exaggerated some of the success he has had in bringing down prices, claiming gas in the United States has dropped to as low as $1.98 per gallon.
According to the American Automobile Association, the lowest US price per gallon this week was $2.65, with the average at $3.16.
The president, walking with Welker through his glitzy Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, addressed how he wants to build a multi-million-dollar ""ballroom"" in the White House financed by him.
He also ruminated on an upcoming military parade in Washington to coincide with his 79th birthday, on June 14.
""We're going to have a big, beautiful parade,"" he said, swatting away concern about the event's high cost as his administration lays off thousands of government workers.
""We have the greatest weapons in the world, and we're going to celebrate it.""

Bandna Bhatti, who is pursuing a degree in Data Science, slipped and fell from an outdoor staircase at the Phi Kappa Tau fraternity house at around 1 pm on April 19.
After the tragic fall, the woman did not receive proper medical treatment for roughly seven hours before her friends finally called 911, according to a report by FOX KTVU.
""She cannot walk. She cannot move her body,"" her mother, Sukh Bhatti, told KTVU.
According to the family, Bhatti was at a fraternity party on Cal Day at UC Berkeley-- an annual open house for incoming freshmen and their families-- when she fell around 12 feet, landing on a narrow passageway outside the frat house. She struck her head on the way down, where she was left unattended for 15 minutes before being discovered by her friends, her family told KTVU.
Her friends then took her inside the fraternity house, but instead of calling emergency services, people at the frat house allegedly asked them to leave the party with her.  Unaware of the extent of her injuries, Bhatti's friends took her back to her nearby apartment, the family claimed.
Her friends reportedly called 911 around seven hours later.
In addition to a spinal fracture that resulted in paralysis, Bhatti had sustained severe injuries, including tearing of the dura with spinal fluid leakage, a scapular fracture, and a brain hematoma, her sister Sonya Bhatti wrote in a GoFundMe page created to raise money for the college senior's medical care.
""She is currently hospitalised. These injuries are not only life-altering but will require extensive and ongoing medical care, including physical therapy, rehabilitation, and specialised support to help her navigate this new chapter,"" the page reads.
The page mentioned that Bhatti was just three weeks away from graduating from UC Berkeley with a degree in Data Science-""a milestone she had worked so hard for.""
UC Berkeley and the fraternity, meanwhile, said they are offering support to the student and her family.
""UC Berkeley is aware of an ongoing police investigation regarding reports of a student being injured near or at a fraternity. Our thoughts are with the student, their family, loved ones and friends during this time. We are following our protocols to offer support to the student and their family,"" the university said in a statement to PEOPLE.
""Our thoughts are with the individual and their loved ones during this challenging time. The health, safety and well-being of all individuals in our community remain our highest priority,"" Matt Arnold, the CEO of the national Phi Kappa Tau organisation, said in a statement to The New York Post.

This change impacts Pakistan’s earnings from overflight fees.
Amid increasing tension between New Delhi and Islamabad following a terror attack in Jammu and Kashmir's Pahalgam, several international airlines are avoiding Pakistani airspace, according to airlines' statements and flight tracker data. Among major airlines avoiding airspace over Pakistan are Air France, British Airways, UAE's Emirates and Germany's Lufthansa.
The airspace detours follow retaliatory measures between nuclear-armed rivals after a Pakistan-backed terrorist group took responsibility for the Pahalgam terror attack in which 26 people were killed, mostly civilians. In response to the attack, India has closed its airspace to Pakistani carriers. Pakistan has also barred Indian-owned or operated aircraft from its airspace.
Flight tracking data from Flightradar24 showed that Lufthansa Flight LH760 from Frankfurt to New Delhi flew nearly an hour longer on Sunday, as it took a longer route to its destination. The airline, in a statement to news agency Reuters, said Lufthansa Group is ""avoiding Pakistani airspace until further notice."" The carrier added that it is monitoring developments in the region and will update its route accordingly.
Flight tracking data showed some flights of British Airways, Swiss International Air Lines and Emirates were also turning north towards Delhi in order to avoid Pakistani airspace, after travelling over the Arabian Sea.
Citing the ""recent evolution of tensions"" between India and Pakistan, Air France, in a statement, said that it has ""decided to suspend overflight of Pakistan until further notice.""
The carrier said it was altering its flight schedule and plans with destinations such as Delhi, Bangkok and Ho Chi Minh, entailing longer flight times.
So far, British Airways, Swiss International Air Lines and Emirates have not issued any formal statements, but their rerouted flights reflect broader industry caution, despite longer distances and higher fuel costs for airlines.
The flight route alterations are set to cut Pakistan's earnings from overflight fees, which can run into hundreds of dollars a flight, depending on aircraft weight and distance covered.
Pakistan's reserves with the central bank stand at $10.2 billion, barely enough to cover two months' worth of imports, according to a Reuters report.

Aspergillus, a type of fungus that thrives in warm, damp climates, has the potential to infect millions if it makes its way into the aforementioned regions.
Norman van Rhijn, the study co-author, has warned that the world was approaching a ""tipping point"" where the spread of fungal pathogens could become the norm.
""We're talking about hundreds of thousands of lives, and continental shifts in species distributions. In 50 years, where things grow and what you get infected by is going to be completely different,"" Mr Van Rhijn told theFinancial Times.
As per the study, the species can grow quickly in high temperatures in compost, which explains why it is able to thrive in the 37C internal temperature of the human body. Additionally, fungi's resilience means they can survive and thrive in places that other organisms can't, even inside Chernobyl's nuclear reactors.
While inhaling the fungus's spores does not make everyone ill, those with conditions such as asthma, cystic fibrosis or a weakened immune system remain at risk.

What makes the situation worrisome is the fact that the fungal kingdom is largely unexplored by scientists. Less than 10 per cent of an estimated 1.5 to 3.8 million fungi species have been described, and only a tiny fraction have had their genetic material (genome) sequenced.
""Its lifestyle in the natural environment may have provided Aspergillus fumigatus with the fitness advantage needed to colonise human lungs,"" said Professor Elaine Bignell, co-director at the MRC Centre for Medical Mycology at Exeter University.
The study highlighted thatAspergillus fumigatuscould spread across an additional 77 per cent of territory by the year 2100 as a result of the world's heavy use of fossil fuels. As a result, potentially nine million people in Europe could be exposed to the infection.
While the danger is imminent, scientists say the development of antifungal medicines has been hobbled by the financial unattractiveness of investing in them, because of high costs and doubts over their profitability.

Ariana Rodriguez's discoveries include Hermes boxes, Prada shoes, a vintage Burberry coat, and even a Sohmer & Co piano, with values ranging from hundreds to thousands of dollars.
A 35-year-old mother-of-three, Ms Rodriguez started thrifting three years ago when she joined her local 'buy nothing' Facebook group. There, she discovered the world of ""stooping"" - sourcing items left out on the street. She was drawn to the idea of finding free goods, particularly for her children, aged six, three, and two.
Six months ago, Ms Rodriguez started digging through dumpsters and trash bags. She estimates that her finds could be worth anywhere from $10,000 (over Rs 8.4 lakh) to $30,000 (over Rs 25.3 lakh). While she keeps some items, including arts and crafts, for her children, others are given away or sold. Anything non-perishable, including clothes and blankets, goes to her local church to help those in need,The NY Postreported.
In her quest for treasure, Ms Rodriguez heads out with full glam. She dresses up in her best outfits for her treasure hunts, hoping to challenge the stigma surrounding dumpster diving. ""Anyone can do it,"" she tells the NY Post. ""I hope the stigmas are removed, there's nothing wrong with it.""
Some of her recent findings include a Stokke high chair worth $397 (around Rs 33,000), a bag of games valued at $200 (almost Rs 17,000), and a glass vanity worth $2,500 (almost Rs 2.1 lakh). Ms Rodriguez often resells furniture, or in the case of small trinkets, puts them up for sale.
She said her efforts also contribute to reducing waste. ""The biggest part of it is my profound desire to keep things out of the landfill,"" she shared.
Ms Rodrguez also frequently visits apartment cleanouts where people toss out unwanted furniture. She has uncovered everything from mirrors and nightstands to real gold jewellery and even money. Her most significant find was a Bally briefcase, which she believes dates back to the 1960s.
""I've found incredible pieces,"" she said, ""People get sick of furniture and just dump it.""
She faces criticism from people who say her trash diving is unsanitary, but she remains unbothered. ""It's more embarrassing to be over-consuming and throwing everything out,"" she said. Her husband, a day trader, has even joined her in the adventure, showing that this is a family affair.
Ms Rodriguez's most recent treasure includes a table worth $750 to $3,500 (Rs 62,500 to Rs 2,91,500), Jibbitz charms valued at $50 (Rs 4,100), a basketball hoop worth $35 (Rs 2,900), a bag of Hermes boxes valued at $175 (Rs 14,500), a glass lamp worth $150 (Rs 12,500), a bag of games valued at $200 (Rs 16,700), a glass vanity worth $2,500 (Rs 2,08,000), and a bedside table valued at $949 (Rs 78,800).
She believes dumpster diving is like digging for gold. ""You never know what you're going to find,"" she said. ""When you're out doing a trash dig, you'll see someone's whole life. There is a whole historical component.""

It is currently a tourist site.
Once one of the US' toughest prisons, the Alcatraz facility will now house the country's most ruthless and violent offenders.On Truth Social, the US President wrote, ""Today I am directing the Bureau of Prisons, together with the Department of Justice, FBI, and Homeland Security, to reopen a substantially enlarged and rebuilt ALCATRAZ.""
All About Alcatraz Prison
Alcatraz Prison, once a maximum security federal prison, is located off the coast of San Francisco, California. Once a fort, it was turned into a US Army military prison in 1912. It was then used as a facility for the Federal Bureau of Prisons in 1934 after the buildings were modernised and security increased.
The three-storey cellhouse was believed to be the most secure prison in the US. Its isolation, the frigid waters, strong ocean currents, and the presence of sharks made it impossible for anyone to escape it.
The main prison building had three floors and included four cell blocks, the warden's office, a visiting room, a library, and a barber shop. The most dangerous prisoners were sent to D-Block, and six cells at the end were called The Hole.
The prison corridors were named after famous US streets such as Broadway and Michigan Avenue. When the buildings were modernised in 1934, they reused the construction materials such as iron staircases, cell house doors near the barber shop, and granite blocks - originally used to hold guns - to build the wharf's walls.
They also used old prison bars to strengthen the walls before being replaced after the salt air and water caused erosion.
The Alcatraz prison was the last resort for criminals considered the most dangerous. Among the famous ones housed here were Alphonse ""AI"" Capone, also known as Scarface; George ""Machine Gun"" Kelly, who was involved in bootlegging and kidnapping during the Prohibition era; and Robert Franklin Stroud, also known as the ""Birdman of Alcatraz,"" who was convicted of manslaughter in 1909. He later murdered a prison guard.
Other criminals included Alvin ""Creepy"" Karpis, Arthur ""Doc"" Barker, Henri Young, and Bumpy Johnson.
The Alcatraz prison was closed in 1963 due to its high maintenance costs and deteriorating conditions. In 1972, the US government handed over the island to the National Park Service (NPS), which then became a part of the Golden Gate National Recreation Area.
The prison buildings were preserved and turned into a museum. Visitors could tour the prison cells and see the famous escape routes. They were also entertained with audio guides and information displays.

US President Donald Trump has signalled he is open to lowering massive tariffs imposed on China, as he acknowledged that the current levies are so high that the two of the world's largest economies have essentially stopped doing business with each other. As part of his 'America First' policy, Trump has imposed a universal 10 per cent tariff on most goods coming into the United States, but duties on Chinese imports were placed as high as 145 per cent. In retaliation, China hiked tariffs by 125 per cent on American imports.
The escalating trade standoff between Beijing and Washington has rattled financial markets and risks driving up costs for manufacturing equipment as well as those of affordable goods like clothing and toys that many Americans rely on.
""At some point, I'm going to lower them, because otherwise, you could never do business with them, and they want to do business very much,"" Trump said in an interview on NBC's 'Meet the Press with Kristen Welker'.
The US President pointed to recent economic struggles in China, where factory activity has declined into the worst contraction since 2023, according to the official manufacturing purchasing managers' index. Furthermore, new export orders have dropped to their lowest point since December 2022, marking the sharpest decline since April of that year, when Shanghai was placed under a full pandemic lockdown, according to a report by Bloomberg.
Trump stated that there have been ""positive"" statements from Beijing recently, while reiterating that any deal finalised with China has to be ""fair.""
Meanwhile, Beijing on Friday showed first signs of being open to sit across the US on the negotiation table since Trump's tariffs were announced last month, and said it was evaluating the possibility of trade talks with Washington.
""China is currently evaluating this,"" the ministry's statement said.
Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One on Sunday, Trump said he has no plans to speak with Chinese President Xi Jinping this week, saying the two sides are ""talking about different things.""
He added that the US is in trade discussions with several countries, including China, and emphasised he's looking for a ""fair deal,"" repeating his claim that ""China has been ripping us off for many years.""

However, now thousands of green card holders in the US, including Indians, are living in fear of deportation amid President Donald Trump's crackdown on immigration. In a new warning to green card holders, the Trump administration has asked them to behave like a ""guest"" in the US or risk being deported from the country.
Asking green card holders to abide by American ""laws and values"", the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) listed reasons why the government can take away the ""privilege"" of permanent residency from immigrants.
""Green cards and visas will be revoked if an alien breaks the law,"" USCIS said in a post on X.
Having a visa or green card is a privilege that can be taken away. Our rigorous security vetting does not end once you've been granted access to the U.S. If you come to our country and break the law, there will be consequences, and you will lose your privileges.pic.twitter.com/fyK0y0QKAs
""Coming to America and receiving a visa or green card is a privilege. Our laws and values must be respected. If you advocate for violence, endorse or support terrorist activity, or encourage others to do so, you are no longer eligible to stay in the US,"" the Immigration Department added further.
The department added that it is continuously working alongside the Department of Homeland Security to rigorously vet all aliens even after a visa or green card has been obtained.
We continuously work alongside our@DHSgovpartners to rigorously vet all aliens even after a visa or green card has been obtained. This vigilance is essential to making America safe again. Break the laws and you will lose your green card or visa privilege.pic.twitter.com/VM0gjhsFXQ
""This vigilance is essential to making America safe again. Break the laws and you will lose your green card or visa privilege,"" it added.
The move--which follows the launch of a new ""Catch-And-Revoke"" -- raised concerns among legal residents amid the mass deportations of illegal immigrants by the Trump Administration. Announcing the policy, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio has said, ""Whenever the government catches non-US citizens breaking our laws, we will take action to revoke their status. The era of abusing our nation's generosity is over.""
For Indian immigrants, the path to permanent residency or a green card is already particularly daunting. Due to per-country limits, Indian nationals can face wait times of 50 years or more for employment-based green cards. Now, the new rules suggest that even if people secured permanent residency after years of waiting, their future in the US is not secured, and they can be deported over a minor run-in with the law.
Under old norms, immigrants had the legal safeguard to challenge revocations or rectify minor violations, which the new policy could eliminate, potentially making visa revocation a ground for deportation without appeal.

The stay order remains in force until the filing of a leave-to-appeal petition and release of the full text of the verdict.
The Bangladesh High Court had earlier granted bail to Das, who was arrested on November 25 last year on charges of sedition, linked to alleged disrespect of the national flag during a rally in Chittagong. His arrest had sparked widespread outrage across the world.
Chinmoy was arrested in Dhaka on November 25 and sent to jail the following day after a Chittagong court rejected his bail plea. On December 11, 2024, the same court again refused bail in the case.
The arrest of Das had sparked massive protests by the Hindu community in Bangladesh, which has been in political turmoil since August 2024 when former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina was removed amidst widespread violent demonstrations.
In the following nine months, Bangladesh has witnessed rising cases of attacks on the Hindu community ever since the Hasina-led government was toppled and an interim administration was formed under the leadership of Muhammad Yunus.
India has taken a tough line on the rights of the Hindu minority and repeatedly stated that there is ""systematic persecution of Hindu minorities"" under the Yunus-led interim government.
Last month, Prime Minister Narendra Modi raised the issue of the safety and security of minorities in Bangladesh, including Hindus, during his meeting with Yunus on the sidelines of the BIMSTEC Summit in Bangkok.
Recently, Bhabesh Chandra Roy, a prominent leader of the Hindu community associated with the Bangladesh Puja Udjapan Committee, was abducted from his home and beaten to death by four individuals on April 18.

""I Don't Know,"" Replies Trump","Mon, 05 May 2025 08:13:52 +0530","Trump expressed uncertainty about upholding the Constitution and dismissed questions on due process for migrants. He distanced himself from pursuing a third term while critiquing Biden's economy. Trump's remarks drew scrutiny from both parties
US President Donald Trump said in remarks airing Sunday that he does not know whether he must uphold the US Constitution, the nation's founding legal document.
In a wide-ranging NBC News interview, the 78-year-old Republican also said he was not seriously considering running for a constitutionally-barred third White House term, and blamed his presidential predecessor Joe Biden for the ""bad parts"" of the current economy.
Trump has drawn widespread criticism for repeatedly brushing up against constitutional guardrails since returning to the White House in January, notably over his policy of mass deportations of undocumented migrants, some without the benefit of a court hearing.
He insists such rapid expulsions are necessary in the face of what he has declared to be a ""national emergency,"" and that giving every migrant a court trial would take ""300 years.""
When NBC's ""Meet the Press"" moderator Kristen Welker asked if citizens and non-citizens alike deserve the due process of law, as the US Constitution states, Trump said: ""I'm not a lawyer. I don't know.""
Pressed on whether he believes he needs to uphold the supreme law of the land, Trump repeated: ""I don't know.""
The remarks quickly made waves in Washington, including among some Republicans.
""We're either a free society governed by the Constitution or we're not,"" Republican Senator Rand Paul, a self-described constitutional conservative, posted on X with no additional comment.
No Third Term?
Trump's suggestion of possibly seeking a third term in office has been sharply questioned by legal and constitutional scholars.
The 22nd Amendment states that ""no person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice.""
But Trump said in March he was ""not joking"" about seeking a third term, adding without elaboration that there are ""methods"" that would allow it to happen.
Changing the Constitution to allow a third term would be a heavy lift, requiring a two-thirds majority in both houses of Congress and ratification by at least 38 of the 50 US state legislatures.
But ""this is not something I'm looking to do,"" Trump told NBC's Welker.
""I'm looking to have four great years and turn it over to somebody, ideally a great Republican, a great Republican to carry it forward.""
Asked who that might be, he mentioned Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, adding: ""We have a lot of good people in this party.""
But Trump appeared to bristle when asked for his reaction to critics who warn he is taking the country down an authoritarian path.
""Why don't you ask it a different way? Many people want to come into our country. Many people love Trump,"" he said. ""I won the election.""
Trump's first 100 days in office were marked by economic turmoil, primarily over his plans to impose sweeping tariffs on most countries.
But despite the world's largest economy shrinking in the first quarter of 2025, he struck an optimistic if defiant tone in the interview, insisting US economics were sound and that ""tariffs are going to make us rich.""
""I think the good parts are the Trump economy and the bad parts are the Biden economy,"" said Trump.
The president also exaggerated some of the success he has had in bringing down prices, claiming gas in the United States has dropped to as low as $1.98 per gallon.
According to the American Automobile Association, the lowest US price per gallon this week was $2.65, with the average at $3.16.
The president, walking with Welker through his glitzy Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, addressed how he wants to build a multi-million-dollar ""ballroom"" in the White House financed by him.
He also ruminated on an upcoming military parade in Washington to coincide with his 79th birthday, on June 14.
""We're going to have a big, beautiful parade,"" he said, swatting away concern about the event's high cost as his administration lays off thousands of government workers.
""We have the greatest weapons in the world, and we're going to celebrate it.""

Bandna Bhatti, who is pursuing a degree in Data Science, slipped and fell from an outdoor staircase at the Phi Kappa Tau fraternity house at around 1 pm on April 19.
After the tragic fall, the woman did not receive proper medical treatment for roughly seven hours before her friends finally called 911, according to a report by FOX KTVU.
""She cannot walk. She cannot move her body,"" her mother, Sukh Bhatti, told KTVU.
According to the family, Bhatti was at a fraternity party on Cal Day at UC Berkeley-- an annual open house for incoming freshmen and their families-- when she fell around 12 feet, landing on a narrow passageway outside the frat house. She struck her head on the way down, where she was left unattended for 15 minutes before being discovered by her friends, her family told KTVU.
Her friends then took her inside the fraternity house, but instead of calling emergency services, people at the frat house allegedly asked them to leave the party with her.  Unaware of the extent of her injuries, Bhatti's friends took her back to her nearby apartment, the family claimed.
Her friends reportedly called 911 around seven hours later.
In addition to a spinal fracture that resulted in paralysis, Bhatti had sustained severe injuries, including tearing of the dura with spinal fluid leakage, a scapular fracture, and a brain hematoma, her sister Sonya Bhatti wrote in a GoFundMe page created to raise money for the college senior's medical care.
""She is currently hospitalised. These injuries are not only life-altering but will require extensive and ongoing medical care, including physical therapy, rehabilitation, and specialised support to help her navigate this new chapter,"" the page reads.
The page mentioned that Bhatti was just three weeks away from graduating from UC Berkeley with a degree in Data Science-""a milestone she had worked so hard for.""
UC Berkeley and the fraternity, meanwhile, said they are offering support to the student and her family.
""UC Berkeley is aware of an ongoing police investigation regarding reports of a student being injured near or at a fraternity. Our thoughts are with the student, their family, loved ones and friends during this time. We are following our protocols to offer support to the student and their family,"" the university said in a statement to PEOPLE.
""Our thoughts are with the individual and their loved ones during this challenging time. The health, safety and well-being of all individuals in our community remain our highest priority,"" Matt Arnold, the CEO of the national Phi Kappa Tau organisation, said in a statement to The New York Post.

This change impacts Pakistan’s earnings from overflight fees.
Amid increasing tension between New Delhi and Islamabad following a terror attack in Jammu and Kashmir's Pahalgam, several international airlines are avoiding Pakistani airspace, according to airlines' statements and flight tracker data. Among major airlines avoiding airspace over Pakistan are Air France, British Airways, UAE's Emirates and Germany's Lufthansa.
The airspace detours follow retaliatory measures between nuclear-armed rivals after a Pakistan-backed terrorist group took responsibility for the Pahalgam terror attack in which 26 people were killed, mostly civilians. In response to the attack, India has closed its airspace to Pakistani carriers. Pakistan has also barred Indian-owned or operated aircraft from its airspace.
Flight tracking data from Flightradar24 showed that Lufthansa Flight LH760 from Frankfurt to New Delhi flew nearly an hour longer on Sunday, as it took a longer route to its destination. The airline, in a statement to news agency Reuters, said Lufthansa Group is ""avoiding Pakistani airspace until further notice."" The carrier added that it is monitoring developments in the region and will update its route accordingly.
Flight tracking data showed some flights of British Airways, Swiss International Air Lines and Emirates were also turning north towards Delhi in order to avoid Pakistani airspace, after travelling over the Arabian Sea.
Citing the ""recent evolution of tensions"" between India and Pakistan, Air France, in a statement, said that it has ""decided to suspend overflight of Pakistan until further notice.""
The carrier said it was altering its flight schedule and plans with destinations such as Delhi, Bangkok and Ho Chi Minh, entailing longer flight times.
So far, British Airways, Swiss International Air Lines and Emirates have not issued any formal statements, but their rerouted flights reflect broader industry caution, despite longer distances and higher fuel costs for airlines.
The flight route alterations are set to cut Pakistan's earnings from overflight fees, which can run into hundreds of dollars a flight, depending on aircraft weight and distance covered.
Pakistan's reserves with the central bank stand at $10.2 billion, barely enough to cover two months' worth of imports, according to a Reuters report.

Aspergillus, a type of fungus that thrives in warm, damp climates, has the potential to infect millions if it makes its way into the aforementioned regions.
Norman van Rhijn, the study co-author, has warned that the world was approaching a ""tipping point"" where the spread of fungal pathogens could become the norm.
""We're talking about hundreds of thousands of lives, and continental shifts in species distributions. In 50 years, where things grow and what you get infected by is going to be completely different,"" Mr Van Rhijn told theFinancial Times.
As per the study, the species can grow quickly in high temperatures in compost, which explains why it is able to thrive in the 37C internal temperature of the human body. Additionally, fungi's resilience means they can survive and thrive in places that other organisms can't, even inside Chernobyl's nuclear reactors.
While inhaling the fungus's spores does not make everyone ill, those with conditions such as asthma, cystic fibrosis or a weakened immune system remain at risk.

What makes the situation worrisome is the fact that the fungal kingdom is largely unexplored by scientists. Less than 10 per cent of an estimated 1.5 to 3.8 million fungi species have been described, and only a tiny fraction have had their genetic material (genome) sequenced.
""Its lifestyle in the natural environment may have provided Aspergillus fumigatus with the fitness advantage needed to colonise human lungs,"" said Professor Elaine Bignell, co-director at the MRC Centre for Medical Mycology at Exeter University.
The study highlighted thatAspergillus fumigatuscould spread across an additional 77 per cent of territory by the year 2100 as a result of the world's heavy use of fossil fuels. As a result, potentially nine million people in Europe could be exposed to the infection.
While the danger is imminent, scientists say the development of antifungal medicines has been hobbled by the financial unattractiveness of investing in them, because of high costs and doubts over their profitability.

Ariana Rodriguez's discoveries include Hermes boxes, Prada shoes, a vintage Burberry coat, and even a Sohmer & Co piano, with values ranging from hundreds to thousands of dollars.
A 35-year-old mother-of-three, Ms Rodriguez started thrifting three years ago when she joined her local 'buy nothing' Facebook group. There, she discovered the world of ""stooping"" - sourcing items left out on the street. She was drawn to the idea of finding free goods, particularly for her children, aged six, three, and two.
Six months ago, Ms Rodriguez started digging through dumpsters and trash bags. She estimates that her finds could be worth anywhere from $10,000 (over Rs 8.4 lakh) to $30,000 (over Rs 25.3 lakh). While she keeps some items, including arts and crafts, for her children, others are given away or sold. Anything non-perishable, including clothes and blankets, goes to her local church to help those in need,The NY Postreported.
In her quest for treasure, Ms Rodriguez heads out with full glam. She dresses up in her best outfits for her treasure hunts, hoping to challenge the stigma surrounding dumpster diving. ""Anyone can do it,"" she tells the NY Post. ""I hope the stigmas are removed, there's nothing wrong with it.""
Some of her recent findings include a Stokke high chair worth $397 (around Rs 33,000), a bag of games valued at $200 (almost Rs 17,000), and a glass vanity worth $2,500 (almost Rs 2.1 lakh). Ms Rodriguez often resells furniture, or in the case of small trinkets, puts them up for sale.
She said her efforts also contribute to reducing waste. ""The biggest part of it is my profound desire to keep things out of the landfill,"" she shared.
Ms Rodrguez also frequently visits apartment cleanouts where people toss out unwanted furniture. She has uncovered everything from mirrors and nightstands to real gold jewellery and even money. Her most significant find was a Bally briefcase, which she believes dates back to the 1960s.
""I've found incredible pieces,"" she said, ""People get sick of furniture and just dump it.""
She faces criticism from people who say her trash diving is unsanitary, but she remains unbothered. ""It's more embarrassing to be over-consuming and throwing everything out,"" she said. Her husband, a day trader, has even joined her in the adventure, showing that this is a family affair.
Ms Rodriguez's most recent treasure includes a table worth $750 to $3,500 (Rs 62,500 to Rs 2,91,500), Jibbitz charms valued at $50 (Rs 4,100), a basketball hoop worth $35 (Rs 2,900), a bag of Hermes boxes valued at $175 (Rs 14,500), a glass lamp worth $150 (Rs 12,500), a bag of games valued at $200 (Rs 16,700), a glass vanity worth $2,500 (Rs 2,08,000), and a bedside table valued at $949 (Rs 78,800).
She believes dumpster diving is like digging for gold. ""You never know what you're going to find,"" she said. ""When you're out doing a trash dig, you'll see someone's whole life. There is a whole historical component.""

Skype's parent company, Microsoft, announced the closure in February, stating that the free video-calling portal will be replaced by Microsoft Teams.
While the closure affects both free and paid Skype users, the Skype for Business users will be assimilated into Microsoft Teams, which offers many of the same core features and more.

The arrival of the COVID-19 pandemic and competitors such as Zoom, Webex, Discord and Slack was the final death knell for the platform.

It is currently a tourist site.
Once one of the US' toughest prisons, the Alcatraz facility will now house the country's most ruthless and violent offenders.On Truth Social, the US President wrote, ""Today I am directing the Bureau of Prisons, together with the Department of Justice, FBI, and Homeland Security, to reopen a substantially enlarged and rebuilt ALCATRAZ.""
All About Alcatraz Prison
Alcatraz Prison, once a maximum security federal prison, is located off the coast of San Francisco, California. Once a fort, it was turned into a US Army military prison in 1912. It was then used as a facility for the Federal Bureau of Prisons in 1934 after the buildings were modernised and security increased.
The three-storey cellhouse was believed to be the most secure prison in the US. Its isolation, the frigid waters, strong ocean currents, and the presence of sharks made it impossible for anyone to escape it.
The main prison building had three floors and included four cell blocks, the warden's office, a visiting room, a library, and a barber shop. The most dangerous prisoners were sent to D-Block, and six cells at the end were called The Hole.
The prison corridors were named after famous US streets such as Broadway and Michigan Avenue. When the buildings were modernised in 1934, they reused the construction materials such as iron staircases, cell house doors near the barber shop, and granite blocks - originally used to hold guns - to build the wharf's walls.
They also used old prison bars to strengthen the walls before being replaced after the salt air and water caused erosion.
The Alcatraz prison was the last resort for criminals considered the most dangerous. Among the famous ones housed here were Alphonse ""AI"" Capone, also known as Scarface; George ""Machine Gun"" Kelly, who was involved in bootlegging and kidnapping during the Prohibition era; and Robert Franklin Stroud, also known as the ""Birdman of Alcatraz,"" who was convicted of manslaughter in 1909. He later murdered a prison guard.
Other criminals included Alvin ""Creepy"" Karpis, Arthur ""Doc"" Barker, Henri Young, and Bumpy Johnson.
The Alcatraz prison was closed in 1963 due to its high maintenance costs and deteriorating conditions. In 1972, the US government handed over the island to the National Park Service (NPS), which then became a part of the Golden Gate National Recreation Area.
The prison buildings were preserved and turned into a museum. Visitors could tour the prison cells and see the famous escape routes. They were also entertained with audio guides and information displays.

Families scoured hospitals and victim identification stations hoping to find their loved ones, with around 200 people still listed as missing and 89 bodies as yet unidentified.
Flames moved quickly through the Wang Fuk Court housing estate in Tai Po district on Wednesday afternoon, spreading through seven of the eight high-rises and transforming the densely packed complex into an inferno.
The blaze was ""largely extinguished"" by Friday morning after burning for more than 40 hours, the fire services said, announcing they had finished their search of over 1,800 flats for survivors.
Authorities are investigating what sparked the fire, including examining the bamboo scaffolding and netting wrapped around the complex as part of a major renovation.
The Hong Kong government said on Friday it appeared the fire had started in protective netting on the lower floors of one of the towers and that foam boards and bamboo scaffolding had contributed to its spread.
Fire services chief Andy Yeung said earlier they had discovered that alarm systems in all eight blocks ""were malfunctioning"".
""We will take enforcement actions against the contractors responsible,"" Yeung told a press conference.
Residents had recounted having to run door-to-door to alert neighbours to the danger.
At the charred apartment blocks on Friday morning, workers brought out bodies in black bags, with an AFP reporter counting four in one 15-minute period.
Vehicles unloaded corpses at a mortuary in nearby Sha Tin, another reporter saw, with families arriving in the afternoon for identification.
At one hospital in Sha Tin, a woman surnamed Wong was looking for her sister-in-law and her sister-in-law's twin, with no luck.
""We still cannot find them. So we are going to different hospitals to ask if they have good news,"" the 38-year-old told AFP in tears.
""We were already waiting at the Prince of Wales Hospital on the first day but there was no news. We also came here yesterday.""
The last contact anyone had with the twins was on Wednesday afternoon, said Wong, around the time the fire was reported.
""One building went up in flames and it spread to two more blocks in less than 15 minutes,"" a 77-year-old eyewitness surnamed Mui told AFP.
""It was very quick. It was burning red, I shudder to think about it.""
The blaze was Hong Kong's deadliest since 1948, when an explosion followed by a fire killed at least 135 people.
Lethal blazes were once a regular scourge in densely populated Hong Kong, especially in poorer neighbourhoods, but improved safety measures have made them far less common.
The city's security chief Chris Tang said the investigation into the fire's causes could take up to three to four weeks.
Hong Kong's anti-corruption body said on Thursday it had launched a probe into renovation work at the complex, hours after police said they had arrested three men on suspicion of negligently leaving foam packaging at the fire site.
The Labour Department told AFP on Friday that it had conducted 16 inspections of the maintenance work at Wang Fuk Court since July 2024, the most recent on November 20, after which the department issued written warnings to remind the contractor to ""implement appropriate fire prevention measures"".
Hong Kong authorities will immediately inspect all housing estates undergoing major work following the disaster, and will look into shifting construction sites to metal scaffolding in the longer term.
Hong Kong's government has announced a HK$300 million ($38.5 million) fund to help victims of the fire.
City authorities said they had opened nine shelters and were organising temporary accommodation and emergency funds for those who had lost their homes.
Activities around Hong Kong's legislative elections on December 7 have been suspended.
A spontaneous community effort to help firefighters and those displaced had become a well-oiled machine by Friday.
Separate supply stations for clothes, food and household goods had been set up at a public square near the towers, as well as booths providing medical and psychological care.
So much was donated that organisers put out a call on social media saying no more was needed.

US officials have identified the detained suspect in Wednesday's shooting as an Afghan national who previously worked with American forces in Afghanistan.
The 29-year-old suspect was granted asylum -- not permanent residency -- in April this year, according to AfghanEvac, a group that helped resettle Afghans in the United States after the 2021 Taliban takeover.
""I have directed a full scale, rigorous reexamination of every Green Card for every alien from every country of concern,"" said Joseph Edlow, director of the US Customs and Immigration Services (USCIS), on X.
When asked to specify to which countries Edlow was referring, a USCIS spokesperson pointed AFP to President Donald Trump's June executive order classifying 19 countries as ""of Identified Concern.""
The order banned entry of almost all nationals from 12 of the countries, including Afghanistan.
The 11 other countries facing a travel ban were: Myanmar, Chad, Congo-Brazzaville, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen.
Trump also imposed a partial ban on travelers from seven other countries: Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela. Some temporary work visas from those countries are allowed.

The agreement comes just days after Taliban Minister for Industry and Commerce Alhaj Nooruddin Azizi concluded a high-profile visit to India seeking deeper trade and investment ties.
The MoU, signed in Dubai between Afghanistan's Rofi's International Group of Companies and India's Zydus Lifesciences, is being hailed as a landmark step in rebuilding Afghanistan's pharmaceutical capacity while expanding India's footprint in the country's healthcare sector. The signing ceremony took place at the Afghan Consulate in Dubai in the presence of the Afghan Ambassador and senior commercial officials.

According to Afghanistan's Ministry of Industry and Commerce, Zydus Life sciences, one of India's major pharmaceutical manufacturers, will initially export medicines to Afghanistan. Over time, the company will relocate its representative office to Afghanistan and begin domestic drug production. Officials confirm that the transfer of technical data and know-how for local manufacturing has already begun.
The Afghan Consulate described the agreement as a transformative move to improve healthcare standards, reduce dependence on substandard imported medicines, and significantly upgrade technical capabilities of Afghan pharmaceutical facilities. Afghan traders have publicly endorsed the deal as a model for future strategic partnerships.
This development comes at a critical geopolitical moment. The Taliban recently banned trade with Pakistan, directing Afghan firms to wind up pharmaceutical business ties with Pakistani suppliers within three months. The new India-Afghanistan pact is therefore widely viewed as a direct setback to Pakistan, which has traditionally acted as a key transit and trade hub for Afghan commerce.
READ:""Kabul Open To Business"": Taliban Minister's Trade Pitch To India Amid Pakistan Border Crisis
Earlier this week, Minister Azizi told NDTV that during his maiden India visit, he called for a dramatic expansion of bilateral trade, investment, and diplomatic engagement. Emphasising that Afghanistan is ""open for business,"" he had assured full security guarantees for Indian companies and diplomats in Kabul.
The MoU worth $100 now stands as the first concrete outcome of that outreach, signalling Kabul's intent to diversify trade partnerships, deepen strategic ties with New Delhi, and reduce reliance on Pakistani trade channels.

He said that US President Donald Trump's plan was ""a set of issues put forward for discussion"" rather than a draft agreement, adding that it could become the basis of future agreements.
He said the Kyiv leadership lost legitimacy after refusing to hold elections when President Volodymyr Zelenskiy's elected term expired. Meanwhile, Kyiv said it cannot hold elections while under martial law and defending its territory against Russia.
The Russian leader said that although the US was considering Russia's position, there are other things that need to be discussed.
""We need to sit down and discuss this seriously,"" Putin told reporters at the end of a three-day visit to Kyrgyzstan. ""Every word matters.""
He explained that hostilities will cease if Ukrainian troops withdraw from territories they occupy. ""If they don't withdraw, we will achieve this by force,"" he said.
Putin has previously demanded that Ukraine completely withdraw from the entirety of the Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhia regions before Russia considers any sort of ""peace negotiations"", notably including areas of each of those oblasts that Russia does not occupy.
He also wants to keep Ukraine from joining NATO and hosting any Western troops, allowing Moscow to gradually pull the country back into its orbit.
US special envoy Steve Witkoff will visit Moscow next week, while US Army Secretary Dan Driscoll may be heading to Kyiv.
Moscow invaded Ukraine in February 2022, triggering the worst armed conflict in Europe since World War II.

Additional Interior Secretary of Pakistan, Salman Chaudhry, disclosed the development during a meeting of the Senate Functional Committee on Human Rights. Chaudhry also said that once the ban is imposed, it will be difficult to get it removed, per a report by Pakistani newspaper Dawn.
Overseas Employment Promoter Aisam Baig said the UAE government was worried that Pakistanis on ""visit visas, not work visas"" resort to begging in the country.
The UAE is currently only issuing visas to holders of blue and diplomatic passports.
Pakistani Senator Samina Mumtaz Zehri, chair of the Senate committee on human rights, stated that only a handful of citizens were granted visas ""after much difficulty"".
Earlier, the UAE had made it mandatory for visa applicants to provide a character certificate provided by the police.
Gulf countries and cities, especially Dubai and Abu Dhabi, are preferred by millions of Pakistani travellers and job seekers. More than 8,00,000 Pakistanis apply for visas to Gulf and Middle Eastern countries each year.
In December 2024, the UAE, Saudi Arabia and several other Gulf countries imposed an indefinite ban on granting visas to people from at least 30 different cities of Pakistan, following an alarming rise in the number of cases where Pakistani nationals were caught begging or being involved in smuggling, drug trafficking, human trafficking and other criminal offences abroad.
Podcaster Nadir Ali said in an interview, ""Saudi Arabia and Dubai were popular destinations, but have now stopped giving visas. I too had to face a great difficulty when I wanted to go for the IIFA Awards. In fact, Saudi Arabia has given a warning to Pakistan with regard to the increasing number of cases of beggars being caught.""
The UAE is one of Pakistan's largest trading partners in the Middle East, with a large Pakistani expatriate population living and working there.

Yet the episode has once again turned national attention toward the long-feared Central Jail Rawalpindi, also known as Adiala Jail, a facility synonymous with Pakistan's most dangerous and high-profile inmates.
Imran Khan has remained incarcerated since August 2023, following convictions in a web of corruption cases. The prison that holds him is notorious for housing everyone from extremists and terrorists, crime syndicate heads, foreign convicts, death-row prisoners and the country's most prominent political figures.
The jail's reputation is tied not only to its present but also to its past. In April 1979, former prime minister Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto was executed within the complex. After his death, General Zia-ul-Haq modernised the facility, adding sports grounds, rehabilitation initiatives and educational programmes.
According to Punjab Prisons Department figures, Adiala was designed for just 1,900 inmates but now holds roughly 6,000 people, including women.The Dawnhas compared the jail to Delhi's Tihar, noting that both carry a similar notoriety and have experienced significant security lapses over the years.
Overcrowding has forced thousands of prisoners into poorly ventilated, dim cells where disease, malnutrition and even death are threats. Despite jail rules mandating meals with meat, rice and dessert, the reality is different.
Food quality is often substandard due to faulty contracts.
One inmate told Dawn, ""The meat reeks of diesel rather than cooking oil. Drinking water is supplied through bore wells which makes the inmates susceptible to numerous diseases.""
Following requests from prison officials, the district administration suspended mobile services in a five-kilometre radius, extending as far as the nearby village of Gorakhpur. Local settlements are routinely searched for potential suspects.
Adiala's notoriety once drew international notice when Prince Charles visited the prison while Mirza Tahir, a British national on death row, awaited execution. His punishment was later reduced to life by then-president Pervez Musharraf, after which he was repatriated.
Imran Khan's sisters -- Noreen Niazi, Aleema Khan and Dr Uzma Khan -- earlier alleged that they had been unable to meet him for over three weeks and that they were ""brutally"" assaulted outside the facility while attempting to visit.
For two days, Khan dominated online discussion after an Afghan outlet claimed the former PM had died in custody. The Afghanistan Times alleged the 72-year-old leader ""succumbed to alleged mistreatment"" and that his body had been removed from the prison.
Jail authorities countered the report, saying, ""There is no truth to reports about his transfer from Adiala jail. He is fully healthy and receiving complete medical attention.""
Government officials also rejected the claims, and Khan's sister Aleema Khan, along with PTI supporters, ended their sit-in once police assured them that visits would be arranged.
Since his arrest, Khan's children, Qasim and Suleman, who reside in London, have repeatedly expressed alarm over his conditions. Speaking to The Independent, Qasim said, ""The conditions my father is kept in are extremely harsh. He is confined to what is effectively a death cell, with poor hygiene and no proper facilities. For almost a year now, he has not been allowed to see his personal doctor.""
In October, PTI leaders alleged that the former PM had been held in ""solitary confinement,"" adding that, ""Unlike the rest of the prisoners, the cell door of Imran Khan remains shut at all times and he is denied any human contact.""
The party further claimed his electricity supply had been cut, newspapers withheld and television service disconnected for seven months. Khan has also reportedly been barred from speaking to his children.
According to the PTI, ""All of this is not only unlawful but also in violation of prison regulations.""

https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/hong-kong-inferno-puts-spotlight-on-risky-bamboo-scaffolding-9707456?pfrom=home-ndtvworld_world_featured_articles,Hong Kong Inferno Puts Spotlight On Risky Bamboo Scaffolding,"Thu, 27 Nov 2025 13:00:19 +0530","Hong Kong's deadliest fire in three decades has spotlighted its risky use of flammable bamboo scaffolding and mesh for building work in a tradition dating back centuries to mainland China.
The origin of the blaze was unclear, but there was no hiding the ease with which the fire rapidly spread across the green netting and sent bamboo lattices crashing to the ground in flames.
At least 55 people died.
For decades in the skyscraper-strewn former British colony, bamboo has been the material of choice for scaffolding - cheap, abundant and flexible - bound together with nylon cords.
The craft originated on mainland China where bamboo, viewed as symbolising grace and moral fortitude, has since ancient times been a cornerstone of architecture, even reputedly used for scaffolding and tools in the building of the Great Wall.
Now, though, it has largely been phased out there for sturdier metal scaffolding and clamps. But Hong Kong, despite its modernity, still has around 2,500 registered bamboo scaffolding masters plying their trade, according to official figures.
The number of metal scaffolders is around triple that.
Small teams of scaffolders scrambling up vertiginous gleaming facades to sheathe a building in a matter of weeks is an iconic sight in the global financial hub.
The bamboo lattices are also often used alongside green construction mesh to prevent debris from injuring passers-by, as was the case in the tower blocks at the Wang Fuk Court housing complex in Hong Kong's northern Tai Po district.
Hong Kong's leader John Lee said a task force had been set up to investigate the cause of the blaze.
""Buildings Departments' independent review unit will investigate whether the building's exterior walls meet the fire retardant standard,"" he told a press conference.
""If there's any wrongdoing we'll pursue accountability in accordance with laws and regulations.""
SCAFFOLDING CHECKS PROMISED
He also said the government will take special action against ongoing projects, checking whether scaffolding mesh materials meet fire retardant standards and other safety standards.
In March, the government said 50% of new public works contracts would be required to use metal scaffolding going forward.
But the emphasis appeared to be more on worker safety rather than fire risks. There were 22 deaths involving bamboo scaffolders between 2019 and 2024, according to official figures.
Despite the safety push, Hong Kong's secretary for labour Chris Sun said in July that ""the government has no intention to ban the use of bamboo scaffolds at the moment.""
In October, a massive bamboo scaffolding caught fire at the Chinachem Tower in the Central business district. Again, fire consumed construction netting and bamboo poles, leaving windows burnt out and external walls badly seared.
The Association for the Rights of Industrial Accident Victims in Hong Kong said in a Facebook post that there had been at least two other fires involving bamboo scaffolding this year.
Protective nets, screens and tarpaulin or plastic sheeting installed on the face of scaffolding ""should have appropriate fire retardant properties in compliance with a recognised standard,"" says the Hong Kong Labour Department's Code of Practice for Bamboo Scaffolding Safety.
Jason Poon, a whistle-blower who has previously exposed shoddy construction work in Hong Kong, said in a Facebook post on Wednesday that fire hazard risks existed in scaffolding at many housing complexes.
He said he had reached out to various government departments last year concerning the lack of fire retardant in scaffolding nets at another complex, but he was ignored.
Reuters received no immediate response from the fire, buildings and labour departments to a request to comment.

The challenge is the first against India's antitrust penalty law that since last year allows the Competition Commission of India (CCI) to use global turnover when calculating the penalties it imposes on companies for abusing their market dominance.
Since 2022, Tinder-owner Match and Indian startups have been locked in an antitrust battle with Apple at the CCI, where investigators last year issued a report saying the US smartphone company had engaged in ""abusive conduct"" on the apps market of its iPhone Operating System, iOS.
Apple denied all wrongdoing, and the CCI is yet to make a final decision in the case, including about any penalty.
The company is asking judges to declare as illegal the 2024 law that allowed the CCI to use global turnover, not just that in India, when calculating penalties, according to its 545-page court filing, which is not public.
Apple's ""maximum penalty exposure"" at the rate of 10% of its average global turnover derived from all of its services globally for three fiscal years to 2024 could be around $38 billion, it said in the filing.
Such a ""penalty based on global turnover...would be manifestly arbitrary, unconstitutional, grossly disproportionate, unjust,"" it added.
Apple and the CCI did not respond to requests for comment.
Companies also risk fines of as much as 10% of their global turnover for antitrust violations in the European Union.
Apple cited the CCI's use of the new rules for the first time on November 10 in an unrelated case, where they were retrospectively applied to a violation by the affected company a decade earlier.
Apple has ""no choice but to bring this constitutional challenge now to avoid retrospective imposition of penalty against them,"" it argued.
The company has maintained it is a small player compared to Google's Android, which is the dominant player in the Indian market.
Apple's smartphone base has, however, become four times larger in the last five years in India, according to Counterpoint Research.
The CCI found last year that Apple was not permitting any third-party payment processor to provide services for in-app purchases, where the fee could be up to 30%.
In a private submission to the CCI, reported by Reuters in October, Apple opponent Match argued a fine based on global turnover could ""act as a significant deterrent against recidivism"".
In its court filing, Apple argued India should only impose a penalty based on the Indian revenue of the specific unit which violates antitrust law, giving an example of a toy seller running a stationery business.
It would be arbitrary and disproportionate to levy a penalty on the stationery business's total turnover of 20,000 rupees, when the contravention is only in relation to the toy business that earns 100 rupees, it said.
Apple's plea will be heard on December 3.
""Amended law is clear that CCI can consider global turnover,"" said Gautam Shahi, a competition law partner at Indian law firm Dua Associates. ""It will be difficult to convince the court to interfere with clearly laid down legislative policy.""

Conservation Minister Tama Potaka described feral cats as ""stone cold killers"" and confirmed they will be added to the Predator Free 2050 list, a program launched in 2016 to target invasive species that threaten birds, bats, lizards, and insects, according toCNN.
Feral cats are wild hunters that live independently of humans, unlike pet cats, surviving entirely by hunting, Potaka explained. To preserve New Zealand's unique biodiversity, which is home to several species found nowhere else on Earth, it is necessary to control their population.
They are wild hunters and kill native species, such as the Pukunui (Southern dotterel) on Rakiura, Stewart Island, which is now nearly extinct.
Potaka also noted that in one week, over 100 short-tailed bats were killed by feral cats near Ohakune on the North Island, and they have also pushed the southern dotterel bird on Stewart Island almost to extinction.
Over 2.5 million feral cats are living in New Zealand's forests and on offshore islands, which can grow up to 1 metre long (including the tail) and weigh up to 7 kg.
""Feral cats are now found across Aotearoa New Zealand, from farms to forests, and they put huge pressure on native birds, bats, lizards and insects,"" Potaka stated. Along with wild hunting, feral cats can spread diseases, as they carry toxoplasmosis, which can harm dolphins, affect human health and cause financial losses to farmers by infecting livestock.
""New Zealand is full of proud cat owners, and domestic pets are not part of this Predator Free target,"" Potaka added.
New Zealand's Predator-Free 2050 strategy is a government-led initiative aimed at eliminating invasive predators that threaten native wildlife. Since its inception, it has successfully targeted species such as ferrets, stoats, weasels, rats and possums.
""For the first time, a predator is being added to the list and will join other mammals,"" he said, adding that removing feral cats will boost biodiversity, preserve heritage landscapes, and maintain New Zealand's ecological identity, according toThe Guardian.
The Department of Conservation (DOC) is testing a new way to control feral cats using meat-based bait, according toThe Gulf News.
They will first use a harmless bait to attract the cats, followed by a poisoned bait containing 1080, a chemical used to kill other pests. However, the approach is controversial because it could harm other animals.
The DOC is planning ways to reduce feral cats, and by March 2026, will release a detailed strategy.

Dmitry Nuyanzin, 30, from the Russian city of Orenburg, died in his sleep as he attempted to promote his weight-loss programme through the eating challenge, where he aimed to gain at least 25 kg.
Nuyanzin spent weeks consuming junk food as part of a 'marathon' challenge he hoped would inspire his clients to shed weight alongside him. He consumed upwards of 10,000 calories a day and was planning to shed it all over to show his transformation, according to a report inPeople.
A day prior to his death, Nuyanzin cancelled training sessions, informing friends that he was feeling unwell and planned on seeing a doctor. According to the report, Nuyanzin's heart failed as he slept.
Nuyanzin's last Instagram post, dated November 18, showed him eating a pack of Lays whilst revealing that he now weighed 105 kg, having gained at least 13 kg in a month.

Reacting to Nuyanzin's death, social media users expressed their condolences to the family, whilst stating that his story was a lesson to others attempting similar challenges.
""It is better to prove such theories not in practice. Rest in peace,"" said one user, while another added: ""It's true. If you're not used to junky fries fast food it will indeed make you sick!""
A third commented: ""Well, if ever there was a cautionary tale, then this has to be it.""
A fourth said: ""An excellent coach and a wonderful mentor, and just a good person. The news was shocking. Condolences to the family.""
His dramatic, high-calorie daily diet included pastries and cake for breakfast; dumplings smothered in mayonnaise for lunch; and a burger with two small pizzas for dinner.
""For breakfast, I have a plate of pastries and half a cake. For lunch, I usually eat 800 grams [nearly 2 lbs.] of dumplings with mayonnaise,"" he'd said. ""During the day, I may snack on crisps, and for dinner, I have a burger and two small pizzas, either at a cafe or delivered.""

The traps belonged to the Heiltsuk Nation, an indigenous community. They set these traps to control the European green crab, an invasive species harming local animals and plants. This programme is part of their environmental conservation efforts.
Kyle Artelle, an assistant professor at the State University of New York College of Environmental Science and Forestry and co-author of a new study,said, ""The traps were starting to get damaged, and the damage did look like it could have been a bear or a wolf.
Researchers initially assumed that deep-water traps could not be accessed by wolves or bears because these animals do not dive.
The study showed that some crab traps are set in shallow water, where a bear or wolf could easily reach them. Other traps, however, are in deep water. Even when the tide is at its lowest, they're underwater and not easy to reach. ""The assumption was it couldn't be a bear or a wolf, because they don't dive. So, who could it be?""
To identify this, researchers placed cameras to see and identify the animal getting the crab traps. They thought it might be an otter or a seal. Instead, the camera showed a wolf swimming to shore carrying a floating buoy in her mouth.
She dropped the buoy on the sand and grabbed the rope attached to it. Next, using the rope, she pulled the crab trap out of the water. Later, the wolf dragged the trap to a shallow spot and opened it to eat the bait, a piece of herring.
Incredible. This wolf sees a buoy out in deep water and recognizes it's attached to a crab trap filled with food as bait. She swims over to the buoy and pulls it to shore, knowing it'll drag the trap w/ bait out, too. Voila, free meal.Animals use tools, just like us.pic.twitter.com/Sf55r8XS4g
""We were amazed. It was not what we were expecting, to say the least,"" said Artelle, highlighting that the wolves might have learned about the traps either by watching humans drop them from boats, or by first finding them in shallow water when the tide was low and then figuring out how to get traps that were deeper.
""It's a sequence of behaviours that ultimately gets her towards that goal. It's problem-solving, and it's problem-solving exactly the way humans do it,"" he added.
Artelle says the wolf's actions seem very deliberate. Even though the trap was underwater and she couldn't see it, she wasn't just pulling randomly or playing around. Instead, she had a clear plan. She even stared at the end of the rope, watching carefully for when the trap would appear.
""Future research will answer questions about whether other wolves also learn to use a rope and whether this behavior becomes culturally transmitted within this population,"" said Marc Bekoff, an animal behavior expert and emeritus professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at the University of Colorado.

https://www.ndtvprofit.com/economy-finance/8th-pay-commission-how-higher-fitment-factor-can-lift-markets-jp-morgan-explains?pfrom=home-world_ndtvprofit,No headline found,No date/time found,"The 8th Pay Commission, which will result in a significant hike in the salaries and allowances of central government employees, is also seen as one of the key factors potentially contributing to the upward climb of the Indian stock market, according to a note released by JPMorgan.
The multinational bank, in its research report dated Nov. 26, explained that8th Pay Commissionwill lead to ""consumption acceleration"", which in turn will be a key factor ""shaping the markets"" in coming years.
A jump in consumption will boost the earnings of India Inc., and healthier bottom lines are generally considered as crucial in attracting institutional investors to the Indian markets.
This 8th Pay Commission-powered consumption story, however, hinges on thefitment factoror the multiplication unit used for salary revision.
The commission, headed by Justice (retired) Ranjana Desai, will meet various stakeholders over the next several months before submitting its report to the Centre. The report will include the proposed fitment factor and other modalities for salary revision.
The panel,formally constitutedin early November, has been given an 18-month deadline by the government to submit its report.
A higher fitment factor will lead to a sharper revision in salaries and pensions, which will in turn boost the disposable income of over 1 crore central government employees and pensioners.
In 2016, however, the 7th Pay Commission's fitment factor led to a ""smaller 23–25% salary hike with minimal arrears"", leading to a ""more moderate boost in everyday spending"", it added.
Notably, the fitment factor recommended by the 7th Pay Commission was 2.57, which was higher as compared to what was implemented under the 6th Pay Commission. However, the effective wage hike was lower as the dearness allowance, which stood at 125% of the basic pay in 2016, was reset to zero.
Currently, the DA stands 58%, and is expected to at least cross 65% of the basic pay by the time the 8th Pay Commission comes into effect. Since theDA componentwill be much lower as compared to what it stood in 2016, a lower fitment factor can also result in a sharper real-wage growth for employees.
JPMorgan, citing media reports, said it sees a fiscal impact of $42 billion to $44 billion (Rs 3.7 lakh crore to Rs 3.9 lakh crore) on account of 8th Pay Commission's implementation. This will be significantly higher as compared to the estimated impact of Rs 1.02 lakh crore on the exchequer back in 2017, following the 7th Pay Commission's rollout.
This $42–44 billion bonanza may ""stimulate demand in consumer sectors such as automobiles, consumer durables, and potentially mid/low income housing"", JPMorgan said.
""The consumption boost may be especially pronounced in Tier II and III cities, where the largest proportion of government employees reside,"" it added.",2025-11-28 20:33:47,world,Positive
https://www.ndtvprofit.com/personal-finance/rs-8000-monthly-sip-vs-rs-2-lakh-lump-sum-who-reaches-rs-50-lakh-first?pfrom=home-world_ndtvprofit,No headline found,No date/time found,"With the evolving financial services landscape in India, investors are exploring more rewarding investment options compared to traditional secure instruments like fixed deposits. Mutual funds have become popular among investors in recent years as they provide enormous flexibility and potentially higher returns. However, it’s a common dilemma for many mutual fund investors to choose between a Systematic Investment Plan (SIP) and a lump sum investment for building a sizable corpus.
Both SIPs and lump sum investments come with their benefits and risks and the returns could significantly vary due to multiple factors. Suppose you want to build a corpus of Rs 50 lakh, and you can choose between investing Rs 2 lakh lump sum or starting a monthly SIP of Rs 8,000, which investment route should you take?
To answer this question, let’s see through calculations how your money will grow in both scenarios.
Both SIP and lump sum investments could be helpful in reaching the Rs 50 lakh goal conveniently. However, the investment tenure may vary significantly.
Here’s a look at the expected growth of your investments over a fixed period to reach the target of Rs 50 lakh at an assumed return of 12% per annum:
Rs 8,000 monthly SIP:
Monthly investment: Rs 8,000
Tenure: 17 years
Total investment: Rs 16.32 lakh
Expected returns: 12%
Estimated returns: Rs 37.11 lakh
Maturity corpus: Rs 53.43 lakh
Investing In A Mutual Fund Lump Sum:
Total investment: Rs 2 lakh
Tenure: 29 years
Expected returns: 12%
Estimated returns: Rs 51.5 lakh
Maturity corpus: Rs 53.5 lakh
It’s important to note that the rate of return can vary due to market conditions and other factors from what has been shown in the above calculations.
At an assumed interest rate of 12% per annum, a monthly SIP of Rs 8,000 can help an investor to reach the target of Rs 50 lakh faster compared to a lump sum investment of Rs 2 lakh.
Over the long run, the SIP investor is committing a significantly higher total amount. After just two years, the SIP investor would have contributed a total of Rs 1,92,000, almost matching the lump sum investment. This difference in total contribution is the key factor in achieving the goal of Rs 50 lakh.
As seen from the above calculation, an investor can reach the target of Rs 50 lakh in 17 years with a monthly SIP of Rs 8,000. However, a lump sum investment of Rs 2 lakh is expected to grow into Rs 13.73 lakh during the same tenure. It will take 29 years for an investor to hit the target of Rs 50 lakh with a lump sum investment of Rs 2 lakh.

The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) is reportedly displeased with the coach's recent press conference remarks, compounding the scrutiny already mounting over his controversial team methods. According to a report, though Gambhir has the board's backing at present, things could change quickly if India's T20 World Cup 2026 performances at home are affected
Following the crushing defeat, Gambhir's post-match press conference has become a focal point of contention. While publicly accepting collective responsibility, the coach's defiant stance and his perceived attempt to shift blame or offer contradictions have not gone down well with the BCCI hierarchy.
According to a report in theHindustan Times, Gambhir's forthright comments, particularly on the pitch conditions after the Kolkata Test, were seen as adding unnecessary fuel to the fire. The report suggests the Board is unhappy with the tone and content of his public statements, adding a layer of off-field drama to the team's on-field slump.
As the public sentiment increasingly turns against Gambhir, the head coach doesn't have a lot of time before the board turns its back on him, too.
India's Test record, especially at home, has been the primary concern for the top bosses. Under Gambhir's leadership, the team has suffered multiple home series defeats, an unthinkable scenario for Indian cricket under Gambhir's predecessors likeRahul DravidandRavi Shastri.
A major point of criticism from former players and experts is Gambhir's over-reliance on all-rounders/part-timers at the expense of specialist batters and bowlers. This tactical approach is believed to have sacrificed stability and depth, undermining the foundation required for success in the five-day format.
The pressure from dismal performances in the red-ball format is rising on Gambhir, and it won't be long before he loses the backing he currently has. India are not scheduled to play a home Test series until August 2026, hence, the BCCI is not keen to dismiss the coach from the Test format just yet.
Gambhir's success as the team's white-ball coach does play a role in the confidence the BCCI has in him. But the coach needs to keep the pendulum swinging in the T20 World Cup, too.

They feature his wife, actress Priyanka Chopra and daughter Malti Marie Jonas. From the possibility of a duet with PeeCee to Maltie's holistic upbringing, the singer-actor has spilled it all.
Nick Jonas recently appeared on SiriusXM's Andy Cohen Live podcast. He was accompanied by actress, singer  Adrienne Warre. The duo has worked together in the Broadway musicalThe Last Five Years.
During the conversation, the host wanted to know whether Nick Jonas was planning on collaborating with Priyanka Chopra for a song. To this, the actor had a befitting reply.
Nick Jonas said, “I don't know. She's an amazing singer and she's shooting a movie in India right now and she's travelling back and forth to the US. I think our best duet is probably our little girl. She's 3.
In another segment, Nick Jonas heaped praises on Priyanka Chopra for her unwavering support.  She's in nursery school, she's in karate class, got her first belt.”
He said, “Having a partner that's not only supportive of your ambition and your desire to do a good job, but genuinely just shows up and comes to cheer you is a dream scenario.”
Nick Jonas added that his wife also offered him suggestions to improve his performance inThe Last Five Years.
He said, “We talk a lot about work, and before Adrienne and I started rehearsing, I certainly was singing the music around the house and talking and probably pontificating for longer than I should have. But that's the beauty of this partnership and frankly, the thing I'm most grateful for about our marriage is the ability to share, kind of, life together and a humongous part of both of our lives is our work.”
Nick Jonas added, “It does naturally sort of become one thing, one mind, one thought. And so it's probably not framed as notes, but just like, ‘Here's some thoughts, let's workshop that a bit'.”

Nick Jonas and Priyanka Chopra got married in 2018. The couple welcomed Malti Marie Jonas in 2022 via surrogacy.

Things got so intense that Ashish Hemrajani, CEO and Founder of BookMyShow, was even summoned by the police.
Now, Ashish has finally opened up about the chaos during a panel discussion with NDTV at the World Audio Visual and Entertainment Summit. He was joined by Viraf Sarkari, Co-founder of Wizcraft International Entertainment and Vivien Lewit, Global Head of Artists at YouTube.
Addressing the issue,Ashish Hemrajanisaid, “There were a lot of things that were said during the booking phase about us. I think that is a little bit of maturity that is needed in the market. We are 1.4 billion Indians. It's a huge country. We had millions of people that were in the queue, trying to buy. In Bombay, it was 50,000 into threeshows– that is 150,000. In Ahmedabad, it was about 110,000 into two shows – that is 220,000 tickets.”
“So we are talking about 370,000 tickets. Now, you know, there was a lot that was said. The queue was transparent. The token numbers were transparent. We have every customer's email ID, mobile number, device ID, transaction ID, and home address because we deliver the tickets to your home,” he added.
Talking about the band's massive popularity and backing up the math behind the overwhelming ticket demand, Ashish Hemrajani said, “So the supply-demand — if you see the numbers on YouTube today, you see the numbers of streaming for a band like Coldplay. They are the world's biggest band. They are the highest-ticketed band.”
“We have a large population, which is now a discerning, young demographic, which has disposable income. Where does the math go wrong? It's just that somebody didn't look at it. The appetite is there. The math is very much there,” he concluded.
For the unversed, Coldplay had a total of five concerts in India between January 18 and 26. When the tickets went live on BookMyShow in September, millions of people flooded the platform, trying to book their spots. In no time, tickets were being resold on other sites at insanely inflated prices.
Although BookMyShow claimed it had no involvement in the black market and even filed a police complaint to support that, the Economic Offences Wing (EOW) of the Mumbai Police still summoned CEO Ashish Hemrajani to explain what went wrong.NDTV is at the inaugural edition of the Waves Summit, currently on at the Jio World Centre in Mumbai.

Addressing the WAVES 2025, Nagarjuna stated there is a reason why Allu Arjun'sPushpafranchise earned more in Hindi than Telugu, as the audience in the North was craving to see stars in a tentpole movie set-up, like the Sukumar directorial or Yash's blockbusterKGFseries.
""Both thePushpafilms made more money in the North than in Telugu. We have seen similar stories in Telugu before, likePushpa, which has larger-than-life heroes. Whereas in the North—in Bihar, UP, and Punjab—they wanted to see their heroes like Pushpa Raj, Yash inKGForBaahubali. They wanted to see larger-than-life heroes. For Indian people and culture, just living day to day is difficult, and when they want to overcome the stress by watching films, they want to see magic on screen,"" he said.
TheBangarrajuactress added, ""That's what the larger-than-life stories are doing, without losing the fundamentals of Indian storytelling. They are not going away from that, which is why they have been successful. Rajamouli shotBaahubaliframe to frame, thinking it is a Telugu film. He was very proud of his roots and language, and he shot it like a Telugu film, and people loved it across the world! If you are rooted in your storytelling, it will resonate.""
Nagarjuna said that Indian films have their own, unique storytelling DNA, which one must be proud of.
""You might say, 'A guy raises his fist and 20 people fall, it looks abnormal!' But if you likeMarvelorDCfilms, Superman does the same thing, but they give the logic of them having 'super powers.' But we don't need those special powers! The common man, the ticket-paying audience, including me, wants to watch my heroes larger-than-life. When I see Prabhas, Allu Arjun, and others going on screen and doing what they do, I clap and whistle"", theBrahmastraactor concluded.
Nagarjuna was speaking on the panel discussion 'Pan-Indian Cinema; Myth Or Momentum?,' where he was joined by actors Anupam Kher, Khusbhu, and Karthi.

But the ambition, according to key industry voices, must go beyond replicating old formulas. It requires identifying gaps, thinking hyper-locally, and scaling creatively for international relevance.
Speaking to NDTV's Editor-in-Chief, Sanjay Pugalia, on the second day of the World Audio Visual and Entertainment Summit (WAVES), Gaurav Gandhi, Vice President of Amazon Prime Video, reflected on the platform's eight-year journey in India.
He said, ""Our journey with Prime Video India has been over eight years. It's been amazing for us - full of learning and a lot of love from customers."" He added, ""When we started, we realised that to make an impact in India, you have to think local. As a market and as a country, we are so diverse that there's no single definition of 'local'. So, we had to think in multiple ways - local tastes, local languages, local milieu.""
This approach, he said, was rooted in identifying what the Indian ecosystem lacked. He shared, ""The first gap was the absence of high cinematic-value storytelling in India, which was already present internationally. The second gap was in movies - while we made a lot of them, there weren't enough theatres to screen them. The third was that everyone was locked into their own language. Keeping these three things in mind, we tried to bridge the gaps.""
Filmmaker Vikramaditya Motwane pointed out how the rise of streaming platforms has given creators the freedom they didn't have 10 to 15 years ago.
He stated, ""From where we were 10-15 years ago - when there was only one format and films were made only for the big screen - to now, the landscape has changed entirely,"" he said. ""Platforms like Prime Video and other streaming services have given creators the freedom to think beyond just a two-hour film in a theatre. Now you can make a crime series with multiple seasons and episodes. You can do a comedy series, something like Jubilee or Mumbai Diaries - there's so much freedom to tell stories.""
Motwane believes India is still in the early stages of this shift. He added, ""We're at a stage where filmmakers are discovering this freedom and just going for it. But I don't think we've reached the point where we've fully taken advantage of it yet. When that happens, the next step will be to create stories that not only work in India but also travel globally. That's when we'll truly enter the next generation of Indian storytelling,"" he said. ""Ten to fifteen years ago, people thought Indian content meant only Bollywood. That stereotype has broken, and over time, it will continue to break with different types of shows, films, and creators.""
Director Nikkhil Advani, who is currently busy with his upcoming revolutionaries, believes that historical storytelling must feel alive, not academic. ""Whenever you're working on something related to a historical period, the richer and more authentic the material, the better the starting point,"" he said. ""I did Rocket Boys, and now I'm working on Revolutionaries. It's always about the source material,"" he said.
Advani's approach is clear: entertain first, educate later. ""In the case of Revolutionaries, I'm having a lot of fun making it. The first thing I say is, 'Let's make revolutionaries sexy. Let's have fun with it.' Because if you give people a history lesson, their reaction is usually, 'nahi sunna hai, nahi dekhna hai' (don't want to listen, don't want to watch),"" he concluded.

Speaking to NDTV's Editor-in-Chief, Sanjay Pugalia, on the second day of the World Audio Visual and Entertainment Summit (WAVES), Aamir Khan highlighted the vast potential for collaboration between the two countries in cinema and creative content.
Aamir was on a panel named ""Indian Cinema, Oriental Look"" alongside Peter Ho Sun Chan, Stanley Tong and Prasad Shetty.
The spotlight was on Aamir, whose films - particularlyDangal(2016) - have seen phenomenal success in the Chinese market.
Offering insight into the emotional resonance between the two nations' audiences, Khan said, ""I've had the opportunity to visit China quite a few times over the last 6-10 years, and there's a lot I'd like to share. The audiences in China - their cultural sensibilities and emotional responses - are remarkably similar to those in India. From my experience, the way Chinese audiences reacted to my films, especiallyDangal, was almost identical to how Indian audiences responded. The emotions were universal.""
The actor went on to outline the creative and business opportunities such partnerships could bring. He shared, ""I truly believe there is immense potential here, for several reasons. First, India has a vibrant and dynamic creative community - and so does China. I've witnessed their events and films, and the quality of their work is truly world-class.""
He added, ""Whether from a creative, emotional, or business perspective, I think it's a win-win if we collaborate. Over the years, I've had many discussions with my friends from China about exploring these possibilities. Now, with initiatives like WAVES gaining momentum, this collaboration will likely get an even stronger push.""
""India and China are both ancient civilisations with rich histories and cultures. There's so much we can offer each other. I genuinely look forward to collaborating with creative talent from China,"" he concluded.
Aamir's statement comes at a time when India is aiming to position itself as a global content hub under the vision of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has repeatedly emphasised the importance of soft power in global diplomacy.

The makers of the K-drama recently unveiled a teaser that hints at a thrilling mix of adrenaline, emotion and second chances as Olympic athletes trade gold medals for police badges.
The 50-second teaser kicks off on a triumphant note, spotlighting each character's athletic glory.
Park Bo Gum is introduced as boxing champion Yoon Dong Joo, Kim So Hyun stuns as a sharpshooting prodigy, and Lee Sang Yi's fencing finesse is on full display. Joined by Heo Sung Tae and Tae Won Suk, the team is a force of sporting excellence.
But the teaser quickly pivots. Gone are the cheers and confetti - instead, viewers are plunged into a world of broken dreams and odd jobs.
From a restless Dong Joo sitting alone in a rundown car to a mascot-suited discus thrower trudging through monotony, the visuals reflect the weight of dashed hopes.

Recently in a conversation with Vickey Lalwani, the actress revealed why she would not agree to play Shah Rukh Khan's mother on screen.
Mumtaz spoke about her rule that to play someone's mother on the big screen, the age gap has to be of 20 years.
She said, ""I'll only play a mom to an actor who is 20 years younger than me, and that, too, provided I look good on screen.""
She further revealed how she got married at a very young age, and that appearances matter a lot for her at this juncture, when she is picking and choosing scripts she would like to be a part of.
On being further probed about why Mumtaz would not be ready to be Shah Rukh Khan's mother onscreen when veteran actresses like Jaya Bachchan have already done it, she said, ""That's Jaya's decision.""
She further added, ""Tell Shah Rukh I'll work with him if I can look like I actually do. But he'll say no. Why should I have grey hair? He's very intelligent, very smart, and a lovely person. Just because he likes me doesn't mean he'd cast me if I don't look the part.""
Mumtaz expressed her admiration for Hollywood legend Jane Fonda and her performance inMother-in-Law.
She said, ""Her character didn't want to accept a girl who was 'gareeb' (poor). She had the freedom to look and dress the way she wanted. That's something I'd like too.""
For the unversed, years ago, Shah Rukh Khan confessed at a press meet that his first two crushes were Mumtaz and Saira Banu, calling them the most beautiful women in the world.
Some of Mumtaz's most popular films includeBandhan, Aadmi Aur Insaan, Sachaa Jhutha, Khilona, Tere Mere Sapne, Hare Rama Hare Krishna, Chor Machaye Shor, Aap Ki Kasam, Roti, and Prem Kahani.

From Raashii Khanna and Vaani Kapoor, Kareena Kapoor Khan and Amrita Rao, Sonakshi Sinha and Huma Qureshi, to name a few, strong female friendships have been the new trend in the film industry for a while now.
Mouni Roy who is currently busy with the promotions of her upcoming filmBhootnii, was asked about her friendship with Disha Patani. The two have been spotted several times at dinners and luxurious holidays. They also hype each other up on social media and keep sharing several pictures.
Reacting to the same, Mouni Roy toldNews18, ""Two heroines can definitely be friends. It has got nothing to do with the profession that you're in. You could be a doctor, an engineer or a builder and still find friends. I truly believe that your vibe catches your tribe.""
She added, ""You're operating on a certain energy level and if you find somebody matching that same energy, you'll bond. It has got nothing to do with the profession. There's nothing like women friendship. Sisterhood is very important to me. Having a group of women who're your thick friends is like your entire family. You can find a mother, a father, a brother, and a sister in them.""
Mouni will be seen with Palak Tiwari inBhootnii. Earlier Palak had heaped praises on Mouni and how wonderful she is to work with, and the joy of having a good bond with female co-stars.
Reacting to the same, Mouni said, ""If there's any unpleasantry, a negative vibe or you not getting along with your female co-actor, it gets very difficult to work and say the dialogues with that person. And in that process, the honesty of the craft gets lost. I'm glad we met each other through the making of this project. We genuinely like each other and each other's company. We gave one another the space when necessary but at the same time, we could come together, sit down and joke around.""
Bhootniiwas released in theatres on May 1, 2025.

Kareena started her journey way back in 2000 withRefugee, and continues to be a relevant name in the film industry. In the current lieu of actresses, Kareena is still holding her fort.
The actress expressed her love for Bollywood at the WAVES Summit 2025 event, she attended earlier today.
She said, ""Main toh yahin hoon. I'm very happy with my Indian movies. It's so much fun to dance to our Hindi songs and deliver Hindi dialogues.""
She then went on to talk about the impact of Hindi Cinema, abroad, as she spoke about how she had once crossed paths with a driver abroad who was singing Raj Kapoor's iconic songMera Joota Hai Japani.
Kareena shared some gorgeous pictures on Instagram, showing a glimpse of her look for the event.
She captioned it, ""So honoured to be part of a panel discussion at the WAVES Summit, where India isn't just part of the global entertainment conversation, we're driving it. India is fast emerging as a superpower in the global entertainment industry and this is the beginning of a creative movement that will define the future (sic).""
Yesterday Aamir Khan too emphasized on the lack of theatres in India at the WAVES Summit 2025.
He said, ""I have always believed that we have very few theatres for the size of the country and the number of people living in India. In India, we have around 10,000 screens, and in the US, which is one-third of our population, they have 40,000 screens and China has 90,000 screens. And even in this, 10,000, half are in the South and half in the rest of the country. So, for a Hindi film, you have a maximum of 5,000 screens. Our biggest hits over the years, no matter what language, have had a theatrical footfall of three crore people. That's only 2 per cent of our entire population.""
As for Kareena, her last film wasSingham Againwith Ajay Devgn in 2024.

Days after his revelation,Aashiquiactor Anu Aggarwal claimed she also drank urine and got health benefits.
In an interaction with Instant Bollywood, Anu Aggarwal said, ""Many people don't know this... whether it's ignorance or just a lack of awareness, but drinking urine, which is referred to as Aamroli, is actually a mudra (gesture/practice) in Yoga. I've practiced it myself. I have tried it, and it's a very important practice. But one crucial thing to remember is that you don't drink the entire urine. Only a specific part of it is consumed... That portion is considered amrit (elixir). It's known to help with anti-aging, keeping your skin wrinkle-free... it's truly amazing not just for health, but overall well-being. I've personally experienced its benefits.""
When asked about the lack of scientific evidence behind such claim, Anu said, ""Kitni purani hai? (How old is science) 200 years. Yog 10,000 saal se hai, toh kiski baat aap sunenge? (And Yog is 10,000 years old, so who would you listen). I definitely support this.""
A post shared by Instant Bollywood (@instantbollywood)
For the unversed, Paresh Rawal shared that Ajay Devgn's father Veeru Devgn suggested him to drink urine to heal his knee injury faster during an interaction with The Lallantop.
""Veeru Devgan had come to visit when I was in Nanavati (hospital). When he got to know I was there, he came up to me and asked what happened to me? I told him about my leg injury,"" Paresh Rawal said.
""He told me to drink my own urine first thing in the morning. All fighters do this. You will never face any problem, just drink urine first thing in the morning. He told me not to consume alcohol, which I had stopped, mutton or tobacco. He told me to eat regular food and urine in the morning,"" Paresh Rawal recalled.
Paresh Rawal was slammed by Dr Cyriac Abby Philips, who goes by ""The Liver Doc"" on social media. He wrote, ""Please don't drink your urine (or others) because a Bollywood actor says so. There is no scientific evidence to support the idea that drinking urine provides any health benefits"".

Did he expect the performances to have such a lasting impact?
“Yeah, for me, it is really one of the finest performances of Mr. Bachchan. I mean, he just gave everything to the film. And while we were shooting it, I could see it because he was enjoying it so much. Every reading, every scene, every moment, he was taking so much time and joy to do it. He will not leave the set, he will be just there,"" said the director.
Sirar further added, “And some days he will come and do the shots again. No, he just wanted to give his best because he was enjoying it so much. I saw in his eyes, in his behavior, how he was enjoying.”
Shoojit highlighted the cine icon's brilliance in capturing everyday nuances, bringing authenticity, and charm to his character through small, natural moments.
He added, “He would pick up those moments, those small moments with the house help. He was just having a blast there. Telling the neighbour, just being angry at a neighbour who comments. He was just enjoying all that. So, the small things, the way he sits down, the way he eats his food, the way he talks in the dining hall, that is the real joy that is brought in. Absolutely mesmerized by his performance.”
Pikurevolves around an architect named Piku and her ageing but nagging father Bhaskor Banerjee, who come close via a road trip to Kolkata despite their disparate ideologies and fights over trivial issues.
The comedy drama, which is set to clock 10 years since its release, stars Amitabh Bachchan, Deepika Padukone and Irrfan Khan along with Moushumi Chatterjee, Jisshu Sengupta, and Raghubir Yadav.
Piku, which is slated to re-release on May 9, 2025, emphasises on the emotional and moral responsibility of adult children to care for their aging parents, highlighting the challenges of balancing personal life with caregiving.
Asked how he feels the story ofPikuholds relevance today, especially considering the growing number of young adults balancing their personal lives with caring for aging parents, Shoojit toldIANS, “Yeah, caregiving is a very important issue now in our topic. So, parental caregiving is a crisis also at this moment in this modern family structure, which is going on in the society. So this film speaks volumes about that, where you still, you can't just abandon your elders and parents.”
He added, “Piku takes that charge also. Piku says, I mean, you know, 'I cannot just, I'll have to keep them alive. I mean, if they are not, if we don't take care, they won't be alive anymore. So to keep them alive, I will have to be there.' Also when parents grow old, there is a very clear message there in the film that when they get old, they can't live on their own.”
He added, “You will have to be with them so that they can pass through, you know. So that's very important and relevant also in today's time. So, I think Piku, as a very progressive girl from a progressive family, is quite clear about that, which I think is very important to take away fromPiku.”

However, what caught the attention of internet users was that Virat liked the post and then disliked it too. The activity was shared on his fan pages, where people started commenting with, ""Kohlisaabwhat is this behaviour?""
While someone else said, ""Akaaybetapapakophonedo.""

They feature his wife, actress Priyanka Chopra and daughter Malti Marie Jonas. From the possibility of a duet with PeeCee to Maltie's holistic upbringing, the singer-actor has spilled it all.
Nick Jonas recently appeared on SiriusXM's Andy Cohen Live podcast. He was accompanied by actress, singer  Adrienne Warre. The duo has worked together in the Broadway musicalThe Last Five Years.
During the conversation, the host wanted to know whether Nick Jonas was planning on collaborating with Priyanka Chopra for a song. To this, the actor had a befitting reply.
Nick Jonas said, “I don't know. She's an amazing singer and she's shooting a movie in India right now and she's travelling back and forth to the US. I think our best duet is probably our little girl. She's 3.
In another segment, Nick Jonas heaped praises on Priyanka Chopra for her unwavering support.  She's in nursery school, she's in karate class, got her first belt.”
He said, “Having a partner that's not only supportive of your ambition and your desire to do a good job, but genuinely just shows up and comes to cheer you is a dream scenario.”
Nick Jonas added that his wife also offered him suggestions to improve his performance inThe Last Five Years.
He said, “We talk a lot about work, and before Adrienne and I started rehearsing, I certainly was singing the music around the house and talking and probably pontificating for longer than I should have. But that's the beauty of this partnership and frankly, the thing I'm most grateful for about our marriage is the ability to share, kind of, life together and a humongous part of both of our lives is our work.”
Nick Jonas added, “It does naturally sort of become one thing, one mind, one thought. And so it's probably not framed as notes, but just like, ‘Here's some thoughts, let's workshop that a bit'.”

Nick Jonas and Priyanka Chopra got married in 2018. The couple welcomed Malti Marie Jonas in 2022 via surrogacy.

Things got so intense that Ashish Hemrajani, CEO and Founder of BookMyShow, was even summoned by the police.
Now, Ashish has finally opened up about the chaos during a panel discussion with NDTV at the World Audio Visual and Entertainment Summit. He was joined by Viraf Sarkari, Co-founder of Wizcraft International Entertainment and Vivien Lewit, Global Head of Artists at YouTube.
Addressing the issue,Ashish Hemrajanisaid, “There were a lot of things that were said during the booking phase about us. I think that is a little bit of maturity that is needed in the market. We are 1.4 billion Indians. It's a huge country. We had millions of people that were in the queue, trying to buy. In Bombay, it was 50,000 into threeshows– that is 150,000. In Ahmedabad, it was about 110,000 into two shows – that is 220,000 tickets.”
“So we are talking about 370,000 tickets. Now, you know, there was a lot that was said. The queue was transparent. The token numbers were transparent. We have every customer's email ID, mobile number, device ID, transaction ID, and home address because we deliver the tickets to your home,” he added.
Talking about the band's massive popularity and backing up the math behind the overwhelming ticket demand, Ashish Hemrajani said, “So the supply-demand — if you see the numbers on YouTube today, you see the numbers of streaming for a band like Coldplay. They are the world's biggest band. They are the highest-ticketed band.”
“We have a large population, which is now a discerning, young demographic, which has disposable income. Where does the math go wrong? It's just that somebody didn't look at it. The appetite is there. The math is very much there,” he concluded.
For the unversed, Coldplay had a total of five concerts in India between January 18 and 26. When the tickets went live on BookMyShow in September, millions of people flooded the platform, trying to book their spots. In no time, tickets were being resold on other sites at insanely inflated prices.
Although BookMyShow claimed it had no involvement in the black market and even filed a police complaint to support that, the Economic Offences Wing (EOW) of the Mumbai Police still summoned CEO Ashish Hemrajani to explain what went wrong.NDTV is at the inaugural edition of the Waves Summit, currently on at the Jio World Centre in Mumbai. The event brings together the who's who of showbiz, creators, and everyone who's anyone in the world of entertainment in India and beyond. Catch all updates on NDTV.com, from May 1 to May 4.

Addressing the WAVES 2025, Nagarjuna stated there is a reason why Allu Arjun'sPushpafranchise earned more in Hindi than Telugu, as the audience in the North was craving to see stars in a tentpole movie set-up, like the Sukumar directorial or Yash's blockbusterKGFseries.
""Both thePushpafilms made more money in the North than in Telugu. We have seen similar stories in Telugu before, likePushpa, which has larger-than-life heroes. Whereas in the North—in Bihar, UP, and Punjab—they wanted to see their heroes like Pushpa Raj, Yash inKGForBaahubali. They wanted to see larger-than-life heroes. For Indian people and culture, just living day to day is difficult, and when they want to overcome the stress by watching films, they want to see magic on screen,"" he said.
TheBangarrajuactress added, ""That's what the larger-than-life stories are doing, without losing the fundamentals of Indian storytelling. They are not going away from that, which is why they have been successful. Rajamouli shotBaahubaliframe to frame, thinking it is a Telugu film. He was very proud of his roots and language, and he shot it like a Telugu film, and people loved it across the world! If you are rooted in your storytelling, it will resonate.""
Nagarjuna said that Indian films have their own, unique storytelling DNA, which one must be proud of.
""You might say, 'A guy raises his fist and 20 people fall, it looks abnormal!' But if you likeMarvelorDCfilms, Superman does the same thing, but they give the logic of them having 'super powers.' But we don't need those special powers! The common man, the ticket-paying audience, including me, wants to watch my heroes larger-than-life. When I see Prabhas, Allu Arjun, and others going on screen and doing what they do, I clap and whistle"", theBrahmastraactor concluded.
Nagarjuna was speaking on the panel discussion 'Pan-Indian Cinema; Myth Or Momentum?,' where he was joined by actors Anupam Kher, Khusbhu, and Karthi.

But the ambition, according to key industry voices, must go beyond replicating old formulas. It requires identifying gaps, thinking hyper-locally, and scaling creatively for international relevance.
Speaking to NDTV's Editor-in-Chief, Sanjay Pugalia, on the second day of the World Audio Visual and Entertainment Summit (WAVES), Gaurav Gandhi, Vice President of Amazon Prime Video, reflected on the platform's eight-year journey in India.
He said, ""Our journey with Prime Video India has been over eight years. It's been amazing for us - full of learning and a lot of love from customers."" He added, ""When we started, we realised that to make an impact in India, you have to think local. As a market and as a country, we are so diverse that there's no single definition of 'local'. So, we had to think in multiple ways - local tastes, local languages, local milieu.""
This approach, he said, was rooted in identifying what the Indian ecosystem lacked. He shared, ""The first gap was the absence of high cinematic-value storytelling in India, which was already present internationally. The second gap was in movies - while we made a lot of them, there weren't enough theatres to screen them. The third was that everyone was locked into their own language. Keeping these three things in mind, we tried to bridge the gaps.""
Filmmaker Vikramaditya Motwane pointed out how the rise of streaming platforms has given creators the freedom they didn't have 10 to 15 years ago.
He stated, ""From where we were 10-15 years ago - when there was only one format and films were made only for the big screen - to now, the landscape has changed entirely,"" he said. ""Platforms like Prime Video and other streaming services have given creators the freedom to think beyond just a two-hour film in a theatre. Now you can make a crime series with multiple seasons and episodes. You can do a comedy series, something like Jubilee or Mumbai Diaries - there's so much freedom to tell stories.""
Motwane believes India is still in the early stages of this shift. He added, ""We're at a stage where filmmakers are discovering this freedom and just going for it. But I don't think we've reached the point where we've fully taken advantage of it yet. When that happens, the next step will be to create stories that not only work in India but also travel globally. That's when we'll truly enter the next generation of Indian storytelling,"" he said. ""Ten to fifteen years ago, people thought Indian content meant only Bollywood. That stereotype has broken, and over time, it will continue to break with different types of shows, films, and creators.""
Director Nikkhil Advani, who is currently busy with his upcoming revolutionaries, believes that historical storytelling must feel alive, not academic. ""Whenever you're working on something related to a historical period, the richer and more authentic the material, the better the starting point,"" he said. ""I did Rocket Boys, and now I'm working on Revolutionaries. It's always about the source material,"" he said.
Advani's approach is clear: entertain first, educate later. ""In the case of Revolutionaries, I'm having a lot of fun making it. The first thing I say is, 'Let's make revolutionaries sexy. Let's have fun with it.' Because if you give people a history lesson, their reaction is usually, 'nahi sunna hai, nahi dekhna hai' (don't want to listen, don't want to watch),"" he concluded.
According to the PMO, WAVES 2025 will host participants from over 90 countries, including more than 10,000 delegates, 1,000 creators, 300+ companies and 350+ startups.

Speaking to NDTV's Editor-in-Chief, Sanjay Pugalia, on the second day of the World Audio Visual and Entertainment Summit (WAVES), Aamir Khan highlighted the vast potential for collaboration between the two countries in cinema and creative content.
Aamir was on a panel named ""Indian Cinema, Oriental Look"" alongside Peter Ho Sun Chan, Stanley Tong and Prasad Shetty.
The spotlight was on Aamir, whose films - particularlyDangal(2016) - have seen phenomenal success in the Chinese market.
Offering insight into the emotional resonance between the two nations' audiences, Khan said, ""I've had the opportunity to visit China quite a few times over the last 6-10 years, and there's a lot I'd like to share. The audiences in China - their cultural sensibilities and emotional responses - are remarkably similar to those in India. From my experience, the way Chinese audiences reacted to my films, especiallyDangal, was almost identical to how Indian audiences responded. The emotions were universal.""
The actor went on to outline the creative and business opportunities such partnerships could bring. He shared, ""I truly believe there is immense potential here, for several reasons. First, India has a vibrant and dynamic creative community - and so does China. I've witnessed their events and films, and the quality of their work is truly world-class.""
He added, ""Whether from a creative, emotional, or business perspective, I think it's a win-win if we collaborate. Over the years, I've had many discussions with my friends from China about exploring these possibilities. Now, with initiatives like WAVES gaining momentum, this collaboration will likely get an even stronger push.""
""India and China are both ancient civilisations with rich histories and cultures. There's so much we can offer each other. I genuinely look forward to collaborating with creative talent from China,"" he concluded.
Aamir's statement comes at a time when India is aiming to position itself as a global content hub under the vision of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has repeatedly emphasised the importance of soft power in global diplomacy.
According to the PMO, WAVES 2025 will host participants from over 90 countries, including more than 10,000 delegates, 1,000 creators, 300+ companies and 350+ startups.

The makers of the K-drama recently unveiled a teaser that hints at a thrilling mix of adrenaline, emotion and second chances as Olympic athletes trade gold medals for police badges.
The 50-second teaser kicks off on a triumphant note, spotlighting each character's athletic glory.
Park Bo Gum is introduced as boxing champion Yoon Dong Joo, Kim So Hyun stuns as a sharpshooting prodigy, and Lee Sang Yi's fencing finesse is on full display. Joined by Heo Sung Tae and Tae Won Suk, the team is a force of sporting excellence.
But the teaser quickly pivots. Gone are the cheers and confetti - instead, viewers are plunged into a world of broken dreams and odd jobs.
From a restless Dong Joo sitting alone in a rundown car to a mascot-suited discus thrower trudging through monotony, the visuals reflect the weight of dashed hopes.
As these former athletes are roped into a rookie cop program, their camaraderie begins to grow - and so does the danger. A shadowy villain from Inseong City looms large, pushing them to revive their long-dormant skills.
Dubbed the ""Goodvengers,"" this unlikely squad rises to meet the chaos head-on, with Park Bo Gum's defiant closing line - ""The round isn't over until we've taken down our opponent"" - delivering the perfect punch.

https://www.ndtv.com/entertainment/why-shah-rukh-khans-first-crush-mumtaz-refused-to-play-his-mother-on-screen-8311787,Why Shah Rukh Khan's First Crush Mumtaz Refused To Play His Mother On Screen,"Fri, 02 May 2025 14:59:33 +0530","Mumtaz was one of the reigning Bollywood actresses of the 1960s and 1970s. Recently in a conversation with Vickey Lalwani, the actress revealed why she would not agree to play Shah Rukh Khan's mother on screen.
Mumtaz spoke about her rule that to play someone's mother on the big screen, the age gap has to be of 20 years.
She said, ""I'll only play a mom to an actor who is 20 years younger than me, and that, too, provided I look good on screen.""
She further revealed how she got married at a very young age, and that appearances matter a lot for her at this juncture, when she is picking and choosing scripts she would like to be a part of.
On being further probed about why Mumtaz would not be ready to be Shah Rukh Khan's mother onscreen when veteran actresses like Jaya Bachchan have already done it, she said, ""That's Jaya's decision.""
She further added, ""Tell Shah Rukh I'll work with him if I can look like I actually do. But he'll say no. Why should I have grey hair? He's very intelligent, very smart, and a lovely person. Just because he likes me doesn't mean he'd cast me if I don't look the part.""
Mumtaz expressed her admiration for Hollywood legend Jane Fonda and her performance inMother-in-Law.
She said, ""Her character didn't want to accept a girl who was 'gareeb' (poor). She had the freedom to look and dress the way she wanted. That's something I'd like too.""
For the unversed, years ago, Shah Rukh Khan confessed at a press meet that his first two crushes were Mumtaz and Saira Banu, calling them the most beautiful women in the world.
Some of Mumtaz's most popular films includeBandhan, Aadmi Aur Insaan, Sachaa Jhutha, Khilona, Tere Mere Sapne, Hare Rama Hare Krishna, Chor Machaye Shor, Aap Ki Kasam, Roti, and Prem Kahani.

From Raashii Khanna and Vaani Kapoor, Kareena Kapoor Khan and Amrita Rao, Sonakshi Sinha and Huma Qureshi, to name a few, strong female friendships have been the new trend in the film industry for a while now.
Mouni Roy who is currently busy with the promotions of her upcoming filmBhootnii, was asked about her friendship with Disha Patani. The two have been spotted several times at dinners and luxurious holidays. They also hype each other up on social media and keep sharing several pictures.
Reacting to the same, Mouni Roy toldNews18, ""Two heroines can definitely be friends. It has got nothing to do with the profession that you're in. You could be a doctor, an engineer or a builder and still find friends. I truly believe that your vibe catches your tribe.""
She added, ""You're operating on a certain energy level and if you find somebody matching that same energy, you'll bond. It has got nothing to do with the profession. There's nothing like women friendship. Sisterhood is very important to me. Having a group of women who're your thick friends is like your entire family. You can find a mother, a father, a brother, and a sister in them.""
Mouni will be seen with Palak Tiwari inBhootnii. Earlier Palak had heaped praises on Mouni and how wonderful she is to work with, and the joy of having a good bond with female co-stars.
Reacting to the same, Mouni said, ""If there's any unpleasantry, a negative vibe or you not getting along with your female co-actor, it gets very difficult to work and say the dialogues with that person. And in that process, the honesty of the craft gets lost. I'm glad we met each other through the making of this project. We genuinely like each other and each other's company. We gave one another the space when necessary but at the same time, we could come together, sit down and joke around.""
Bhootniiwas released in theatres on May 1, 2025.

Kareena started her journey way back in 2000 withRefugee, and continues to be a relevant name in the film industry. In the current lieu of actresses, Kareena is still holding her fort.
The actress expressed her love for Bollywood at the WAVES Summit 2025 event, she attended earlier today.
She said, ""Main toh yahin hoon. I'm very happy with my Indian movies. It's so much fun to dance to our Hindi songs and deliver Hindi dialogues.""
She then went on to talk about the impact of Hindi Cinema, abroad, as she spoke about how she had once crossed paths with a driver abroad who was singing Raj Kapoor's iconic songMera Joota Hai Japani.
Kareena shared some gorgeous pictures on Instagram, showing a glimpse of her look for the event.
She captioned it, ""So honoured to be part of a panel discussion at the WAVES Summit, where India isn't just part of the global entertainment conversation, we're driving it. India is fast emerging as a superpower in the global entertainment industry and this is the beginning of a creative movement that will define the future (sic).""
Yesterday Aamir Khan too emphasized on the lack of theatres in India at the WAVES Summit 2025.
He said, ""I have always believed that we have very few theatres for the size of the country and the number of people living in India. In India, we have around 10,000 screens, and in the US, which is one-third of our population, they have 40,000 screens and China has 90,000 screens. And even in this, 10,000, half are in the South and half in the rest of the country. So, for a Hindi film, you have a maximum of 5,000 screens. Our biggest hits over the years, no matter what language, have had a theatrical footfall of three crore people. That's only 2 per cent of our entire population.""
As for Kareena, her last film wasSingham Againwith Ajay Devgn in 2024.
NDTV is at the inaugural edition of the Waves Summit, currently on at the Jio World Centre in Mumbai. The event brings together the who's who of showbiz, creators, and everyone who's anyone in the world of entertainment in India and beyond. Catch all updates on NDTV.com, from May 1 to May 4.

Days after his revelation,Aashiquiactor Anu Aggarwal claimed she also drank urine and got health benefits.
In an interaction with Instant Bollywood, Anu Aggarwal said, ""Many people don't know this... whether it's ignorance or just a lack of awareness, but drinking urine, which is referred to as Aamroli, is actually a mudra (gesture/practice) in Yoga. I've practiced it myself. I have tried it, and it's a very important practice. But one crucial thing to remember is that you don't drink the entire urine. Only a specific part of it is consumed... That portion is considered amrit (elixir). It's known to help with anti-aging, keeping your skin wrinkle-free... it's truly amazing not just for health, but overall well-being. I've personally experienced its benefits.""
When asked about the lack of scientific evidence behind such claim, Anu said, ""Kitni purani hai? (How old is science) 200 years. Yog 10,000 saal se hai, toh kiski baat aap sunenge? (And Yog is 10,000 years old, so who would you listen). I definitely support this.""
A post shared by Instant Bollywood (@instantbollywood)
For the unversed, Paresh Rawal shared that Ajay Devgn's father Veeru Devgn suggested him to drink urine to heal his knee injury faster during an interaction with The Lallantop.
""Veeru Devgan had come to visit when I was in Nanavati (hospital). When he got to know I was there, he came up to me and asked what happened to me? I told him about my leg injury,"" Paresh Rawal said.
""He told me to drink my own urine first thing in the morning. All fighters do this. You will never face any problem, just drink urine first thing in the morning. He told me not to consume alcohol, which I had stopped, mutton or tobacco. He told me to eat regular food and urine in the morning,"" Paresh Rawal recalled.
Paresh Rawal was slammed by Dr Cyriac Abby Philips, who goes by ""The Liver Doc"" on social media. He wrote, ""Please don't drink your urine (or others) because a Bollywood actor says so. There is no scientific evidence to support the idea that drinking urine provides any health benefits"".

Did he expect the performances to have such a lasting impact?
“Yeah, for me, it is really one of the finest performances of Mr. Bachchan. I mean, he just gave everything to the film. And while we were shooting it, I could see it because he was enjoying it so much. Every reading, every scene, every moment, he was taking so much time and joy to do it. He will not leave the set, he will be just there,"" said the director.
Sirar further added, “And some days he will come and do the shots again. No, he just wanted to give his best because he was enjoying it so much. I saw in his eyes, in his behavior, how he was enjoying.”
Shoojit highlighted the cine icon's brilliance in capturing everyday nuances, bringing authenticity, and charm to his character through small, natural moments.
He added, “He would pick up those moments, those small moments with the house help. He was just having a blast there. Telling the neighbour, just being angry at a neighbour who comments. He was just enjoying all that. So, the small things, the way he sits down, the way he eats his food, the way he talks in the dining hall, that is the real joy that is brought in. Absolutely mesmerized by his performance.”
Pikurevolves around an architect named Piku and her ageing but nagging father Bhaskor Banerjee, who come close via a road trip to Kolkata despite their disparate ideologies and fights over trivial issues.
The comedy drama, which is set to clock 10 years since its release, stars Amitabh Bachchan, Deepika Padukone and Irrfan Khan along with Moushumi Chatterjee, Jisshu Sengupta, and Raghubir Yadav.
Piku, which is slated to re-release on May 9, 2025, emphasises on the emotional and moral responsibility of adult children to care for their aging parents, highlighting the challenges of balancing personal life with caregiving.
Asked how he feels the story ofPikuholds relevance today, especially considering the growing number of young adults balancing their personal lives with caring for aging parents, Shoojit toldIANS, “Yeah, caregiving is a very important issue now in our topic. So, parental caregiving is a crisis also at this moment in this modern family structure, which is going on in the society. So this film speaks volumes about that, where you still, you can't just abandon your elders and parents.”
He added, “Piku takes that charge also. Piku says, I mean, you know, 'I cannot just, I'll have to keep them alive. I mean, if they are not, if we don't take care, they won't be alive anymore. So to keep them alive, I will have to be there.' Also when parents grow old, there is a very clear message there in the film that when they get old, they can't live on their own.”
He added, “You will have to be with them so that they can pass through, you know. So that's very important and relevant also in today's time. So, I think Piku, as a very progressive girl from a progressive family, is quite clear about that, which I think is very important to take away fromPiku.”

The director recalled a special screening held in Hyderabad.
He said, ""Some people sent me videos from there. The audience was clapping at her entry scene. She was one of the few female lawyers in a room filled with men. And that in itself is the perfect response to all the negative comments.""
Karan Singh Tyagi added that Ananya Panday's performance in the 2022 romance dramaGehraiyaannudged him to cast her inKesari Chapter 2.
Kesari Chapter 2is bankrolled by Dharma Productions, Leo Media Collective, and Cape Of Good Films.

Speaking at WAVES 2025, Shekhar Kapursharedhis thoughts on how AI can create not just actors, but full-fledged stars.
Shekhar Kapoor said, ""Actors are going to be just actors,becauseAI will create stars going ahead. AI will create more human-like stars. And I can create a star using AI and have my copyright. And very soon there will be slew of ideas of AI movies that will have a girl or a boy or a man or a woman that I've created using AI, and that will be my copyright.""
Explaining why he doesn't feel the need for stars, Shekhar Kapur said, “In fact, now it's happening more and more. A lot of the influencers that you see are not humans. AI has created them. So why can't we have films with actors, characters who have become stars because we created them on AI?”
“I don't need Amitabh Bachchan. I'll create my own character. I don't need Shah Rukh Khan, I'll create my own character, my own star. And if I'm good enough, I'll create a character that the audience will love. And then I'll have my own star,"" he added.

He added, ""The second step, when films do that kind of business in your market, is that you have the capital to expand. So, we are attempting to makeMahavatar, which is probably the largest film we've ever made. We want to make it... there is the technology available to make a world-class film.""

On Day 9, the action thriller collected ₹7 lakh through ticket counters, according toSacnilk.
In total, the film has earned ₹7.45 crore in the domestic market over nine days. The project's worldwide collection stands at ₹8.03 crore, the report added.
Ground Zerocreated history by becoming the first film in 38 years to host a red-carpet premiere in Srinagar – a major milestone, especially since cinema halls in the city had shut down after the 1989 unrest.
Reflecting on the experience, Emraan Hashmi toldNDTV, “It was a huge cultural event. It was quite historic. After 38 years, who would have thought a certain air of normalcy would come back in Srinagar? It is a region that has been clouded by perception and goes from the past. When we went for our shoot in Srinagar, safety norms and the entire shooting went smoothly. We did not have any issues there.”
“We wanted to have an event for the jawans, for the officers, for some of the locals over there. There were just smiles on their faces of a certain normalcy, that has come back to the city, of having a red carpet event, having people from the Hindi film industry come there and showcase their film,” the actor added.
Ground Zero, directed by Tejas Prabha Vijay Deoskar, tells the courageous story of BSF officer Narendra Nath Dhar Dubey. The film follows his 2003 mission that led to the elimination of the notorious terrorist Rana Tahir Nadeem, widely known as Ghazi Baba.
Apart fromEmraan Hashmi,Ground Zeroalso features Sai Tamhankar, Zoya Hussain, Mukesh Tiwari, Deepak Parmesh, Lalit Prabhakar and Rockey Raina in pivotal roles.

However, following the terror attack in Pahalgam in April, the film faced backlash.
Government sources told PTI that the movie would not be allowed to release in India.
Soon after the attack, all posts related toAbir Gulaaldisappeared from Vaani Kapoor's Instagram account. This included posters, teasers, photos with Fawad Khan and behind-the-scenes content.
According to a report by Times Now, Vaani did not delete the posts herself. As per the report, the content was originally shared as Instagram collabs, and the deletion was done by the film's production team. As a result, the posts were automatically removed from her profile.
This followed restrictions placed on the Instagram accounts of several Pakistani artists, including Fawad Khan, Hania Aamir, Mahira Khan, and Atif Aslam. Their profiles are no longer accessible from India.
Users trying to view them see a message saying, ""Account not available in India. This is because we complied with a legal request to restrict this content.""
Abir Gulaal, a romantic drama directed by Aarti S. Bagdi and produced by Vivek Agrawal, was scheduled to release in India on 9 May. But after the Pahalgam attack and rising political tensions between India and Pakistan, the government said the film would not be allowed to be released.
The attack in Pahalgam on 22 April claimed 26 lives, mostly civilians. It has been described as the deadliest attack in the Valley since Pulwama in 2019. Several Bollywood actors, including Shah Rukh Khan, Salman Khan, Alia Bhatt and Priyanka Chopra, condemned the violence. Pakistani actors Hania Aamir and Mahira Khan also expressed condolences.
Meanwhile, Vaani Kapoor was last seen in Raid 2, where she played the role of Ajay Devgn's wife. The film also featured Saurabh Shukla, Riteish Deshmukh, Rajat Kapoor, and Supriya Pathak.

A post shared by Gigi Hadid (@gigihadid)
The couple were first seen together in October 2023, dining at Via Carota in New York City's West Village. Since then, their relationship has steadily grown.
In a recent interview with Vogue, Gigi described their bond as a ""very romantic and happy dynamic."" She noted that while dating in the public eye has its challenges, the relationship works because both are clear about what they want.
""To find someone that is in a place in their life where they know what they want and deserve and you both do work separately to come together and be the best partner that you can be. I just feel really lucky,"" she said. ""I respect him so much as a creative, and I feel that he gives so much to me: encouragement and, just, belief,"" she added.
A source told People earlier this year that while an engagement ""would be a big step,"" the couple is happy with where they are. They reportedly spend time with each other's families and children.
Bradley shares an 8-year-old daughter, Lea De Seine, with model Irina Shayk. Gigi, on the other hand, has a 4-year-old daughter, Khai, with singer Zayn Malik.

Following the backlash, the singer issued a statement on social media defending his stance. ""While I was singing my first song, there was a bunch of four-to-five students who were not demanding, but actually threateningly asking me to sing in Kannada. There were many people in the audience who tried to stop them and asked them to not cause disturbance,"" he said in a video shared on Instagram.
He added, ""Unn paanchon ko yeh yaad dilana aur batana bahut zaruri tha ki Pahalgam mein jab pant utaari gayi thi, tab bhaasha nahin poochi gayi thi. I love Kannadigas. They are extremely sweet and beautiful people, and I hold them very close to my heart. So, please do not generalise them.

25 Indian tourists and a Nepalese citizen were killed in the deadliest terror attack in Pahalgam, Jammu and Kashmir on April 22. The terror attack ignited a renewed demand to ban Pakistani artists working in India.

In retaliation, Pakistan suspended all trade with India, including through third countries. Pakistan rejected India's suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty and said any move to stop the flow of water will be seen as an ""act of war"".

Reflecting on the experience, Emraan Hashmi toldNDTV, “It was a huge cultural event. It was quite historic. After 38 years, who would have thought a certain air of normalcy would come back in Srinagar? It is a region that has been clouded by perception and goes from the past. When we went for our shoot in Srinagar, safety norms and the entire shooting went smoothly. We did not have any issues there.”
“We wanted to have an event for the jawans, for the officers, for some of the locals over there. There were just smiles on their faces of a certain normalcy, that has come back to the city, of having a red carpet event, having people from the Hindi film industry come there and showcase their film,” the actor added.
Ground Zero, directed by Tejas Prabha Vijay Deoskar, tells the courageous story of BSF officer Narendra Nath Dhar Dubey. The film follows his 2003 mission that led to the elimination of the notorious terrorist Rana Tahir Nadeem, widely known as Ghazi Baba.
Apart fromEmraan Hashmi,Ground Zeroalso features Sai Tamhankar, Zoya Hussain, Mukesh Tiwari, Deepak Parmesh, Lalit Prabhakar and Rockey Raina in pivotal roles.

In a recent interview with Vogue, Gigi described their bond as a ""very romantic and happy dynamic."" She noted that while dating in the public eye has its challenges, the relationship works because both are clear about what they want.
""To find someone that is in a place in their life where they know what they want and deserve and you both do work separately to come together and be the best partner that you can be. I just feel really lucky,"" she said. ""I respect him so much as a creative, and I feel that he gives so much to me: encouragement and, just, belief,"" she added.

Now, the 'Omkara' actor has cleared the air around his remark saying that he had apologized for being evil in the film, and not for the film itself.
Setting the record straight, she said, “I apologized to Tim for being the evil villain in the film. I was growling and smashing everyone in sight! He said next time you should play the hero. I stand by all my films, and this one too.”
Saif was in conversation with his 'Jewel Thief', co-star Jaideep Ahlawat during a segment on Netflix India's YouTube channel, where he shared that his son was not impressed by ""Adipurush"".
Looking back at the experience, Saif revealed, “My son and I were watching the film recently, and I understood that it was bad. My son gave me a look as if to ask why he was being made to watch it, and I understood the situation. I quickly apologised to him.”
Saif essayed the role of Lankesh, a character based on Ravana in the retelling of the epic tale of Ramayana.
The project which also saw Prabhas and Kriti Sanon as the lead turned out to be a box office debacle with director Om Raut's directorial facing criticism for poor VFX, and mediocre dialogues.
Recently, speaking with Ted Sarandos, Co-CEO of Netflix during WAVES Summit 2025, Saif opened up about the kind of content he likes to watch the most.
He revealed, “I like historical films. Maybe films about other cultures, maybe Japanese. I am also very excited to see our culture on the big screens. The Mahabharata is the greatest story ever told, it's one of our great epics. I also like to watch massive war scenes, bringing life, history, and a past that is related to books. I would like to see that kind of atmosphere in movies. And I feel the long-form streaming format is just perfect for it.”

However, they are yet to arrive at a mutual consensus when it comes to their daughter's education, reports ‘People' magazine.
The ‘Dawson's Creek' alum, 46, and the Queen & Slim actress, 38, have agreed to the terms of their split, according to legal documents obtained by ‘People' though the couple has yet to agree on where their daughter, 4-year-old Juno, will be going to school. TMZ was first to report the news.
The couple has agreed that they'll use a mediator to plan a schedule for the 50-50 custody of their daughter, that Joshua will pay $2,787 in child support and that there will be no monthly spousal support, rather a lump sum.
In addition to the terms the couple has agreed on, Turner-Smith also claims, in other court documents, that Jackson has pushed back on a court order regarding her making the decision tied to where their daughter will go to school. Representatives for both Turner-Smith and Jackson did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
As per ‘People', in the declaration, Turner-Smith said that she and her former husband ""participated in a full-day mediation"" with a judge in May 2024 and resolved their ""temporary custody issues"" for their daughter's 2024-25 school year.
Following the judge's term with them, both Turner-Smith and Jackson later entered ""into a Stipulation and Order to resolve the issue of selection of Juno's school”, with Turner-Smith writing that it authorized her ""to make the final decision"" regarding their daughter's education.
She wrote in the document, ""As such, I have the clear authority to make the school selection in Juno's best interest, and Josh is refusing to adhere to the terms of the Stipulation and Order and is depriving me of the right to select the school”.

In her autobiographySach Kahun Toh, Neena opened up about the decision and how it changed her life.
She recalled feeling ""giddy with joy"" when she first found out about her pregnancy, but also felt it was important to inform Vivian. At the time, he had already returned home. After a long phone call, Neena shared that Vivian supported her decision to have the baby, which gave her the confidence to go ahead.
Neena first met Vivian at a dinner party hosted by the Maharani of Jaipur, shortly after watching him play. They connected instantly but lost touch when he returned home, as they hadn't exchanged contact details. They met again at the Delhi airport and soon began a relationship.
When she found out she was pregnant, Neena received mixed advice from those around her. Some suggested ""abortion"", while others warned about the challenges of single motherhood. But after considering everything, she decided to continue with the pregnancy.
She said, ""Vivian and I had an affair, and I got pregnant. Some people advised me to get an abortion. Others cautioned against the perils of being a single parent. I listened to everyone patiently. They were all very concerned, I know. But once I was back home and alone, I asked myself: What do you think? How does this make you feel? The answer was: I was giddy with joy.""
She continued, ""I also understood that I wasn't the only person who had a say in the situation. The baby's father, Vivian, had an equal right. So, I called him one day and spoke to him for a long tome,"" she wrote and added, ""'I'm pregnant', I told him. 'Would you have a problem if I were to have your baby?' Vivian sounded happy and said I should go ahead. This assured me that I was doing the right thing. As much as I wanted this child, I also did not want to go ahead if the father wasn't on board. So, it came as a relief when Vivian supported my decision.""
She said Vivian was ""as involved as possible"" after Masaba's birth. Their relationship continued for a few years, going through different phases. At the time, Vivian was already married, and their long-distance relationship had its ups and downs.
""Our relationship continued on and off for a few years and we had some beautiful moments and also some ugly ones. It was long distance and a very different kind of relationship,"" she concluded.
Neena raised Masaba as a single mother. Years later, she got married at 59 to Vivek Mehra, a chartered accountant.

An FIR was registered on Saturday after the comments sparked controversy.
The singer wrote, ""I have given unprecedented love to the language, the culture, the music, the musicians, the state, and the people not just when I am in Karnataka but anywhere else in the world. In fact, I have revered my Kannada songs way more than my songs in other languages including Hindi. There are 100s of videos circulating on social media as a testimony. I have more than an hour of Kannada songs that I prepare for every concert when in Karnataka.""
A post shared by Sonu Nigam (@sonunigamofficial)
He added, ""Their own people were embarrassed and were asking them to shut up. I told them very politely and lovingly the show has just started, it's my first song, and that I will not let them down, but they have to let me continue with the concert the way I have planned. Every artist has a song list prepared so the musicians and technicians are in sync. But they were hell-bent on creating a ruckus and threatening me wildly. Tell me who is at fault?""
""I leave it up to the sensible people of Karnataka to decide who is at fault here. I will accept your verdict gracefully"", Sonu Nigam concluded.
The incident took place during a show held on April 25-26 at East Point College of Engineering and Technology in Virgonagar, Bengaluru. During the performance, a young man allegedly insisted that Sonu sing in Kannada, leading to a heated exchange.
The singer responded, ""I have sung in different languages, including Kannada. Whenever I come to Karnataka, I come with a lot of love and respect. You all have treated me like family,"" the singer said.
""I always sing Kannada songs when requested. I have been singing in Kannada before that young man was born. But I didn't like the way he shouted 'Kannada, Kannada'. It is because of such behaviour that incidents like the Pahalgam attack happen,"" Sonu Nigam added.
The remarks drew criticism from several quarters, including Kannada film producer Karthik Gowda and activist SR Govindu.

In a now-deleted Instagram post, Sai criticised Babil and said that the actor should apologise to everyone.
In a screenshot of the (now-deleted) post shared on Reddit, Sai Rajesh's statement read, ""To Babil Khan's team. Do you really think we're that naive to just walk away silently? What kind of attitude are we being subjected to? It feels like only those whose names were mentioned in his video deserve respect — and the rest of us are just fools for standing by him all this while?”
“If you're making them feel valued just because he gave them a shoutout, and ignoring the rest of us — then yes, we do deserve an apology for how things have been handled. I genuinely wanted to stand by him even until an hour ago. But if you're taking us for granted, that stops here. These sympathy games won't work on us anymore. A sincere apology is the least you owe us. Say it, and let's move on,” he added.
In the comments section of Sai Rajesh's post, Babil Khan wrote, “You really broke my heart. After everything I've given to you. @satish_naidu1982 2 years of my life, complete physical atrocity to my body just so I can do justice to his character, I gave him my soul, rejected everything that came in my way for 2 years, anything and everything he needed, for 500 days of my life.""
""Not to mention, the pain and the suffering I put in my soul, lived in filth just to make sure sir @sairazesh is happy with the character. It's okay now. I'll let my work speak. Goodbye. Man, I had bugs in my beard because he needed that in the character. I gave him my laughter while I held back my tears. I slit my f****** wrist for him,” theactoradded.
For context, Babil Khan was reportedly part of the Hindi remake ofBaby, the 2023 Telugu film directed by Sai Rajesh. Interestingly, the remake is also said to be directed by Sai himself.
For the unversed, Babil Khan posted a video on Instagram on Sunday. In the video, a visibly emotional Babil is seen calling Bollywood “rude” and naming peers like Ananya Panday, Siddhant Chaturvedi, Arjun Kapoor, Shanaya Kapoor and others.
Babil Khan quickly deleted the post and even took down his Instagram for a while. Later, Babil issued an apology, saying he was trying to support everyone he mentioned.
Babil Khan is now back on Instagram, and interestingly, many of the people he named in the video are now showing support for the young actor after the backlash he faced.

In a post Sunday night on his Truth Social platform, Trump said he has authorised the Department of Commerce and the Office of the US Trade Representative to slap a 100 per cent tariff ""on any and all Movies coming into our Country that are produced in Foreign Lands"".
Kapur, known for films such asMr India,theElizabethfranchise starring Cate Blanchett and ""What's Love Got to Do with It?, said over ""75% of box office"" of Hollywood films comes from outside the US.
""And significant part of the budget of those films are spent outside the US. President Trump's imposition of 100% tarif on all films imported into the US may encourage Hollywood to move outside the US! Quite the opposite of what he intended. #Hollywood #tarrif #DonaldTrump #tarrifonfilm (sic)"" the director wrote on X.
Filmmaker Anurag Kashyap simply shared Trump's comments on his Instagram Stories without comment.
""The Movie Industry in America is DYING a very fast death,"" Trump wrote, complaining that other countries ""are offering all sorts of incentives to draw"" filmmakers and studios away from the US.
""This is a concerted effort by other Nations and, therefore, a National Security threat. It is, in addition to everything else, messaging and propaganda!"" he added in his post.

https://www.ndtv.com/entertainment/what-is-the-house-arrest-controversy-and-why-ajaz-khan-is-in-the-dock-8334505,"FromHouse ArrestTo Calls For Arrest, Why Ajaz Khan Is Internet's Most Hated","Mon, 05 May 2025 14:47:12 +0530","Former Bigg Boss contestant Ajaz Khan has found himself at the centre of yet another storm - this time as the host of a reality show that many are calling one of the ""most disturbing ever"" streamed in India.
The show in question,House Arrest, airs on the Ullu app, an OTT platform frequently criticised for pushing the boundaries of adult content. What began as a typical ""lock-in drama"" turned controversial when a viral clip from the show showed contestants engaging in acts that many online have described as ""degrading, inappropriate, and even exploitative"".
Khan, who has previously courted controversy over issues ranging from communal comments to alleged drug possession, is now being slammed for allegedly encouraging vulgar behaviour on screen. Here's a breakdown of what exactly happened and why it matters.
House Arrestis a reality show streaming on the Ullu app, known for its bold and provocative content. In a format reminiscent of Bigg Boss, contestants are locked inside a luxurious villa and subjected to various emotionally and physically demanding tasks.
The show promises intense drama, unexpected romances and explosive confrontations. Some of the participants include Aabha Paul, Humera Shaikh, Sarika Salunkhe, Muskaan Agarwal and Rahul Bhoj.
The controversy began when a viral clip fromHouse Arrestsurfaced online, triggering massive public outrage. In the video, a female contestant expressed that she lacked knowledge about sexual matters.
Instead of handling the moment with sensitivity, host Ajaz Khan allegedly encouraged other participants to demonstrate sexual positions on camera. The contestant appeared visibly uncomfortable, while other cast members reportedly clapped and booed as some of the women removed their undergarments. The episode has since been widely condemned for its exploitative and degrading tone.
Ajaz Khan, a former Bigg Boss contestant, hostsHouse Arrestand has called himself the ""daddy of the house."" Many argue that instead of maintaining boundaries and respecting participant consent, Khan turned the show into a space of spectacle and humiliation.
His role in directing the questionable scene and encouraging others to act it out has brought him under intense scrutiny, with many accusing him of legitimising vulgarity under the guise of entertainment. This incident has only added to the long list of controversies surrounding him.
Streaming platforms like Ullu and ALTBalaji have repeatedly been flagged for pushing the boundaries of acceptable content. While 18 other OTT platforms were banned by the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting in 2023 for explicit and pornographic content, Ullu and ALTBalaji were notably excluded.
ALT Balaji - founded by television producer Ekta Kapoor - has repeatedly faced backlash over its shows. From the erotic dramaXXXto controversial series likeGandii Baat, the platform has been accused of misrepresenting minors, glorifying incest and pushing soft porn under the guise of bold storytelling.
Legal complaints, especially involving season 6 ofGandii Baat, have led to serious charges under the IPC, IT Act and POCSO Act. Internet users have long pointed out that ALT Balaji's attempts to defend such content as 'women-centric' or 'progressive' often fall flat in the face of recurring themes that many deem exploitative and culturally insensitive.
Shiv Sena MP Priyanka Chaturvedi has questioned this selective censorship, stating that she has raised concerns in parliamentary committees with no clear response from authorities. BJP MP Nishikant Dubey has also assured that action will be taken.
The public response to theHouse Arrestclip was swift and fierce. Viewers labelled the episode as ""disturbing,"" ""degrading,"" and ""unwatchable.""
Many questioned how such shows get approved and are allowed to stream unchecked. One user on X (formerly Twitter) asked, ""How do they approve such TV Shows?"" while another pointed out the blurring line between entertainment and exploitation.
The outrage has amplified calls for stricter pre-release regulation of OTT content and increased accountability for streaming platforms.
India currently regulates OTT content through the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021. The framework includes a three-tier grievance redressal system and expects platforms to self-regulate.
However, the government is now working on new rules that will allow for content regulation before release. Under existing laws, platforms must categorise content by age suitability, ensure age-gating for mature material and comply with laws on obscenity and child protection, including the POCSO Act, the Indecent Representation of Women (Prohibition) Act and the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS), 2023.
Several other OTT series have also faced backlash for similar reasons. ALTBalaji'sGandii Baatlanded in legal trouble when it was accused of featuring obscene scenes involving minors. A case was filed under the POCSO Act and the IT Act.
Another ALTBalaji series,XXX Season 2, faced criticism for a storyline involving a woman's affair while her army husband was on duty, prompting outrage from military families.
Similarly, Netflix'sRana Naidushocked fans of actor Venkatesh with its explicit dialogues and was compared unfavourably toSacred GamesandMirzapur.
Ajaz Khan has been embroiled in multiple controversies over the years:

The industry, which has been going through a lull phase with big-ticket films falling flat at the box office one after another, has never prioritised originality, accused Nawazuddin Siddiqui. In a recent conversation with Puja Talwar on herYouTube channel,Nawazuddin called out the culture of sequels as ""pathetic"".
Talking about the trend of formulaic films, Nawazuddin Siddiqui said, ""In our industry, the same thing is repeated for five years straight - then, when people get bored, they finally let it go. Actually insecuritybohut badh gayi hai.Unko lagta hai ek formula chal raha hai toh usse chala lo, ghiso isko.Aur usse bhi pathetic yeh hogaya kiyeh 2, 3, 4 (sequels) hone lag gaya. (Actually, insecurity has increased a lot. They feel that if a formula is working, they should keep milking it, overdo it. And what's even more pathetic is that now there are 2, 3, 4 sequels being made).""
Nawazuddin Siddiqui coined the term ""creativeruptcy"" to point out the creative emptiness of the industry. ""Kahin na kahin jaise bankruptcy hoti hai, vaise yeh creativeruptcy hogaya. Kangaliyat hai bohut zayada. Shuru se humari industry chor rahi hai. Humne gaane chori kiye, story chori ki(It's creative bankruptcy, just like financial bankruptcy. There's a lot of creative poverty. From the beginning, our industry has been stealing. We've stolen songs, we've stolen stories),"" he said.
Nawazuddin Siddiqui went on and added the tradition of ""copying"" has been in vogue for decades.
""Ab jo chor hote hain, voh kahan se creative ho sakte hain. Humne south se churaya, kabhi yahan se churaya, kabhi wahan se churaya. Even some cult-films which became hits, unke scenes bhi chori kare hue hain. Isko itna normalise kardiya gaya ki chori hai toh kya hua?(Now, how can thieves be creative? We've stolen from the South, sometimes from here, sometimes from there. Even some cult films that became hits have scenes that were copied. This has been so normalised that it's like - so what if it's stolen?).
""Earlier, they used to hand over a video and say, 'This is the film we want to make.' They'd watch that and just replicate it here,"" he added.
Nawazuddin Siddiqui pointed out that filmmakers, who wanted to make out-of-the-box films, were forced to quit.
""What can you expect from an industry like this? What kind of actors will come in? They'll be of the same kind. And then actors and directors start quitting - like Anurag Kashyap, who was bringing in good work,"" said the actor.
Earlier, Anurag Kashyap also vent out his frustration that the industry lacks ""creative stimulation"", which drives him to relocate to the South.

The film, featuring Vaani Kapoor, was supposed to release in India on May 9. Prakash Raj, who is always vocal about his ideas, now, has commented on the ban on the film in an interview withThe Lallantop.
""I'm not for any banning of films, whether it's right-wing or a propaganda film. Let people decide. People have the right. You can't ban films, unless it's pornography or about child abuse. But thought process? So what? Let them come, no,"" Prakash Raj added.
He went on to add, ""Today, anybody can get hurt. 'I'll cut the nose of Deepika Padukone! I'll behead her!' Useey kya hoga (what effect would that have)?. Shah Rukh Khan... just because of a colour? Besharam rang na... they can make a hue and cry about anything they want and the present power are letting that happen, to create a fear in the society.""
Prakash Raj referred to the controversies related to Sanjay Leela Bhansali'sPadmaavatand Shah Rukh Khan'sPathaan. Ahead of the release ofPadmaavat, an extremist outfit had called a ban on the film and threats were made to Deepika Padukone.
The second instance he referred to was the use of an orange bikini in the songBesharam Rangin Shah Rukh Khan'sPathaan.
After the Pahalgam attack, the Federation of Western India Cine Employees, an organisation of movie artists, pushed for the movie's boycott. The organisation had called for boycotting Pakistani artists, singers and technicians in the Indian film industry after the 2019 Pulwama terror attack, which claimed the lives of 35 paramilitary personnel.
Following the Pahalgam attack, this organisation renewed its directive. ""Despite the ongoing directive, we've been made aware of the recent collaboration with Pakistani actor Fawad Khan for the Hindi film, 'Abir Gulaal'. In light of the recent attack in Pahalgam, FWICE is once again compelled to issue a blanket boycott on all Pakistani artists, singers and technicians participating in any Indian film or entertainment projects. This includes performances or collaborations occurring anywhere in the world,"" the organisation said in a statement.
According to sources in the Information and Broadcasting ministry, several cinema halls were not ready to screen the film and several entertainment organisations had demanded its boycott. In the wake of the demands, the ministry had decided to put a stay on the film's release.

However, they are yet to arrive at a mutual consensus when it comes to their daughter's education, reports ‘People' magazine.
The ‘Dawson's Creek' alum, 46, and the Queen & Slim actress, 38, have agreed to the terms of their split, according to legal documents obtained by ‘People' though the couple has yet to agree on where their daughter, 4-year-old Juno, will be going to school. TMZ was first to report the news.
The couple has agreed that they'll use a mediator to plan a schedule for the 50-50 custody of their daughter, that Joshua will pay $2,787 in child support and that there will be no monthly spousal support, rather a lump sum.
In addition to the terms the couple has agreed on, Turner-Smith also claims, in other court documents, that Jackson has pushed back on a court order regarding her making the decision tied to where their daughter will go to school. Representatives for both Turner-Smith and Jackson did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
As per ‘People', in the declaration, Turner-Smith said that she and her former husband ""participated in a full-day mediation"" with a judge in May 2024 and resolved their ""temporary custody issues"" for their daughter's 2024-25 school year.
Following the judge's term with them, both Turner-Smith and Jackson later entered ""into a Stipulation and Order to resolve the issue of selection of Juno's school”, with Turner-Smith writing that it authorized her ""to make the final decision"" regarding their daughter's education.
She wrote in the document, ""As such, I have the clear authority to make the school selection in Juno's best interest, and Josh is refusing to adhere to the terms of the Stipulation and Order and is depriving me of the right to select the school”.

In her autobiographySach Kahun Toh, Neena opened up about the decision and how it changed her life.
She recalled feeling ""giddy with joy"" when she first found out about her pregnancy, but also felt it was important to inform Vivian. At the time, he had already returned home. After a long phone call, Neena shared that Vivian supported her decision to have the baby, which gave her the confidence to go ahead.
Neena first met Vivian at a dinner party hosted by the Maharani of Jaipur, shortly after watching him play. They connected instantly but lost touch when he returned home, as they hadn't exchanged contact details. They met again at the Delhi airport and soon began a relationship.
When she found out she was pregnant, Neena received mixed advice from those around her. Some suggested ""abortion"", while others warned about the challenges of single motherhood. But after considering everything, she decided to continue with the pregnancy.
She said, ""Vivian and I had an affair, and I got pregnant. Some people advised me to get an abortion. Others cautioned against the perils of being a single parent. I listened to everyone patiently. They were all very concerned, I know. But once I was back home and alone, I asked myself: What do you think? How does this make you feel? The answer was: I was giddy with joy.""
She continued, ""I also understood that I wasn't the only person who had a say in the situation. The baby's father, Vivian, had an equal right. So, I called him one day and spoke to him for a long tome,"" she wrote and added, ""'I'm pregnant', I told him. 'Would you have a problem if I were to have your baby?' Vivian sounded happy and said I should go ahead. This assured me that I was doing the right thing. As much as I wanted this child, I also did not want to go ahead if the father wasn't on board. So, it came as a relief when Vivian supported my decision.""
She said Vivian was ""as involved as possible"" after Masaba's birth. Their relationship continued for a few years, going through different phases. At the time, Vivian was already married, and their long-distance relationship had its ups and downs.
""Our relationship continued on and off for a few years and we had some beautiful moments and also some ugly ones. It was long distance and a very different kind of relationship,"" she concluded.
Neena raised Masaba as a single mother. Years later, she got married at 59 to Vivek Mehra, a chartered accountant.

An FIR was registered on Saturday after the comments sparked controversy.
The singer wrote, ""I have given unprecedented love to the language, the culture, the music, the musicians, the state, and the people not just when I am in Karnataka but anywhere else in the world. In fact, I have revered my Kannada songs way more than my songs in other languages including Hindi. There are 100s of videos circulating on social media as a testimony. I have more than an hour of Kannada songs that I prepare for every concert when in Karnataka.""
A post shared by Sonu Nigam (@sonunigamofficial)
He added, ""Their own people were embarrassed and were asking them to shut up. I told them very politely and lovingly the show has just started, it's my first song, and that I will not let them down, but they have to let me continue with the concert the way I have planned. Every artist has a song list prepared so the musicians and technicians are in sync. But they were hell-bent on creating a ruckus and threatening me wildly. Tell me who is at fault?""
""I leave it up to the sensible people of Karnataka to decide who is at fault here. I will accept your verdict gracefully"", Sonu Nigam concluded.
The incident took place during a show held on April 25-26 at East Point College of Engineering and Technology in Virgonagar, Bengaluru. During the performance, a young man allegedly insisted that Sonu sing in Kannada, leading to a heated exchange.
The singer responded, ""I have sung in different languages, including Kannada. Whenever I come to Karnataka, I come with a lot of love and respect. You all have treated me like family,"" the singer said.
""I always sing Kannada songs when requested. I have been singing in Kannada before that young man was born. But I didn't like the way he shouted 'Kannada, Kannada'. It is because of such behaviour that incidents like the Pahalgam attack happen,"" Sonu Nigam added.
The remarks drew criticism from several quarters, including Kannada film producer Karthik Gowda and activist SR Govindu.

The speculation gained momentum after Sobhita appeared at WAVES 2025 in Mumbai, wearing a saree that some believed was styled to conceal a baby bump. Her recent choice of loose-fitting outfits further fuelled the buzz.
However, a source close to the development has dismissed the rumours. Speaking to ETimes, the source said, ""She wore anti-fit, not maternity. It's amazing how a change in silhouette can birth a whole new storyline.""
The couple, who have kept their relationship largely private, first connected after an Instagram interaction led to conversations and a shared love for the Telugu language. They got engaged in Hyderabad on August 8, 2024, and married on December 4 at Annapurna Studios in the presence of close friends and family.
Their wedding came three years after Naga Chaitanya's separation from Samantha Ruth Prabhu, announced in October 2021.

It all started after Babil shared a video of himself and called Bollywood “rude.” The clip spread like a wildfire, generating mixed reactions.
Now,Babil Khanhas reacted to directorSai Rajesh's comment on the video.
In a now-deleted Instagram post, Sai criticised Babil and said that the actor should apologise to everyone.
In a screenshot of the (now-deleted) post shared on Reddit, Sai Rajesh's statement read, ""To Babil Khan's team. Do you really think we're that naive to just walk away silently? What kind of attitude are we being subjected to? It feels like only those whose names were mentioned in his video deserve respect — and the rest of us are just fools for standing by him all this while?”
“If you're making them feel valued just because he gave them a shoutout, and ignoring the rest of us — then yes, we do deserve an apology for how things have been handled. I genuinely wanted to stand by him even until an hour ago. But if you're taking us for granted, that stops here. These sympathy games won't work on us anymore. A sincere apology is the least you owe us. Say it, and let's move on,” he added.
In the comments section of Sai Rajesh's post, Babil Khan wrote, “You really broke my heart. After everything I've given to you. @satish_naidu1982 2 years of my life, complete physical atrocity to my body just so I can do justice to his character, I gave him my soul, rejected everything that came in my way for 2 years, anything and everything he needed, for 500 days of my life.""
""Not to mention, the pain and the suffering I put in my soul, lived in filth just to make sure sir @sairazesh is happy with the character. It's okay now. I'll let my work speak. Goodbye. Man, I had bugs in my beard because he needed that in the character. I gave him my laughter while I held back my tears. I slit my f****** wrist for him,” theactoradded.
For context, Babil Khan was reportedly part of the Hindi remake ofBaby, the 2023 Telugu film directed by Sai Rajesh. Interestingly, the remake is also said to be directed by Sai himself.
For the unversed, Babil Khan posted a video on Instagram on Sunday. In the video, a visibly emotional Babil is seen calling Bollywood “rude” and naming peers like Ananya Panday, Siddhant Chaturvedi, Arjun Kapoor, Shanaya Kapoor and others.
Babil Khan quickly deleted the post and even took down his Instagram for a while. Later, Babil issued an apology, saying he was trying to support everyone he mentioned.
Babil Khan is now back on Instagram, and interestingly, many of the people he named in the video are now showing support for the young actor after the backlash he faced.

In a post Sunday night on his Truth Social platform, Trump said he has authorised the Department of Commerce and the Office of the US Trade Representative to slap a 100 per cent tariff ""on any and all Movies coming into our Country that are produced in Foreign Lands"".
Kapur, known for films such asMr India,theElizabethfranchise starring Cate Blanchett and ""What's Love Got to Do with It?, said over ""75% of box office"" of Hollywood films comes from outside the US.
""And significant part of the budget of those films are spent outside the US.

""The Movie Industry in America is DYING a very fast death,"" Trump wrote, complaining that other countries ""are offering all sorts of incentives to draw"" filmmakers and studios away from the US.
""This is a concerted effort by other Nations and, therefore, a National Security threat. It is, in addition to everything else, messaging and propaganda!"" he added in his post.

https://www.ndtv.com/entertainment/what-is-the-house-arrest-controversy-and-why-ajaz-khan-is-in-the-dock-8334505,"FromHouse ArrestTo Calls For Arrest, Why Ajaz Khan Is Internet's Most Hated","Mon, 05 May 2025 14:47:12 +0530","Former Bigg Boss contestant Ajaz Khan has found himself at the centre of yet another storm - this time as the host of a reality show that many are calling one of the ""most disturbing ever"" streamed in India.
The show in question,House Arrest, airs on the Ullu app, an OTT platform frequently criticised for pushing the boundaries of adult content. What began as a typical ""lock-in drama"" turned controversial when a viral clip from the show showed contestants engaging in acts that many online have described as ""degrading, inappropriate, and even exploitative"".
Khan, who has previously courted controversy over issues ranging from communal comments to alleged drug possession, is now being slammed for allegedly encouraging vulgar behaviour on screen. Here's a breakdown of what exactly happened and why it matters.
House Arrestis a reality show streaming on the Ullu app, known for its bold and provocative content. In a format reminiscent of Bigg Boss, contestants are locked inside a luxurious villa and subjected to various emotionally and physically demanding tasks.
The show promises intense drama, unexpected romances and explosive confrontations. Some of the participants include Aabha Paul, Humera Shaikh, Sarika Salunkhe, Muskaan Agarwal and Rahul Bhoj.
The controversy began when a viral clip fromHouse Arrestsurfaced online, triggering massive public outrage. In the video, a female contestant expressed that she lacked knowledge about sexual matters.
Instead of handling the moment with sensitivity, host Ajaz Khan allegedly encouraged other participants to demonstrate sexual positions on camera. The contestant appeared visibly uncomfortable, while other cast members reportedly clapped and booed as some of the women removed their undergarments. The episode has since been widely condemned for its exploitative and degrading tone.
Ajaz Khan, a former Bigg Boss contestant, hostsHouse Arrestand has called himself the ""daddy of the house."" Many argue that instead of maintaining boundaries and respecting participant consent, Khan turned the show into a space of spectacle and humiliation.
His role in directing the questionable scene and encouraging others to act it out has brought him under intense scrutiny, with many accusing him of legitimising vulgarity under the guise of entertainment. This incident has only added to the long list of controversies surrounding him.
Streaming platforms like Ullu and ALTBalaji have repeatedly been flagged for pushing the boundaries of acceptable content. While 18 other OTT platforms were banned by the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting in 2023 for explicit and pornographic content, Ullu and ALTBalaji were notably excluded.
ALT Balaji - founded by television producer Ekta Kapoor - has repeatedly faced backlash over its shows. From the erotic dramaXXXto controversial series likeGandii Baat, the platform has been accused of misrepresenting minors, glorifying incest and pushing soft porn under the guise of bold storytelling.
Legal complaints, especially involving season 6 ofGandii Baat, have led to serious charges under the IPC, IT Act and POCSO Act. Internet users have long pointed out that ALT Balaji's attempts to defend such content as 'women-centric' or 'progressive' often fall flat in the face of recurring themes that many deem exploitative and culturally insensitive.
Shiv Sena MP Priyanka Chaturvedi has questioned this selective censorship, stating that she has raised concerns in parliamentary committees with no clear response from authorities. BJP MP Nishikant Dubey has also assured that action will be taken.
The public response to theHouse Arrestclip was swift and fierce. Viewers labelled the episode as ""disturbing,"" ""degrading,"" and ""unwatchable.""
Many questioned how such shows get approved and are allowed to stream unchecked. One user on X (formerly Twitter) asked, ""How do they approve such TV Shows?"" while another pointed out the blurring line between entertainment and exploitation.
The outrage has amplified calls for stricter pre-release regulation of OTT content and increased accountability for streaming platforms.
India currently regulates OTT content through the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021. The framework includes a three-tier grievance redressal system and expects platforms to self-regulate.
However, the government is now working on new rules that will allow for content regulation before release. Under existing laws, platforms must categorise content by age suitability, ensure age-gating for mature material and comply with laws on obscenity and child protection, including the POCSO Act, the Indecent Representation of Women (Prohibition) Act and the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS), 2023.
Several other OTT series have also faced backlash for similar reasons. ALTBalaji'sGandii Baatlanded in legal trouble when it was accused of featuring obscene scenes involving minors. A case was filed under the POCSO Act and the IT Act.
Another ALTBalaji series,XXX Season 2, faced criticism for a storyline involving a woman's affair while her army husband was on duty, prompting outrage from military families.
Similarly, Netflix'sRana Naidushocked fans of actor Venkatesh with its explicit dialogues and was compared unfavourably toSacred GamesandMirzapur.
Ajaz Khan has been embroiled in multiple controversies over the years:

The industry, which has been going through a lull phase with big-ticket films falling flat at the box office one after another, has never prioritised originality, accused Nawazuddin Siddiqui. In a recent conversation with Puja Talwar on herYouTube channel,Nawazuddin called out the culture of sequels as ""pathetic"".
Talking about the trend of formulaic films, Nawazuddin Siddiqui said, ""In our industry, the same thing is repeated for five years straight - then, when people get bored, they finally let it go. Actually insecuritybohut badh gayi hai.Unko lagta hai ek formula chal raha hai toh usse chala lo, ghiso isko.Aur usse bhi pathetic yeh hogaya kiyeh 2, 3, 4 (sequels) hone lag gaya. (Actually, insecurity has increased a lot. They feel that if a formula is working, they should keep milking it, overdo it. And what's even more pathetic is that now there are 2, 3, 4 sequels being made).""
Nawazuddin Siddiqui coined the term ""creativeruptcy"" to point out the creative emptiness of the industry. ""Kahin na kahin jaise bankruptcy hoti hai, vaise yeh creativeruptcy hogaya. Kangaliyat hai bohut zayada. Shuru se humari industry chor rahi hai. Humne gaane chori kiye, story chori ki(It's creative bankruptcy, just like financial bankruptcy. There's a lot of creative poverty. From the beginning, our industry has been stealing. We've stolen songs, we've stolen stories),"" he said.
Nawazuddin Siddiqui went on and added the tradition of ""copying"" has been in vogue for decades.
""Ab jo chor hote hain, voh kahan se creative ho sakte hain. Humne south se churaya, kabhi yahan se churaya, kabhi wahan se churaya. Even some cult-films which became hits, unke scenes bhi chori kare hue hain. Isko itna normalise kardiya gaya ki chori hai toh kya hua?(Now, how can thieves be creative? We've stolen from the South, sometimes from here, sometimes from there. Even some cult films that became hits have scenes that were copied. This has been so normalised that it's like - so what if it's stolen?).
""Earlier, they used to hand over a video and say, 'This is the film we want to make.' They'd watch that and just replicate it here,"" he added.
Nawazuddin Siddiqui pointed out that filmmakers, who wanted to make out-of-the-box films, were forced to quit.
""What can you expect from an industry like this? What kind of actors will come in? They'll be of the same kind. And then actors and directors start quitting - like Anurag Kashyap, who was bringing in good work,"" said the actor.
Earlier, Anurag Kashyap also vent out his frustration that the industry lacks ""creative stimulation"", which drives him to relocate to the South.

The film, featuring Vaani Kapoor, was supposed to release in India on May 9. Prakash Raj, who is always vocal about his ideas, now, has commented on the ban on the film in an interview withThe Lallantop.
""I'm not for any banning of films, whether it's right-wing or a propaganda film. Let people decide. People have the right. You can't ban films, unless it's pornography or about child abuse. But thought process? So what? Let them come, no,"" Prakash Raj added.
He went on to add, ""Today, anybody can get hurt. 'I'll cut the nose of Deepika Padukone! I'll behead her!' Useey kya hoga (what effect would that have)?. Shah Rukh Khan... just because of a colour? Besharam rang na... they can make a hue and cry about anything they want and the present power are letting that happen, to create a fear in the society.""
Prakash Raj referred to the controversies related to Sanjay Leela Bhansali'sPadmaavatand Shah Rukh Khan'sPathaan. Ahead of the release ofPadmaavat, an extremist outfit had called a ban on the film and threats were made to Deepika Padukone.
The second instance he referred to was the use of an orange bikini in the songBesharam Rangin Shah Rukh Khan'sPathaan.
After the Pahalgam attack, the Federation of Western India Cine Employees, an organisation of movie artists, pushed for the movie's boycott. The organisation had called for boycotting Pakistani artists, singers and technicians in the Indian film industry after the 2019 Pulwama terror attack, which claimed the lives of 35 paramilitary personnel.
Following the Pahalgam attack, this organisation renewed its directive. ""Despite the ongoing directive, we've been made aware of the recent collaboration with Pakistani actor Fawad Khan for the Hindi film, 'Abir Gulaal'. In light of the recent attack in Pahalgam, FWICE is once again compelled to issue a blanket boycott on all Pakistani artists, singers and technicians participating in any Indian film or entertainment projects. This includes performances or collaborations occurring anywhere in the world,"" the organisation said in a statement.
According to sources in the Information and Broadcasting ministry, several cinema halls were not ready to screen the film and several entertainment organisations had demanded its boycott. In the wake of the demands, the ministry had decided to put a stay on the film's release.

An elated Ishita took to her social media account to share a beautiful anniversary wish for her husband, Vatsal.
The actress also shared a picture from her wedding ceremony and another picture from her recent vacation with Vatsal and her family.
Ishita wrote, ""Happy Anniversary, Vatty. Eight years, two beautiful babies… and a lifetime of love to go. Us, always and forever.”
For the uninitiated, Vatsal and Ishita met on the sets of the TV show 'Rishton Ka Sadaagar Baazigar' in 2016 and dated for about a year before getting married.
The couple tied the knot in November 2017, and they welcomed their first child, a son, in 2023 and their daughter in 2025.
A post shared by Ishita Dutta Sheth (@ishidutta)
Interestingly, Vatsal played Ajay Devgn's son in the movie 'Tarzan: The Wonder Car', which was released in 2004, while Ishita portrayed Ajay's daughter in 'Drishyam' in 2015.
Bollywood stars Kajol and Ajay were among the first guests to attend Ishita and Vatsal's wedding that took place in Mumbai.
Talking about Ishita, the actress recently marked her return to the silver screen with the sequel, 'De De Pyaar De 2'.
The movie marked her first release after becoming a mother of two kids -- son Vaayu and daughter Veda.
Ishita further revealed that she shot the romantic comedy while being pregnant with her daughter.
Earlier, she had taken to her social media account and shared a photo of herself posing next to a billboard of 'De De Pyaar De 2', which most likely looked like a cinema hall.
She wrote, ""Super excited for this one... My first film post both my kids; I was pregnant with Veda while filming this one. Being back after 4 years feels so strange, almost like a new beginning... Need all your blessings... Can I say I have forgotten how to pose? I have forgotten how to be me... To a new beginning (sic).""

From interesting travel tales to fond movie memories and thoughtful insights, the veteran actress is an open book when it comes to her social media posts.
Last year, she shared the story of how the late actor-filmmaker Raj Kapoor cast her as Rupa in the hit 1978 musical romanceSatyam Shivam Sundaram. Zeenat Aman describedSatyam Shivam Sundaramas ""a defining anecdote"" from her career. She wrote, “In December, we will mark the 100th birth anniversary of the extraordinary Raj Kapoor. I have rehashed the story of how he came to cast me as Rupa in Satyam Shivam Sundaram countless times, but here it is for Instagram. A defining anecdote from my career.”
A post shared by Zeenat Aman (@thezeenataman)
Zeenat Aman retraced her steps back to the 1982Raj Kapoor-led dramaVakil Babu. She said, “It was 1981, and we were shootingVakil Babu. Rajji (Raj Kapoor) was playing the titular role, while his younger brother Shashi Kapoor and I were playing leading roles as each other's love interests. In between takes, while the technicians changed sets and rigged lights, we cast members often found ourselves with time to kill. Now Rajji had a radical approach to his art, and he was brimming with enthusiasm for a film he wanted to make. For days he regaled us with his idea for a story about a man who falls in love with a woman's voice but can't quite reconcile himself to her appearance.”
Zeenat Aman added that Raj Kapoor “never once hinted” that she could be a part of the project. “He spoke with unfettered and rousing passion, but never once even hinted that I could be a part of this film. I was already a star in my own right, and his lack of interest in casting me began to chafe. I knew that my ‘modern image', complete with mini skirts and boots, was the culprit. So I determined to take matters into my own hands,” she said.
Revealing how she presented herself as Rupa in front of Raj Kapoor, Zeenat Aman continued, “I knew that Rajji spent much of his spare time at ‘The Cottage' set on the grounds of his sprawling R.K. Studio. It was here that he would hold meetings or host small events, often presiding over these gathering from a pristine mattress placed on the floor. So I made my move. One evening, having wrapped up early from the shoot, I spent an extra 30 minutes in my dressing room making myself up in my own interpretation of Rupa. I put on a ghagra choli, braided my hair with a parandi, and then stuck tissue paper onto my face with glue in an effort to scar my visage.”
“When I reached The Cottage I was greeted at the door by John, Rajji's right-hand man. He looked quizzically at me but followed my request - ‘Saabji ko kaho ki Rupa ayi hai',” signed off Zeenat Aman, before adding that she would be continuing the story the next day.

Zeenat Aman has appeared in movies likeDon, Hare Rama Hare Krishna, Yaadon Ki BaraatandDostana, Qurbani. She will next be seen in Faraz Arif Ansari'sBun Tikki.

A contestant onKBC 16asked Amitabh Bachchan whether the Bollywood legend ever looks at the price tag before making a purchase. Big B responded by saying that it is natural for any person to check the price before buying anything. Then, he went on to narrate an incident that took place in London.
Amitabh Bachchansaid, “We were just shopping around, and I happened to be looking at a tie, when the shopkeeper, with a dismissive tone, said it cost 120 pounds.”
The actor added, ""I looked right back at him and responded, ‘Pack ten of these for me.' It's moments like these that remind me of the importance of showing our Indian spirit and confidence, even when faced with condescension. We sometimes need to make it clear that we are not to be underestimated.”
In another promo shared by KBC makers,Amitabh Bachchan was seen talking about his college days.When a contestant asked if he visited girls' colleges such as Lady Shri Ram College (LSR), Gargi or Kamala Nehru College during his student life, the actor seemed to be avoiding the question.
He said, ""Dekhiye devi ji ki kya hai ki ab hum shadi-shuda ho gaye hai, aur nati-pota bhi ho gaye hai. Ab woh zamana jo tha wo jawani ka zamana tha, hai na? Uske bare mein aapko kya bataye? Abhi batane se humari poori pole khul jayegi. Aur yeh sarwajanik karyakaram hai, log thoda sa phir sochenge 'Acha aisa tha woh?' Humara impression kharab ho jayega (I am now married and have grandkids too. Those were the days of my youth, if I share all of this now, my image will suffer as this is a family show. People will pass comments about me).""

Here are a few films worth adding to your watchlist:
1.Sholay– Prime Video
Dharmendra as Veeru is one of hismost lovedroles. His comic timing in the water tank scene and his chemistry with Hema Malini give the film its lighter moments. Oh, and how can we forget his oh-so-famous dialogue, “Basanti, in kutto ke samne mat nachna”?
2.Chupke Chupke– Prime Video
This Hrishikesh Mukherjee comedy shows Dharmendra's playful side. His role as the botany professor pretending to be a driver is a treat to watch. Sharmila Tagore, Amitabh Bachchan and Jaya Bachchan are also part of the project.
3.Dream Girl– Prime Video
InDream Girl, Dharmendra teamed up with Hema Malini for a colourful, fun entertainer. The story plays with disguises, misunderstandings and feel-good moments. What stands out is Dharmendra's easy on-screen chemistry with Hema Malini.
4.Seeta Aur Geeta– JioHotstar
Even though the story focuses on Hema Malini's double role, Dharmendra's presence adds energy. His character Raka is rough on the outside but soft at heart. One of the most iconic scenes is when he helps Geeta fight back with confidence.
5.Phool Aur Patthar– Prime Video
This is one of the films that established Dharmendra as a strong leading man. His performance as the rugged criminal with a hidden soft core won a lot of praise. The movie was released in 1966.
6.Mera Gaon Mera Desh– Zee5
The film has solid action and a tight storyline. Dharmendra's transformation from a carefree troublemaker to a responsible hero feels convincing. The showdown scenes are still counted among his best early action moments.
7.Yaadon Ki Baaraat– Zee5
This Nasir Hussain classic blends family drama with action and music. Dharmendra's role, though brief, sets the tone for the emotional journey of the film. The songYaadon Ki Baaraat Nikli Hai Aajis still iconic.
8.The Burning Train– JioHotstar
This star-studded thriller also features Vinod Khanna, Hema Malini, Jeetendra, Parveen Babi and Neetu Kapoor. The story follows the Super Express, a train that ends up catching fire during its very first journey from New Delhi to Mumbai. The film is inspired by the 1974 Hollywood disaster classicThe Towering Inferno.
9.Dharam Veer– Prime Video
Want to see Dharmendra in a larger-than-life role? This movie is what you need to watch. The costumes, sets, and action scenes make it worth rewatching. The sword fights and dramatic reveals provide old-school charm.
10.Batwara– Prime Video
Set around the aftermath of Partition,Batwarabrings out Dharmendra's serious side. Some of the confrontation scenes still hold up because of the actor's intensity. The film, released in 1989, is directed by JP Dutta.

He visited the legendary actor's home soon after he returned from the hospital.
Dharmendra died at 89 on November 24, just weeks before his 90th birthday. He had been unwell for some time and was admitted to Mumbai's Breach Candy Hospital on November 10. After being discharged, he continued treatment at home.
His cremation took place on the same day in Mumbai and was attended by several prominent stars, including Amitabh Bachchan, Salman Khan, Aamir Khan, Salim Khan and Shah Rukh Khan.
Earlier this week, the Deol family organised a prayer meet titled Celebration of Life in honour of the actor. Shah Rukh Khan, Salman Khan, Rekha, Aishwarya Rai and others from the film fraternity were seen at the gathering, paying tribute to the beloved star.

She attended the prayer meet held at Hema Malini's residence on Thursday and said the family, friends and fans are all grieving deeply.
Looking back at her earliest interactions with Dharmendra, Sunita recalled performing with him on stage.
She said, ""I had performed with Dharam ji on Sony TV to 'Chalkaye Jaam'. I had shared the stage with him... it was so special for me. I respect him and his family a lot. I'm very close to Esha Deol too... my whole family is. We are big fans of Dharmendra ji.""
She added, ""In fact, I got married to Govinda because I felt he resembled Dharmendra. He is not that handsome; Dharmendra ji was the most handsome man in the industry. He was a true He Man of the industry and worked till the very last. He was a true desi, a largehearted man.""
She also met Dharmendra a few months ago during Ganesh Chaturthi celebrations. ""I met him two months earlier during Ganpati. I went with my son Yashvardhan. Esha had invited me for Ganpati. When Yash was born, I always wished that he had the qualities and looks of Amitabh Bachchan and Dharmendra.""
Sunita added that her husband Govinda, had already met the Deol family soon after the actor's death. ""Yash and I are very much in contact with Esha. Hema ji also loves us a lot. After Dharmendra ji passed away, Govinda had visited Sunny and Bobby Deol to pay condolences. I couldn't go then as I was not in Mumbai. When I returned, I got to know about the prayer meet. So I went there on Thursday.""
She said she missed the earlier prayer meet organised by the Deols at Taj Lands End. ""I couldn't go there. I just met Hema ji and Esha. Govinda went to pay tribute to Dharam ji at the prayer meet.""
Sunita attended the gathering with her son, Yashvardhan Ahuja. Mahima Chaudhry and Esha Deol's former husband Bharat Takhtani were also present.
Dharmendra, one of Indian cinema's most beloved stars, died on November 24 due to age-related ailments.
After a brief hospitalisation at Mumbai's Breach Candy Hospital, he was shifted to the family home in Juhu, where he continued treatment.
The Deol family held a prayer meeting on Thursday, which saw many from the film industry, including Shah Rukh Khan and his family, Salman Khan, Aishwarya Rai, Abhishek Bachchan, Sanjay Dutt, Malaika Arora and others, come together to pay their respects.
The gathering concluded with singer Sonu Nigam performing some of Dharmendra's most cherished songs, as the family chose to honour his legacy with music and memories.

The family, in their petition, has alleged that the film heavily draws inspiration from Major Mohit Sharma's life, undercover mission, and martyrdom without the family's or the Indian Army's consent.
The family is being represented by advocates Roopenshu Pratap Singh and Manish Sharma of Samaanta Law Firm (SLF).
According to the petition, several elements shown in the Dhurandhar trailer and promotional material ""unmistakably mirror"" Major Sharma's military career, including counter-terrorism operations conducted in Kashmir.
Ever since the trailer was released, several media reports and online discussions have repeatedly drawn parallels between Ranveer's character and Major Mohit Sharma.
The family alleged that neither the makers acknowledged this association, nor did they consult the family during the making of the film or afterwards.
The plea emphasized that ""a martyr is not a commercial commodity"" and that his life cannot be recreated ""for profit, without truth, dignity, or due permission.""
The family argues that the film's unauthorized depiction infringes upon Major Sharma's posthumous personality rights under Article 21 of the Constitution. They further argue that it violates the family's right to privacy, dignity, and emotional well-being.
The petitioners assert thatDhurandharappears to portray sensitive military strategies, infiltration methods, and operational details without any indication that the filmmakers obtained clearance or script approval from the Indian Army's Additional Directorate General of Public Information (ADGPI).
The ADGPI is the authority that oversees how the Indian Army is represented in films and media. According to the petition, there is no evidence of such required permissions or consultations.
Filmmakers and government bodies are named as respondents.
Those named in the petition include the Union Ministry of Information & Broadcasting, Additional Directorate General of Public Information (ADGPI), director and co-producer Aditya Dhar, Jio Studios, producer Jyoti Deshpande.
The petition requests the Delhi High Court to halt the release ofDhurandharuntil Major Sharma's family is allowed to privately screen the film.
They further seek a declaration making it mandatory for filmmakers to obtain consent from the martyr's legal heirs and the Indian Army before creating or releasing any depiction of a real-life military hero.
The petition from Major Mohit Sharma's family comes after director Aditya Dhar clarified in an X post two days ago that the film is not based on him.
As online chatter about Ranveer Singh's character being inspired by Major Mohit Sharma gained momentum, Aditya Dhar wrote, ""Our film Dhurandhar is not based on the life of braveheart Major Mohit Sharma AC(P) SM. This is an official clarification.""
He further assured that any future attempt to depict the officer's story would be handled with utmost sensitivity and involvement of the family. ""I assure you, if we do make a biopic on Mohit sir in the future, we will do it with full consent and in complete consultation with the family, and in a way that truly honors his sacrifice for the nation and the legacy it has left for all of us,” he added.
Aditya Dhar's response was to a post by Madhur Sharma, brother of the late Major Mohit Sharma, asserting similarities between Ranveer's character and Sharma.
Dhurandhar, boasting a stellar cast featuring Ranveer Singh, Sanjay Dutt, R Madhavan, Akshay Khanna, and Arjun Rampal, will release in theatres on December 5.

The actor reminisced about their journey, sharing how the beloved 1997 hit remains special not just for its success, but for the bond it strengthened between him and Kajol. Taking to Instagram, Ajay shared a still from the film along with a wedding photo and a family picture. His caption read, “Jaise hua acha hi hua hai... #28YearsOfIshq.”
The first image carried the text “Ishq Hua,” the wedding photo featured “Kaise Hua,” and the final family picture showed the couple with their children with the words “Acha Hua.”
A post shared by Ajay Devgn (@ajaydevgn)
Ishq,directed by Indra Kumar, featured Aamir Khan, Ajay Devgn, Juhi Chawla and Kajol in lead roles. Dalip Tahil, Sadashiv Amrapurkar, Johnny Lever and Mohan Joshi appeared in supporting roles. Released on 28 November 1997, “Ishq” became a major box-office success, earning over Rs 500 million worldwide and finishing as the third highest-grossing Hindi film of the year.
In the film, Ajay Devgn was paired opposite Kajol, making their on-screen chemistry one of its key highlights.
For the unversed, Kajol and Ajay first first crossed paths on the sets of their 1995 filmHulchul, a project Kajol joined after the untimely passing of lead actress Divya Bharti. They went on to date for nearly four years, keeping their relationship away from the public eye. On February 24, 1999, they got married in an intimate ceremony at their Mumbai home, followed by a two-month honeymoon across Europe.
The couple welcomed their daughter, Nysa, on April 20, 2003. Seven years later, on September 13, 2010, they were blessed with their son, Yug.
During her appearance onNo Filter Nehain 2018, Kajol revealed that many people doubted whether her marriage to Ajay was a good idea and shared how she eventually convinced her father to support the decision. The actress had shared, “Nobody wanted us to get married besides his family and my family. My family also was iffy. My dad (late filmmaker Shomu Mukherjee) didn't talk to me for a week when I told him I wanted to get married. He was just like, ‘Why do you want to get married, you're so young and your career is doing so well,' and I was like, ‘But I want to get married!.”

Its search for an answer takes it nowhere in particular.
But inevitably for a film dedicated to ""Mahadev and his Ganga"",Tere Ishk Meinmakes a brief stopover in the holy city of Benaras, where a priest-philosopher (Mohammed Zeeshan Ayyub in a special appearance) holds forth on love, death and salvation.
The lead actors, Dhanush and Kriti Sanon, playing characters named Shankar (God) and Mukti (salvation), do all that they can to convey intensity and passion, but the mess that they are called upon to sort out is too bloated to be wished away by their game efforts or washed away by the waters of the Ganga.
A large part of the trouble withTere Ishk Meinis that it is helmed by a man and written by two other men, Himanshu Sharma and Neeraj Yadav. They believe that they know the effect that hyper-masculine aggression can have on a woman who holds that men, at least some of them, are capable of redeeming themselves, no matter how much damage they cause in doing so.
The film hems and haws its way through a story of obsession that is thwarted by a mammoth class and temperament divide between a hot-headed Delhi University student leader who needs little provocation to resort to force and a senior bureaucrat's studious daughter working on a thesis on violence and how it is possible to curb it if one tries hard enough.
About 30 minutes in, it is as clear as daylight that the film's central premise is unconscionably contrived. Mukti Behniwaal (Kriti Sanon), faced with scepticism from her PhD guides who tell her in so many words that her line of thinking is fanciful, is bent upon proving her theory that violence-prone Alpha males can be reformed and turned into docile beings.
She talks Shankar Gurrukkul (Dhanush), the aforementioned belligerent guy who thinks nothing of beating people to pulp, into serving as a human guinea pig for her experiments aimed at substantiating her 2200-page submission.
Wonder of wonders, the man agrees to help out because she is a beautiful woman and Valentine's Day is around the corner. That is how outrageously 'inventive' the screenplay is: the Beauty not only tries to tame the Beast, but she also prods the ogre to get in touch with his softer side and give decency a chance. Pretty pat and fatuously facile.
Mukti insists that her 'relationship' with Shankar would be 'work' and nothing more. But the latter takes the frequent meetings very seriously until Mukti turns the tables on him after he insists that all work and no play can make Shankar a dull boy.
But when she does offer the guy an opportunity for some fun, he freezes and takes to his heels. But this is not where Tere Ishk Mein begins. It starts off in the air. Literally. And as the story unfolds, no matter how high it wants to fly, it never ceases to be airy-fairy, when it is not outright disconcerting.
When we first meet the male protagonist, he is Flight-lieutenant Shankar Gurrukkal, an irascible and overconfident fighter pilot averse to taking orders. He first flies too low and then too high. When he returns to terra firma after an unauthorised sortie, he is grounded for insubordination.
A counsellor is summoned to work with Shankar and rid him of his anger issues. The lady who is assigned to the task is Mukti Behniwaal. She is heavily pregnant, drunk and in no physical condition to take up the job.
But she does because, seven years ago in Delhi University, their paths had crossed and the one-sided affair had ended in disaster. The rest of the film, which darts back and forth between the Leh station of the Indian Air Force and the DU campus and its surroundings, is devoted to spelling out the whys and wherefores of the imbroglio that puts Muti beyond the reach of Shankar.
The things that transpire between Shankar and Mukti and between Shankar and Mukti's ill-mannered IAS officer-dad (Tota Roy Chowdhury) over a runtime of nearly three hours are difficult to digest given that the lady in the muddle is a qualified psychologist who should know better than pushing the man over the edge while letting him mess with her mind.
The encounters between the two are discomfiting, too, given the ease with which Shankar toys with Mukti, pushing her further and further into a corner. Why must a woman put up with a man who keeps trifling with her against her will even when she drops huge hints that her world and Shankar's are different and ne'er the twain shall meet.
There are points in the film when the boorish man is sought to be passed off as a victim (you've guessed it, there is childhood trauma lurking in the backdrop but it has nothing to do with his benign court notary-dad, played by Prakash Raj).
It gets worse when the weight of guilt is transferred to Mukti when Shankar needs another escape route. The gaslighting has an effect and the woman begins to question her own choices in the matter of her treatment of Shankar.
Tere Ishk Meinis the sort of movie where the negotiations between human beings is strictly via declamatory ultimatums. Shankar's boss, Group Captain Shekhawat (Vineet Kumar Singh), indulges in constant brinkmanship with his best but troubled pilot, so does Mukti's class-conscious father with a boy who will not take no for an answer.
As for the now-on, now-off relationship between Mukti and Shankar, it is always a case of clear threats being held out: alternating between ""you do this or else"" and ""I will do this only if you do that"". That is about the only way in which the circuitous and chaotic plot is attempted to be advanced.
This is ""an A.R. Rahman musical"". That's a small mercy. While the score works, little else in the film is music.Tere Ishk Meinis a love story that is an advertisement that love can do without.

He recounted how a routine walk to the officers' mess in Leh took a dramatic turn when a rifle was suddenly aimed at them. In his recent post on Instagram, Sanjay paid a heartfelt tribute to his late friend and co-star Dharmendra. He reminisced about their early days on the sets ofHaqeeqatin Leh in 1966, long before Dharmendra became a superstar.
Sanjay highlighted Dharmendra's mischievous, fun-loving personality that could light up even a freezing Ladakhi night. Sanjay also honoured Dharmendra's memory, noting that those who truly knew him will never forget him.
Sharing a throwback photo, the actor-producer wrote, “Long before the world knew him as a star, I knew Dharam as the young man who could turn a freezing Ladakhi night into pure mischief. We were in Leh in 1966, shooting Chetan Anand's Haqeeqat, when a simple walk back to the officers' mess ended with a rifle aimed at us and a sentry screaming in the dark.”
“Between our drunken bravado, a mountain of laughter, and that sudden brush with danger, a lifelong friendship took shape. Those who knew you will never forget you. Rest in peace my friend!”
A post shared by Sanjay Khan (@sanjaykhan03)
In the throwback image, Sanjay Khan and Dharmendra sit together while Salman Khan joins them for a memorable moment. The photo also features Sanjay's late wife, Zarine Khan, seated alongside them.
Haqeeqat featured Dharmendra, Balraj Sahni, Priya Rajvansh, Sudhir, Sanjay Khan and Vijay Anand in major roles. Set against the backdrop of the Battle of Rezang La in Ladakh, the film offered a fictionalized portrayal of the 5 JAT soldiers' heroics during the 1962 war and is celebrated as one of India's most iconic black-and-white war films.

Writer and director JK Chandru, who is known for his writing work in Vijay'sGreatest Of All Timesand Silambarasan'sMaanaadu, returns to direction a decade after his directorial debut,Naveena Saraswati Sabatham.
Revolver Rita,set in Pondicherry, we are introduced to Rita (Keerthy Suresh), an employee in a chicken fast food joint, who leads a simple but blissful middle class life with her mother Radhika Sarathkumar and two sisters (Gayatri Shan and Akshathaa Ajit).
Rita is a no-nonsense girl who has to ensure her younger sister clears the NEET to become a doctor and her married-to-a-drunkard sister makes a better life for herself and her young child. Rita's world turns topsy turvy during the birthday celebration of her niece in their small rental home when dreaded Pondicherry gangster, Dracula Pandian, barges inside their home brandishing a gun.
A shocked Rita and her mother confront him resulting in his death and total chaos ensues when her sisters also land up. Now, it's up to these four women to figure out what to do the corpse and ensure they escape the long arms of the law.
Enter Andhra don Reddy (Ajay Ghosh) who wants Pandian dead as revenge and he promptly puts out a hit on him through Martin and his men. Now, why does he want to kill him? Cut next to Dracula Pandian's sons.
A deadly Dracula Bobby, played by Sunil, and a comical younger brother Cheetah, played by Redin Kingsley, panic when their father doesn't return home the next day. The duo and their gang set off on a wild goose chase to nab their father's kidnappers/murderers while in Rita's home, it all falls on her shoulders to get rid of Pandian's body and steer her family to safety.
A family of innocent women caught in a horrific situation; a series of crimes, criminals and dons, and obviously, the police, lends itself beautifully to a dark comedy. The first half of the film introduces the various characters and sets up the background of Rita and her family and the issues they face given there is no 'man of the house'.
Rita's father dies by suicide when she was a child and her mother brings up the three girls by working in people's homes. We are made to understand Rita's emotional status and the motivations that push her towards the grey in a world where black and white didn't support them. The second half shifts gears and moves into more action, cat-and-mouse games and the plot of the film. The various characters come together to we connect the missing dots as the movie unfolds.
Director JK Chandru, who has proved his writing skills in numerous successful films, has craftedRevolver Ritawith all the elements of a dark comedy right from humour in tragedy (like Dracula Pandian's death) and Rita's moral ambiguity which is quite grey, to the absurd situations that arise (numerous gangsters double and triple-crossing one another) over the 145 minutes.
However, what lets downRevolver Ritais a poorly written screenplay that sees no novelty factor, emotional connect and repetitive gang fight action scenes (particularly in the second half) that slows down the film. There is no novelty factor as it has an oft-repeated theme of an underdog woman, starring in a women-centric drama, who wants payback for injustice.
The narrative has no freshness to keep the audience engaged and the linear progression, which has been infused with comedy via Redin Kingsley and Radhika Sarathkumar, doesn't really lift the film. The film rests solely on the shoulders of Rita but her character has not been really well-etched out either as it has no depth.
One is forced to compareRevolver Ritawith Nayanthara'sKolamaavu Kokila(which this movie reminds us of). InKolamaavu Kokila, there was a strong emotional quotient and Nayanthara's character arc was well-written so we see her grow from a timid woman to a strong one who threatens criminals. Kokila is also naturally funny because she does silly things that stem from her awkwardness.
One misses an arc like this with Rita and that's a let-down as the audience doesn't become invested in her or the other female characters and empathise with them. The sole emotional hook lies in the suicide of Rita's father and that backstory is not compelling enough either. Rita's sisters too don't have much to do in the film except scurrying around her like deer caught in headlights and the drunk brother-in-law (Shankar) was a character that could've been given a miss.
Having said that, there are flashes of brilliance that the director displays like the brief 1950s style Tamil cinema 'romantic' segment in the second half between Rita and a gangster; along with Radhika's sudden emotional outburst when she yells, ""Athai solarain, nee soodu!"" to a gangster (Your mother-in-law is telling you, shoot him).
One wishes there were more of these interspersed through the film to surprise the audience and elicit more laughs.Revolver Ritais very stylish in its making and visuals but the lack of inventive storytelling and the constant swerves between action, dark comedy and action, make it tough to enjoy the experience. Music director Sean Roldan deserves a mention as it's the BGM that helps elevate numerous scenes, some of which are mundane.
With regard to performances, Keerthy Suresh, Radhika Sarathkumar, Sunil and Redin Kingsley deliver their roles effortlessly and are ably supported by the others. Keerthy Suresh displays toughness and vulnerability in equal measure when required and her committed performance is to be appreciated.Revolver Ritawas a good shot for director JK Chandru to showcase his talent but the movie's uneven screenplay backfires for him unfortunately.

Now, the actress has spoken her heart out in a recent interview with a media portal. She not only shared how Rekha reacted after watching120 Bahadurbut also shed light on a very important ongoing debate - the 'objectification' of women in South cinema.
Talking about the portrayal of women in the South industry, Raashii told Zoom, ""It is very important that I should be comfortable with what I am doing. If I feel like a line is being crossed and I might look cheap in it, I will say no to it. Every actor has a different comfort zone, and I don't judge.""
She further added, ""Coming to the projection of women, it is not just a South thing; I see it in the North quite a lot. It completely depends on the choice of the actor. Some people are comfortable with it, some are not. I have done so many commercial films in the South that I feel I should take that step forward in Hindi and get into content. I am okay doing commercial stuff, but I also have a limit. Every actor's limit is different, and that defines who they are.""

Here's What Rekha Told Raashii After Watching 120 Bahadur
Raashii also recalled Rekha's reaction after watching 120 Bahadur and said, ""Rekha ji had tears in her eyes when she saw 120 Bahadur. I asked her, 'Can I hug you?' She said, 'No, can I hug you?' She hugged me and told Farhan sir and I was there - she spoke about how my character touched her in the last scene and made her cry. She was quite emotional for a very long time. When someone like her says things like that, I feel I may have done something right. That is the kind of validation I seek from my peers and seniors, and also from the audience. I felt fulfilled that night.""

Alisha had a stellar run in the 90s and 2000s. But since 2013, she has recorded only one song for a Hindi film— Zindagi Meri Dance Dance in the 2017 film Daddy. Her last hit was Dil Tu Hi Bata fromKrrish 3(2013).
Apart from film music, Alisha has made a distinct name in the Indi-pop scene. Her albums Babydoll and Bombay Girl established her as a distinctive voice in the arena of pop music. But it was the success of Made in India in 1997 that made her a household name across India.

https://www.ndtv.com/entertainment/andhra-king-taluka-review-ram-pothineni-makes-a-strong-comeback-in-this-feel-good-drama-9715044,Andhra King TalukaReview: Ram Pothineni Makes A Strong Comeback In This Feel-Good Drama,"Fri, 28 Nov 2025 14:32:58 +0530","Indian movie stars thrive thanks to their ardent fans andAndhra King Taluka,starring Ram Pothineni, Upendra and Bhagyashri Borse, looks at exactly this fan culture, fan-star relationship and its impact on people's lives.
Sagar (Ram Pothineni) is a hardcore fan of 'Andhra King' Surya (Upendra) and will do anything for him. But to what extent will he go for his screen idol and the love of his life, Mahalakshmi (Bhagyashri Borse)?
Like what we see in real life in south India, Sagar, who hails from a small remote village called Godapalli Lanka (Godavari district), wants to catch superstar Surya Kumar's latest film in Mahalakshmi Theatre in the nearby town.
His father (Rao Ramesh) promises to take him if he excels in English and an excited Sagar holds his father to his promise. His bad luck, however, sees the movie running housefull and his father's plea to the fans' association head for two tickets has no impact.
The fans' head questions what they have done for the star and the 10-year-old hits upon a brilliant idea. He takes off his shirt to write something and scurries up the wooden ladder to put it up next to Surya Kumar's huge cut-out for the world to see - his shirt reads 'Andhra King Surya' giving the superstar a new name and Sagar instant fame.
As he grows older, Sagar engages in all that a fan does for his on-screen dol before every release - he sticks posters, puts up huge cut-outs, bursts firecrackers, does milkabhishekams(milk bath) for the cut-outs, throws torn tickets into the air, and whistles and screams louder than anyone at his hero's antics in each and every film. he eventually becomes the president of the Surya Kumar Fans's Aassociation in his area and the tag sticks on as that becomes his job as well.
Interestingly, even when he finds love, it is cinema that is a pain point as he's called 'nothing but a fan of Surya Kumar' and yet, it is also cinema that comes to his rescue.
On the other side, we see an aging superstar Surya, who is struggling to find a producer to finance his 100th film and who is possibly looking at the demise of his once illustrious career. When he tries to get a loan of Rs 3 crore from a financier, he is stunned to see the financier make a mockery out of the star who offers him a character role in his son's debut film.
Surya Kumar, a once celebrated hero, finds himself being relegated to the has-beens and it is an emotional blow for him. But someone deposits Rs 3 crore in his account. Who and why for the rest of the story. It is at this exact moment, we see Surya and Sagar connect - literally like the sun and the sea during sunset, and we are shown how it is a new sunrise for the two of them when the director takes us to the backstory of Sagar.
Andhra King Talukais a Bildungsroman story that showcases how a young boy from a small village called Godapalli Lanka, that has no electricity or economic opportunities, uses cinema to help himself and his village.
Like most hardcore star fans, Sagar lives, eats and breathes cinema and his thoughts, actions and dreams all revolve around and are shaped by cinema. P Mahesh Babu, who has written and directed the film, has made sure that he has included all the signature elements that fans indulge and engage in in south cinema (especially Tamil and Telugu) but he has deftly refrained from turning the story into a psychological analysis or negative inspection of the star-fan relationship.
The director has also ensured that he showcases the other side - the realities an ageing superstar faces and how vulnerable the star becomes once their light starts to fade. Age is not kind to those on screen and as much as they try to be relevant and hold on to their fame, it can slip away easily as time goes.
The story is emotional, endearing and tells us how someone who is a nobody to a star can have a massive impact on his life and vice versa. The entire film revolves around a star, a fan, a theatre, a theatre owner and his daughter. Sagar's world is small and confined to cinema but it is also larger-than-life as it resembles a movie in itself. But the storyline mixes rural politics, personal loyalty, and the clash between tradition and modern aspirations of those in the village.
Unlike those who believe that fans and fanatical behaviour can destroy society, Mahesh Babu has shown the positive side of this which is uplifting and heart-warming. The storyline of the film is predictable and the film does have some lags, particularly in the middle portions.
Mahalakshmi's character could have had more depth as well. The editing needed to have been tighter but it is engaging for the most part thanks to earnest performances by the cast. The songs by Vivek and Mervin are par for the course with perfunctory numbers for the front benchers and the romantics.
Ram Pothineni, who has had several bad films in the last few years, is back in the reckoning withAndhra King Talukawith his solid (but sometimes over-the-top) performance as Sagar. The actor is relatable, energetic and charming, with impactful dramatic moments ensuring mass appeal.
Kannada star Upendra essays superstar Surya Kumar with ease and his layered performance as a star losing his shine stands out as he displays vulnerability and wisdom.
Rahul Ramakrishna as Sagar's friend has superb timing with his dialogue delivery which elicits laughs, while Bhagyashri Borse is on a roll with a top-notch performance here too, likeKaantha. She displays grace and sincerity in the role of Maheshwari and the chemistry between her and Ram Pothineni, particularly in some of the scenes in the second half, is very natural and endearing. On the whole,Andhra King Talukais a strong comeback for Ram Pothineni and another win for Bhagyashri Borse.
